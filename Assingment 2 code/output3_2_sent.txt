START as a result , although we still make use of this distinction , there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed STOP
START just what is meant by `` spirit '' and by `` matter '' ? ? STOP
START the terms are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and UNK elements in the common experience of all STOP
START yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do STOP
START for in the modern world neither `` spirit '' nor `` matter '' refer to any generally UNK elements of experience STOP
START we are in a UNK stage in which many of the UNK of former usage have had to be revised or rejected STOP
START when the words are used , we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the UNK may have in mind , or to what extent his UNK and UNK of former UNK UNK to ours STOP
START one of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal UNK in the reality of spirit STOP
START just a few centuries ago the world of spirits was as UNK and real as the world of material UNK STOP
START not only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as well was this true STOP
START UNK , UNK , UNK , and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the UNK world of western man as were UNK and trees and stars STOP
START in such a world the words `` matter '' and `` spirit '' both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all STOP
START in it important elements of christianity and of the UNK view of reality in general , which now cause us much difficulty , could be responded to quite naturally and UNK STOP
START the progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of UNK by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent UNK the spirit world of the UNK which previously UNK it STOP
START in carrying out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit STOP
START the UNK of the world of spirit in popular UNK had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support STOP
START science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which UNK from an object in space and time STOP
START when , therefore , it turned its attention to the concrete UNK with which popular imagination had UNK the world of spirit , these UNK soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality STOP
START in doing so science has UNK UNK up widespread UNK , removed UNK and UNK sources of fear , and UNK many UNK popular UNK STOP
START there have been , indeed , many important and valuable UNK from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be UNK UNK STOP
START all this has not , however , been an UNK UNK STOP
START the scientific UNK of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough STOP
START the house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means , or at best with wholly inadequate means , for dealing with his experience of spirit STOP
START although the particular form of UNK which popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit was undoubtedly UNK , the raw experience itself which led to such UNK remains with us as UNK as ever STOP
START we simply find ourselves in the position of having no means for UNK into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience STOP
START there is no UNK or structure of thought with respect to which we can UNK it and no part of reality , as we know and UNK it , with respect to which we can refer this experience STOP
START science has simply left us helpless and UNK in this important sector of our lives STOP
START the situation in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in arthur UNK play the UNK , which deals with the salem UNK trials STOP
START as the play UNK the audience is introduced to the community of salem in UNK america at the end of the eighteenth century STOP
START aside from a UNK concern with UNK and UNK which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene , it is a quite normal community STOP
START the conversation of the characters UNK an atmosphere UNK the usual mixture of UNK , UNK , UNK , and concerns which would UNK the common life of a normal village in any age STOP
START there is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people STOP
START instead , the audience can sit back at ease and , from the perspective of an UNK time which no longer believes in such things , enjoy the dead UNK with which the characters in the play take the UNK and UNK which are under discussion STOP
START a UNK girl , UNK UNK , is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle , the UNK samuel UNK , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings STOP
START for all involved in this discussion the devil is a real UNK who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the UNK world is UNK with real creatures , and UNK actually can be seen flying through the air STOP
START as the play UNK , however , the audience is UNK brought into the UNK of an UNK evil which grows with UNK gathering power and soon UNK the community STOP
START everyone in salem , UNK and UNK alike , is swept up by it STOP
START it is like a mysterious epidemic which , starting first with UNK and UNK , UNK UNK with a UNK growing UNK through the whole town until all have been UNK by it STOP
START it grows UNK and UNK in power and leaves in its UNK a trail of misery , moral UNK , and destruction STOP
START the audience leaves the play under a UNK , it is the kind of UNK which the exposure to spirit in its living active UNK always UNK STOP
START if one UNK about this play , what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power , there is no better answer to give than `` spirit '' STOP
START this is not to attempt to say what spirit is , but only to UNK a commonly used word to UNK or simply identify a common experience STOP
START in the end the good man , john UNK , UNK what the audience has already come to feel when he says , `` a fire , a fire is burning ! ! STOP
START i hear the UNK of UNK , i see his UNK face '' ! ! STOP
START the tragic UNK of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and UNK with UNK set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from UNK the real devil when he came among them STOP
START we UNK at their blindness for not seeing this STOP
START yet are not we of the UNK century , who UNK do not believe there is any such `` thing '' as the devil , just as bad off as they -- only in a different way ? ? STOP
START in our UNK we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the UNK power which is so UNK real in this play STOP
START we are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would UNK a UNK to that which has already been UNK and proved false STOP
START even UNK himself seems UNK on this score STOP
START in a long UNK which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play , he says at one point : `` however , that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the UNK or the existence of UNK UNK UNK STOP
START and his belief is not to his UNK STOP
START better minds than UNK were -- and still are -- convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond our UNK '' STOP
START ( page UNK ) on the other hand , a little later on he says : `` since UNK a great but UNK change has UNK out god's UNK and the UNK UNK , but the world is still UNK between two UNK opposed UNK STOP
START the concept of unity , in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force , in which good and evil are relative , UNK , and always joined to the same phenomenon -- such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who have UNK the history of ideas STOP
START when we see the steady and UNK UNK into humanity of the idea of man's UNK -- until UNK -- the necessity of the devil may become evident as a weapon , a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to UNK men into a surrender to a particular church or UNK '' STOP
START ( page 34 ) STOP
START apparently he does not UNK that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being actually real STOP
START yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the UNK of the terrible power and UNK of that which came over salem STOP
START it UNK a UNK upon them so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power STOP
START it is not enough in accounting for this feeling to UNK it into the UNK of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect STOP
START for this does not account for the integral , UNK power of that which grows with UNK UNK as the play UNK , nor does it explain the strange UNK sense of UNK which comes over those who watch the play like a UNK STOP
START the reality of spirit UNK in this play in spite of the UNK convictions to the contrary STOP
START spirit and community STOP
START there is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and UNK felt than spirit STOP
START apart from spirit there could be no community , for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity , UNK , and UNK STOP
START think , for example , of the spirit of the marine corps STOP
START surely this is a reality we all UNK STOP
START we cannot , of course , assign it any substance STOP
START it is not material and is not a `` thing '' UNK space and time STOP
START yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known STOP
START so it is too with many other spirits which we all know : the spirit of UNK or communism , school spirit , the spirit of a street corner UNK or a UNK team , the spirit of UNK or the UNK UNK UNK STOP
START every community , if it is alive has a spirit , and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity STOP
START in UNK for UNK which might lead us to a fresh UNK of the reality of spirit , the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove the most UNK STOP
START for it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit STOP
START it is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to UNK STOP
START it is the spirit which is the source of a UNK drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from the world outside so that the community grows and UNK STOP
START yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community STOP
START the idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and UNK ideas STOP
START one characteristic of the spirit in community is its UNK STOP
START the members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them STOP
START it is for them a given which they and they alone possess STOP
START the spirit of the marine corps was present and UNK before any of the present members of it came into it STOP
START it is they , of course , who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the corps for future UNK to find as they come into it STOP
START if the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be `` UNK of the people '' -- and this , it must not be forgotten , is one of the goals of the UNK theological task -- there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation STOP
START this does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching STOP
START the absurd notion that UNK UNK the UNK of all mythological concepts completely UNK UNK intention STOP
START his point is not that UNK may not be used , but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate UNK for expressing the christian UNK STOP
START when we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned , we mean it must be abandoned as the UNK or proper means for UNK the christian understanding of existence STOP
START mythological concepts may by all means still be used , but they can be used UNK only as `` symbols '' or `` UNK '' , that is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in UNK ( or UNK ) terms STOP
START the statement is often made that when UNK UNK in this way , he `` UNK the intellectual UNK which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the christian faith '' STOP
START but this statement is completely UNK STOP
START if UNK own definition of myth is strictly UNK to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such UNK ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all UNK the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and UNK STOP
START nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are UNK almost entirely UNK and so UNK UNK from the conventional forms in which the UNK has been UNK STOP
START on the contrary , even in the heart of `` the bible belt '' itself , as can be UNK by any one who is called to work there , the industrial and technological UNK have long been under way , together with the corresponding changes in man's picture of himself and his world STOP
START in fact , it is in just such a situation that the UNK of UNK argument is UNK STOP
START although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more UNK situation , the striking thing is the UNK with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence STOP
START this is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class STOP
START time and again in UNK and teaching , one UNK members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the UNK UNK of their `` UNK '' heritage and the UNK reality of the modern world are only too UNK obvious STOP
START the same thing is also evidenced by the extreme `` UNK '' so often observed to UNK the preaching and teaching of the american churches STOP
START in the absence of a truly adequate UNK in which the UNK can be expressed , the UNK need to UNK it makes use of whatever resources are at hand -- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion '' current in the situation STOP
START this is not to say that the only explanation of the present UNK with UNK vincent UNK `` UNK of UNK '' or the other types of a purely cultural christianity is the UNK need for a UNK UNK STOP
START but it is to say that this need is far more important for such UNK than most of the UNK seem to have UNK STOP
START however , even if the UNK demand for UNK is not nearly as widespread as we are UNK , at least among the UNK elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete UNK to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace STOP
START to be sure , when this is pointed out , a common response among certain UNK is to UNK about `` the little UNK '' and `` the great crowd '' and to take UNK from UNK UNK of the `` wisdom of the wise '' in the opening chapter of first UNK STOP
START but can we any longer afford the luxury of such UNK UNK ? ? STOP
START can the church risk assuming that the `` UNK '' of men is as dear to god as their `` wisdom '' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the UNK of god '' and `` the UNK of men '' are simply two ways of talking about the same thing ? ? STOP
START can we continue to UNK precisely those whose UNK we so UNK need and apart from whose UNK our mission in the world must become increasingly UNK ? ? STOP
START there is an ancient and UNK tradition in the church ( which UNK , however , from the heritage of the UNK rather than from the bible ) that god is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for UNK his work in the world STOP
START by analogy , the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the `` world '' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church STOP
START but , as UNK everywhere UNK us , god does have need of his creatures , and the church , a UNK , can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world , by god's providence , presents it STOP
START and yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to UNK the UNK in a form that makes it seem incredible and UNK to UNK men STOP
START until we UNK this UNK into a language that UNK men today can understand , we are UNK ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends STOP
START in UNK in this way , we are obviously taking for granted that a UNK UNK of the UNK can be achieved ; ; STOP
START and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction STOP
START but the main point here is that even if such a UNK were not possible , the demand to UNK the UNK would still be UNK STOP
START this is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition STOP
START if to be a christian means to say yes where i otherwise say no , or where i do not have the right to say anything at all , then my only choice is to UNK to be a christian STOP
START expressed UNK : if the price for becoming a UNK UNK of jesus christ is some form of UNK , whether of the body or of the mind -- UNK UNK , UNK UNK -- then there is no alternative but that the price remain UNK STOP
START this must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this UNK chapter STOP
START modern man , as UNK UNK has told us , has `` come of age '' ; ; STOP
START and though this process by no means represents an UNK gain and is , in fact , marked by the UNK from the depths that seems to be the cost of human UNK , it is still a positive step forward ; ; STOP
START and those of us who so UNK benefit from it should be the last to UNK it STOP
START in any event , it is an UNK step , and if we are at all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which god has seen fit to place us STOP
START to say this , of course , is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years , or , at any rate , since the beginning of the UNK modern period in theological thought STOP
START we have UNK ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition in protestant christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK , and more recently , UNK and the early UNK and , in part at least , UNK STOP
START it is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of american theology also belong STOP
START for we must number here not only the names of UNK , UNK , and UNK , not to mention those of `` the chicago school '' and UNK , but those of the brothers UNK and ( if america may claim him ! ! STOP
START ) UNK as well STOP
START finally , we may also mention the several members of the UNK `` UNK '' movement that developed at the university of chicago and is heavily UNK UNK to the creative work of alfred north UNK STOP
START what makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have UNK to it have been UNK in earnest about being modern men in a UNK modern world STOP
START although they have also been concerned to stand UNK within the tradition of the UNK church , they have UNK no UNK whatever to sacrifice their UNK to their christianity STOP
START they have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from considering this UNK to god , have looked upon it as the only way they could be UNK to him STOP
START when we say , then , that today , in our situation , the demand for UNK must be accepted without condition , we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an UNK achievement STOP
START however much we may have to UNK liberal UNK UNK formulations , the theology we ourselves must UNK to UNK can only go beyond liberalism , not behind it STOP
START in UNK this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the UNK into which UNK attempt to UNK such a theology has led STOP
START for we have said , in effect , that of the two alternatives to his position UNK represented by the other UNK in the UNK discussion , only one is really an alternative STOP
START if the demand for UNK is UNK and so must be accepted by theology UNK , the position of the `` right '' is clearly UNK STOP
START whereas UNK `` center '' position is UNK UNK and is therefore UNK on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right '' , as represented , say , by UNK UNK , involves the UNK or at least UNK of the demand for UNK and so is UNK on the material grounds we have just considered STOP
START it follows , then , provided the possibilities have been UNK , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left '' , which has been represented on the UNK by UNK UNK and , to some extent at least , is found in much that is significant in american and english theology STOP
START in order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length STOP
START we may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other than the three typically represented by UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START to do this , it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to UNK more than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility is a UNK question STOP
START thus , if what is at issue is whether `` all s is p '' , it is UNK whether `` some s is not p '' or `` no s is p '' , since in either case the judgment in question is false STOP
START hence , if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is UNK whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ; ; STOP
START for , in either event , the first possibility is UNK STOP
START therefore , the only UNK alternatives are those represented , on the one hand , by the two at least apparently UNK but mutually exclusive positions of UNK and UNK and , on the other hand , by the third but really UNK position ( UNK to a round square ) of UNK STOP
START a second point requires more extended comment STOP
START it will be UNK from the discussion in section 7 that the position of the `` right '' , as represented by UNK , rests on the following UNK : the only UNK alternative to UNK position is a theology that ( 1 ) UNK or at least UNK his UNK demand for UNK and UNK interpretation ; ; STOP
START ( 2 ) UNK instead a special UNK UNK or method of interpretation ; ; STOP
START and ( 3 ) in so doing , UNK itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event jesus christ by means of statements that , from UNK point of view , are mythological STOP
START one hundred years ago there existed in england the association for the promotion of the unity of UNK STOP
START representing as it did the efforts of only UNK individuals of the roman and anglican churches , and UNK a UNK of prayer UNK to rome , this association produced little fruit , and , in fact , was condemned by the holy office in UNK STOP
START now again in 1961 , in england , there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so UNK discussed as christian unity STOP
START the church unity UNK , january UNK , was UNK devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches STOP
START many people seem UNK , yet it is difficult to UNK whether or not there will be any more real UNK of christian unity in 1961 than there was in UNK STOP
START but it must be readily seen that the religious picture in england has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to UNK hope , at least on the catholic side STOP
START for the `` UNK is well on the turn '' , as the london catholic weekly universe has written STOP
START i came to england last summer to do research on the UNK letters of UNK UNK STOP
START as an american catholic of irish UNK , i came with certain UNK and expectations ; ; STOP
START being UNK influenced by UNK and the general UNK literature of england , i knew only a UNK country STOP
START since arriving here , however , i have formed a far different religious picture of present-day england STOP
START in representing part of this new picture , i will be UNK some of my own personal experiences , reactions and judgments ; ; STOP
START but my primary aim is to UNK what UNK themselves are saying and writing and UNK about the roman and anglican churches and about the present religious state of england STOP
START since the protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some UNK from the wholly black suit , my roman UNK and black UNK usually identify me in england as a roman catholic UNK STOP
START in any case , i have always been treated with the UNK UNK by UNK , even in UNK and UNK , where UNK feeling has UNK existed the strongest and UNK STOP
START nowhere have i seen public expression of UNK STOP
START on my first UNK UNK day here , i found catholics as well as UNK UNK with the traditional UNK and UNK , and was told that most UNK either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day STOP
START a UNK newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled `` the true story of UNK UNK '' , which began : STOP
START `` when you UNK your `` UNK '' on the UNK UNK night , i wonder how much of the true story of UNK UNK you will remember ? ? STOP
START in the UNK years since the first UNK UNK night , much of the story has been forgotten , so here is a UNK '' STOP
START the article proceeded to give an UNK account of a catholic plot to kill king james 1 STOP
START in spite of the increase in numbers and prestige brought about by the UNK of UNK and other UNK of the UNK and UNK , the catholic UNK of england one hundred years ago was a very small one ( four per cent , or UNK ) which did not enjoy a UNK hearing from the general public STOP
START the return of the catholic UNK in UNK was looked upon with UNK UNK and , in fact , was charged with being a gesture of UNK STOP
START in UNK UNK UNK had to write his UNK with his UNK feelings in order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from english readers STOP
START now , in 1961 , the catholic population of england is still quite small ( ten per cent , or 5 million ) ; ; STOP
START yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the UNK population STOP
START a protestant woman UNK to me over the large UNK going in and out of the UNK UNK ( catholic ) church on sunday UNK STOP
START she found this a UNK because , as she said , only six per cent of english people are UNK STOP
START she may not have been exact on this number , but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten STOP
START from many sides come remarks that protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval UNK look all but empty during services STOP
START a catholic priest recently UNK how in the chapel of a large city university , following anglican UNK , at which there was a congregation of twelve , he UNK mass before more than a hundred STOP
START the protestant themselves are the first to admit the great falling off in effective membership in their churches STOP
START according to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the church of england , the `` total of UNK members is UNK , but only UNK are registered on the UNK church UNK '' , and `` over 27 million people in england are UNK into the church of england , but roughly only a UNK of them continue '' STOP
START an amazing article in the manchester UNK of last november , entitled `` fate of UNK churches '' , states than an UNK commission `` reported last month that in the church of england alone there are UNK churches which are UNK now , or will be in 20 UNK time STOP
START a further UNK anglican churches have been UNK since 1948 '' STOP
START and in the last five years , the `` UNK chapel committee has authorized the UNK or , more often , the sale of UNK UNK '' STOP
START most of these former churches are now used as UNK , but `` neither UNK nor UNK object to selling churches to roman catholics '' , and have done so STOP
START while it must be said that these same protestants have built some new churches during this period , and that religious population shifts have UNK churches , a principal reason for this phenomenon of UNK is that fewer protestants are going to church STOP
START it should be admitted , too , that there is a good percentage of UNK or UNK catholics ( one paper writes 50 per cent ) STOP
START still , it is clear from such reports , and apparently clear from the remarks of many people , that protestants are UNK and catholics increasing STOP
START an anglican UNK in oxford UNK but UNK UNK to me that this is true STOP
START a century ago , UNK saw that liberalism ( what we now might call UNK ) would gradually but UNK make its mark on english protestantism , and that even high UNK would UNK no longer be a `` UNK UNK against UNK errors more fundamental than its own '' STOP
START that day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no longer very meaningful to call england a `` protestant country '' STOP
START one of the UNK of the present UNK for christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real christians to UNK STOP
START many english catholics are proud of their UNK and know that they are in a new UNK STOP
START the london universe devoted its UNK issue last december 8 to UNK out various aspects of catholic progress during the last one hundred years STOP
START with traditional UNK spirit , some UNK claim that english UNK is UNK at its best STOP
START i have found myself saying with other UNK here that english catholics are good catholics STOP
START it has been my experience to find as many men as women in church , and to hear almost everyone in church congregations UNK the latin prayers and responses at mass STOP
START they hope , of course , to UNK the UNK population to the catholic faith , and at every sunday UNK they UNK by heart the `` prayer for england '' : STOP
START `` o UNK virgin mary , mother of god and our most gentle queen and mother , look down in mercy upon england , thy `` UNK '' , and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee STOP
START UNK for our separated UNK , that with us in the one true UNK they may be united to the chief UNK , the UNK of thy son STOP
START '' a UNK often to be heard in catholic churches is `` faith of our fathers '' , which UNK in UNK ancient faith that UNK UNK , and which UNK : `` faith of our fathers : UNK prayers shall win our country back to thee '' STOP
START the english UNK are widely UNK , quite naturally , and now there is great hope that the forty UNK and UNK UNK will soon be UNK STOP
START because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers , english catholics have always strongly UNK the charge of being `` UNK '' STOP
START i have not seen this charge made during my stay here , but apparently it is still in the air STOP
START for example , a writer in a recent number of the queen UNK states that `` of the UNK UNK the only one which the english catholics really UNK is the suggestion that they are ' UNK ' '' STOP
START in this connection , it has been observed that the increasing number of irish catholics , priests and UNK , in england , while certainly seen as good for UNK , is nevertheless a source of UNK for some of the more UNK english catholics , especially when these UNK offer to UNK their christian UNK of this good STOP
START one of the more UNK changes that have taken place since the UNK century is the situation of catholics at oxford and cambridge universities STOP
START at oxford one hundred years ago there were very few catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in UNK STOP
START moreover , for those few there was almost no UNK representation in the city to care for their religious needs STOP
START now , not only are there considerably more UNK as students and professors at oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the UNK members of the university STOP
START some catholic priests UNK there ; ; STOP
START catholic UNK attend UNK and row on the UNK with UNK students STOP
START further evidence that roman UNK UNK a more favorable position today than in UNK is the UNK attention given to it in the mass UNK of england STOP
START the general tone of articles UNK in such important newspapers as the manchester UNK and the sunday observer implies a UNK recognition that the catholic church is now at least of equal UNK in england with the protestant churches STOP
START on UNK UNK during october , 1960 , paul UNK ( a UNK ) wrote articles in the observer UNK UNK of the church of england , the church of rome and the UNK church STOP
START the catholic priest , though somewhat UNK drawn , easily came out the best STOP
START there were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the anglican UNK , who was indeed UNK as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very much to do as UNK STOP
START such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public press of UNK england STOP
START there was so much interest shown in this present-day venture that it was continued on UNK where comments were equally made by an anglican UNK , a free church minister and a catholic priest STOP
START catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs , sometimes discussing the christian faith on an equal UNK with protestant UNK STOP
START a notable example of this was the discussion of christian unity by the catholic UNK of UNK , UNK , and the anglican UNK of york , UNK , recently appointed UNK of UNK STOP
START the good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well known in england STOP
START the holy sacrifice of the mass with UNK has been UNK several times in recent months STOP
START and it was interesting to observe that UNK television film on christmas eve was the UNK of UNK STOP
START of course , the UNK event that has UNK UNK the traditional pattern of english religious history was the friendly visit paid by UNK , then anglican UNK of UNK , to the UNK last december STOP
START it was the first time an english UNK has done this since the UNK century STOP
START english catholics UNK to this event with moderate but real hope STOP
START almost daily something is reported which UNK this catholic hope in england : statistics of the increasing numbers of UNK and irish catholic UNK ; ; STOP
START news of a protestant minister in UNK who has offered to allow a catholic priest to UNK from his UNK ; ; STOP
START a report that a catholic UNK had been UNK to teach in a UNK secondary school during the UNK of one of its UNK ; ; STOP
START the startling statement in a respectable UNK that `` catholics , if the present system is still in operation , will constitute almost one-third of the house of UNK in the next generation '' ; ; STOP
START a report that 200 protestant UNK and UNK attended a UNK mass offered for christian unity at a catholic church in UNK during the church unity UNK STOP
START the death of a man is unique , and yet it is universal STOP
START the straight line would UNK its UNK , the circle its UNK STOP
START but how can one figure UNK both ? ? STOP
START christianity UNK that in the life and death of jesus christ the unique and the universal UNK STOP
START perhaps no church father saw this UNK of the unique and the universal as clearly , or formulated it as precisely , as irenaeus STOP
START to be the UNK and the lord , jesus christ has to be a historical individual with a UNK all his own ; ; STOP
START he dare not be a cosmic UNK that UNK to earth for a while but never UNK itself with man's history STOP
START yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind STOP
START his history is his alone , yet each man must recognize his own history in it STOP
START his death is his alone , yet each man can see his own death in the UNK of jesus STOP
START each man can identify himself with the history and the death of jesus christ because jesus christ has identified himself with human history and human death , coming as the head of a new humanity STOP
START not a circle , then , nor a straight line , but a UNK represents the shape of death as irenaeus sees it ; ; STOP
START for a UNK has motion as well as UNK STOP
START as represented by a UNK , history may , in some sense , be said to repeat itself ; ; STOP
START yet each historical event remains unique STOP
START christ is both unique and universal STOP
START the first turn of the UNK is the UNK history of humanity in adam STOP
START as UNK UNK the end of history on the basis of its beginning , so irenaeus UNK the story of adam on the basis of the story of christ STOP
START `` UNK , then , comes the substance of the first man ? ? STOP
START from god's will and wisdom , and from virgin earth STOP
START for ' god had not UNK ' , says the UNK , before man was made , and there was no man to till the earth STOP
START from this earth , then , while it was still virgin god took dust and UNK the man , the beginning of humanity '' STOP
START irenaeus does not regard adam and eve merely as private individuals , but as universal human beings , who were and are all of humanity STOP
START adam and eve were perfect , not in the sense that they possessed UNK , but in the sense that they were capable of development toward UNK STOP
START they were , in fact , children STOP
START irenaeus does not claim UNK for the human soul ; ; STOP
START therefore there is no need for him , as there is for UNK , to identify existence itself with the fall STOP
START existence is created and UNK by god and is not the consequence of a UNK UNK or of a cosmic UNK from UNK into history STOP
START historical existence is a created good STOP
START the UNK symbol for this UNK is expressed in the words : `` so god created man in his own image ; ; STOP
START in the UNK of god he created him '' STOP
START there are some passages in the writings of irenaeus where the image of god and the UNK are sharply distinguished , so most notably in the statement : `` if the ( holy ) spirit is absent from the soul , such a man is indeed of an animal nature ; ; STOP
START and , being left UNK , he will be an UNK being , UNK the image ( of god ) in his formation , but not receiving the UNK ( of god ) through the spirit '' STOP
START thus the image of god is that which makes a man a man and not an UNK ; ; STOP
START the UNK of god , by contrast , is that which makes a man a child of god and not merely a rational UNK STOP
START recent research on irenaeus , however , makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction STOP
START he does not mean to say that adam lost the UNK of god and his immortality through the fall ; ; STOP
START for he was created not exactly UNK , nor yet exactly UNK , but capable of immortality as well as of UNK STOP
START therefore irenaeus describes man's creation as follows : STOP
START `` so that the man should not have thoughts of UNK , and become UNK up , as if he had no lord , because of the UNK that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against god his creator , UNK his UNK , and take up an attitude of UNK UNK towards god , a law was given him by god , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all STOP
START and he laid down for him certain conditions : so that , if he kept the command of god , then he would always remain as he was , that is , UNK ; ; STOP
START but if he did not , he would become UNK , melting into earth , UNK his frame had been taken '' STOP
START these conditions man did not keep , and thus he became UNK ; ; STOP
START yet he did not stop being human as a result STOP
START there is no justification for UNK the random statements of irenaeus about the image of god beyond this , nor for reading into his UNK usage the later theological distinction between the image of god ( humanity ) and the UNK of god ( immortality ) STOP
START man was created with the capacity for immortality , but the UNK promise of immortality in exchange for UNK cost adam his immortality STOP
START he was , in the words of irenaeus , `` UNK by another under the UNK of immortality '' STOP
START the true way to immortality lay through UNK , but man did not believe this STOP
START `` eve was UNK ; ; STOP
START for she did not UNK when as yet she was a virgin STOP
START and even as she , having indeed a husband , adam , but being nevertheless as yet a virgin , having become UNK , was made the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human race ; ; STOP
START so also did mary , having a man UNK ( to her ) , and being nevertheless a virgin , by UNK UNK , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human race '' STOP
START because he UNK the primitive state of man as one of mere UNK or capacity and believes that adam and eve were created as children , irenaeus often seems inclined to UNK their UNK as being `` due , no doubt , to UNK , but still UNK '' STOP
START his interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end UNK him to draw these UNK between the virgin eve and the virgin mary STOP
START that UNK affects his picture of man's UNK too ; ; STOP
START for as it was christ , the word of god , who came to UNK man , so it was UNK to the word of god in the beginning that brought death into the world , and all our UNK STOP
START with this act of UNK , and not with the UNK of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the UNK of history , UNK from the created capacity for immortality to an UNK UNK STOP
START at the UNK of that circuit is death STOP
START `` along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death , because they did eat in UNK ; ; STOP
START and UNK to god UNK death STOP
START UNK , as they became UNK to death , from that ( moment ) they were UNK over to it '' STOP
START this leads irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that adam and eve died on the same day that they UNK , namely , on a friday , as a parallel to the death of christ on good friday ; ; STOP
START he sees a parallel also to the jewish day of preparation for the UNK STOP
START in any case , though they had been promised immortality if they UNK of the tree , they obtained UNK instead STOP
START the wages of sin is death STOP
START man's life , originally shaped for immortality and for UNK with god , must now be UNK to the shape of death STOP
START nevertheless , even at the UNK of the circuit the UNK of history belongs to god , and he still rules STOP
START even death , therefore , has a UNK as well as a UNK function STOP
START `` UNK also he ( god ) drove him ( man ) out of UNK , and removed him far from the tree of life , not because he UNK him the tree of life , as some venture to assert , but because he UNK him , ( and did not desire ) that he should continue a UNK for ever , nor that the sin which surrounded him should be UNK , and evil UNK and UNK STOP
START but he set a bound to his ( state of ) sin , by UNK death , and thus causing sin to cease , putting an end to it by the UNK of the flesh , which should take place in the earth , so that man , UNK at length to live in sin , and UNK to it , might live to god '' STOP
START this idea , which occurs in both UNK and UNK , UNK especially well into the scheme of UNK theology ; ; STOP
START for it UNK the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in christ STOP
START as man can live only by UNK , so it was only by his UNK that christ could bring many to life STOP
START it is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in irenaeus than the idea of sin is STOP
START this applies to his picture of adam STOP
START it is UNK out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next STOP
START it becomes most evident in his description of christ as the second adam , who does indeed come to destroy sin , but whose work UNK in the achievement of immortality STOP
START this emphasis upon death rather than sin as man's fundamental problem irenaeus shares with many early UNK , especially the UNK ones STOP
START they speak of the work of christ as the UNK of UNK , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) UNK from time and history STOP
START death UNK man of his sin , but it UNK him also of his UNK STOP
START it represents a punishment that he knows he UNK , but it also UNK most UNK that he lives his life within the process of time STOP
START these two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated , but they dare not be confused or identified STOP
START the repeated efforts in christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated STOP
START such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether adam was created capable of growing old and then older and then still older , in short , whether UNK life was intended to be part of the process of time STOP
START if it was , then it must have been god's intention to UNK him at a certain point from time to UNK STOP
START one night , so some of these theories run , adam would have fallen UNK , much as he fell UNK for the creation of eve ; ; STOP
START and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal STOP
START the UNK of these theories over the UNK of death is an illustration of the UNK that death cannot be only a punishment , for some UNK seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change STOP
START on the other hand , christian faith knows that death is more than the natural UNK of UNK existence STOP
START it is the wages of sin , and its UNK is the law STOP
START if this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural UNK , the conclusion seems inevitable that UNK existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the creator STOP
START this seems to have been the conclusion to which UNK was forced STOP
START if death receives more than its share of attention from the UNK and if sin receives less than its share , the gift of the life eternal through christ begins to look like the UNK appointed means of UNK from UNK , i.e, created , existence STOP
START such an interpretation of death UNK UNK the christian view of creation ; ; STOP
START for it UNK salvation from , not salvation in , time and history STOP
START because christianity UNK not only salvation in history , but salvation by the history of christ , such an interpretation of death would require a UNK UNK of the christian understanding of the work of christ STOP
START furthermore , as an UNK to UNK thinking , it UNK is fair to admit that any UNK has a constitutional right to UNK to accept persons it UNK STOP
START the UNK clergy were an exclusive club of UNK UNK -- as the term was then understood in the back bay -- and parker was UNK not a gentleman , either in theology or in UNK STOP
START UNK UNK UNK , an UNK representative of the UNK , UNK himself UNK to the issue in UNK , UNK that parker should not be UNK or UNK and that in this republic no power to UNK him by force could exist STOP
START even so , UNK UNK argued , the association could UNK decide that parker `` should not be encouraged nor UNK in UNK his opinions by those who differ from him in regard to their UNK '' STOP
START we today are not entitled to UNK honest men who believed parker to be UNK UNK and who UNK their UNK against his demand to UNK the minds of their congregations STOP
START one can even argue -- though this is a UNK matter -- that every justification existed for their returning the public UNK to the first church , and so to UNK it , rather than let parker use it as a UNK board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it STOP
START finally , it did seem clear as day to these UNK , as UNK son explained in the UNK of his father , they had always contended for the UNK of their claim to the title of christians STOP
START their demand against the UNK UNK for intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow `` free inquiry '' to the extreme of UNK christianity a `` natural '' religion STOP
START grant all this -- still , when modern UNK and the harvard UNK school recall with humorous affection the UNK parker UNK upon them , or else argue that after all parker received the treatment he invited , they UNK an uneasy conscience STOP
START whenever new england liberalism is reminded of the dramatic UNK of parker and the UNK on january 23 , UNK -- while it may UNK the privilege of chandler UNK to demand that parker leave the association , while it may UNK that UNK had every warrant for stating , `` the difference between UNK and UNK is a difference in christianity ; ; STOP
START the difference between UNK and the association is a difference between no christianity and christianity '' -- despite these supposed UNK UNK , the modern liberal UNK repeatedly a UNK of relief , of positive UNK , that the association never quite brought itself UNK to UNK parker STOP
START had it done so , the UNK on its UNK would have remained UNK , nor could the harvard UNK school UNK today to honor UNK UNK other than by getting down on its collective knees and UNK `` UNK '' STOP
START UNK for UNK , then , the boston association did not actually command parker to leave the room , though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an UNK UNK STOP
START fortunately , the honor of the UNK can UNK that UNK UNK defended UNK UNK , as did also UNK and chandler UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK parker broke down into UNK of UNK and rushed out of the room , though not out of the fellowship STOP
START in the hall , after UNK , UNK took him UNK by the hand and UNK parker to visit him -- UNK our UNK UNK again burst into tears STOP
START all this near tragedy , which to us UNK on UNK , UNK us to tell the story over and over again , always UNK ourselves with a UNK of UNK STOP
START it was indeed a near thing , but somehow the inherent UNK of new england ( which we UNK ) did UNK STOP
START parker was never UNK STOP
START to the extent that he was UNK or even UNK , we UNK ourselves by saying he asked for it STOP
START yet , even after all these UNK , the conscience of christian UNK is still not laid to rest , any more than is the conscience of harvard university for having done the UNK UNK for its UNK of ralph UNK UNK the UNK school address of UNK its hall of philosophy after him STOP
START in both cases the UNK fact remains : liberalism gave birth to two brilliant UNK , both legitimate UNK of its UNK , and when brought to the test , it UNK UNK STOP
START suppose they both had UNK into UNK which their colleagues thought UNK : is this the way UNK settle frank differences of opinion ? ? STOP
START is it after all possible that no matter how the liberals UNK their confidence in human dignity they are exposed to a UNK of fear more UNK than any conservative has ever to worry about ? ? STOP
START however , there is a crucial difference between the two UNK STOP
START UNK UNK the problem by UNK it aside , or rather by leaving it behind him : he walked out of the UNK UNK , so that it could UNK the UNK of his UNK , preserve its UNK and eventually UNK him UNK UNK STOP
START parker insisted upon not UNK , even when the majority wanted him to UNK , upon UNK the fellowship to throw him out STOP
START hence he was in his UNK , as is the memory of him UNK , a UNK within the liberal sensitivity STOP
START he still points an UNK finger at all of us , telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his UNK STOP
START actually , the dispute between parker and the society of his time , both UNK and social , was a real one , a bitter one STOP
START it cannot be UNK over by now UNK his UNK as delightful UNK of UNK or by UNK calling for a UNK of the justice of the UNK to him STOP
START the fact is UNK : that liberal world of UNK boston was UNK , UNK UNK , UNK , afraid of the logical consequences of its own UNK UNK into UNK , and quite prepared to UNK to UNK UNK when its UNK foundations were threatened STOP
START parker , along with UNK and charles UNK , showed a magnificent moral UNK when facing UNK UNK in defense of the mexican war and slavery STOP
START nevertheless , we can find reasons for UNK even the UNK of the UNK ; ; STOP
START their passions were genuine , and the division between them and the UNK is UNK STOP
START but parker as the UNK minister within the pale of a church which had UNK itself the UNK of UNK UNK a different problem , which is not to be resolved by holding him up as the UNK of freedom STOP
START even though his theological UNK have become , to us , UNK , the fundamental UNK he UNK is very much with us STOP
START it has been UNK UNK , but i may here put it thus : at what point do the UNK find themselves obliged to become UNK ? ? STOP
START and then , as they become aware that they have reached the end of their patience , what do they , to their UNK , learn for the first time about themselves ? ? STOP
START there can be no doubt , the boston of that era could be UNK UNK in UNK its UNK of behavior STOP
START the gentle UNK , UNK by all UNK , orthodox or UNK , wrote to a friend in UNK that among its many UNK boston did not UNK in a UNK spirit , that the UNK of opinion UNK UNK of judgment and action : `` no city in the world is governed so little by a police , and so much by mutual UNK and what is called public sentiment STOP
START we stand more in UNK of one another than most people STOP
START opinion is less individual or runs more into masses , and often rules with a UNK of iron '' STOP
START even more UNK , and with the insight of a genius , UNK added -- remember , this is UNK , not parker ! ! STOP
START -- that should a minister in boston trust himself to his heart , should he `` speak without book , and consequently break some law of speech , or be UNK into some UNK UNK , he should find little mercy '' STOP
START UNK wrote this -- in a letter ! ! STOP
START i think it fair to say that he never quite reached such UNK in his UNK STOP
START but UNK parker , UNK his mission to the UNK , UNK as the minister of a `` UNK congregational church '' which bore no UNK to the congregational UNK UNK from the UNK ( among which were still the UNK churches ) , made explicit from the beginning that the conflict between him and the UNK society was not something which could be UNK into a UNK difference about UNK UNK STOP
START because he spoke openly with what UNK had UNK someone might -- with UNK UNK -- parker UNK UNK further UNK that he who committed this UNK of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals were disposed to allow to UNK who appeared to them UNK STOP
START an UNK liberalism proved itself UNK an institution , and only within those defined limits a license STOP
START by UNK ourselves of these factors in the situation , we should , i am sure , come to a fresh realization , however painful it be , that the battle between parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest STOP
START he UNK the citizens in language of so little UNK that they had to respond with , at the least , UNK STOP
START what otherwise could `` the lawyer , doctor , minister , the men of science and letters '' do when told that they had `` become the UNK and UNK and the three UNK who stood before the golden UNK of the merchant , and continually UNK , ' holy , holy , holy is the UNK dollar ' `` ? ? STOP
START nor , when we UNK how sensitive were the emotions of the old UNK stock in regard to the recent UNK of UNK , should we be UNK that their thin UNK were UNK into a white line of UNK as parker UNK at them thus : `` talk about the catholics voting as the UNK tells ! ! STOP
START UNK the catholics for it ! ! STOP
START you and i do the same thing STOP
START there are a great many UNK who have never had a cross on their UNK , nor a UNK on their head , who appeal not to the authority of the pope at rome , but to the UNK dollar , a pope much UNK home STOP
START boston has been controlled by a few UNK , lawyers and other managers , who told the editors what to say and the UNK what to think '' STOP
START this was war STOP
START parker meant business STOP
START and he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended them : `` even the UNK churches have caught the UNK , and are worse than those who UNK them '' -- which implied that they were very bad indeed STOP
START it was `` duty '' he said that his parents had given him as a rule -- beyond even the love that UNK his being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied -- and it was duty he would perform , though it cost him UNK pain and UNK him by the age of fifty STOP
START parker could UNK -- and he UNK UNK often and on the UNK UNK -- but the psychology of those tears was entirely compatible with a UNK readiness to UNK his UNK STOP
START `` if it gave me pleasure to say hard things '' , he wrote , `` i would shut up forever '' STOP
START we have to tell ourselves that when parker spoke in this vein , he believed what he said , because he could continue , `` but the truth , which cost me bitter tears to say , i must speak , though it cost other tears UNK than fire '' STOP
START because he UNK UNK his own tears , and UNK himself up as a living sacrifice to the UNK conscience of new england , he was not disturbed by the UNK he worked in other people's UNK STOP
START our UNK to capture even a UNK sense of how UNK was the fight is UNK by our UNK to the very issue which in the boston of UNK seemed to be the central hope of its christian survival , that of the literal , UNK UNK of the UNK as reported in the four UNK STOP
START it is UNK to ask why we are no longer disturbed if UNK , UNK the UNK UNK , UNK UNK that it is of no importance whether or not christ transformed the water into wine at eleven UNK the third of august , UNK STOP
START we have no answer as to why we are not UNK STOP
START so we are the more prepared to give parker the credit for having taken the right side in an UNK controversy , to UNK his courage , and to pass on , UNK UNK both him and the entire UNK STOP
START we have not the UNK , or the patience , or the skill , to UNK what was working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the harvard UNK school who would UNK the UNK to UNK his most formidable UNK , the UNK UNK UNK , by saying that , while he believed jesus `` like other religious teachers '' , worked UNK , `` i see not how a UNK UNK a doctrine '' STOP
START i have , within the past fifty years , come out of all uncertainty into a faith which is a UNK conviction of the truth and about which i have not a UNK of doubt STOP
START it has been my lot all through life to associate with UNK scientists and at times to discuss with them the UNK and most vital of all questions , the nature of the hope of a life beyond this STOP
START i have also constantly engaged in scientific work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science as well as in the religions in the world STOP
START in an UNK , yet in a very real sense , i have followed the developments of UNK , UNK , astronomy , UNK , and UNK with a UNK appreciation of the advances being made in these fields STOP
START at one time i became disturbed in the faith in which i had grown up by the apparent UNK being made upon both old and new UNK by a `` higher criticism '' of the bible , to UNK which i felt the need of a better knowledge of UNK and of UNK , for it seemed to me that to pull out some of the UNK of our faith was to UNK the entire structure STOP
START UNK thus UNK left me UNK for a while and , like some higher critical friends , trying to continue to use the bible as the word of god while at the same time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of UNK and UNK : attempting to bridge the UNK between an older , UNK , UNK generation and a critical , UNK , UNK race STOP
START although still aware of a great light and UNK of UNK in the book , i stood outside UNK in the cold STOP
START in one thing the higher critics , like the UNK , however , UNK themselves , in UNK that the UNK of john was not written in UNK time but well after the first century , perhaps as late as UNK UNK STOP
START now , if any part of the bible is UNK the very word of god speaking through his servant , it is UNK UNK STOP
START to ask me to believe that so UNK UNK a book was written long after all the events by some UNK UNK , and was not inspired directly by the spirit of god , is asking me to accept a UNK far greater than any of those recorded in the bible STOP
START here i took my leave of my learned friends to step out on another path , to which we might give the modern name of UNK , or the thing that works STOP
START test it , try it , and if it works , accept it as a UNK principle STOP
START so , i put my bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself , and then tested it to see how it worked STOP
START as a short , possibly not the best method , i looked up `` word '' in the UNK and noted that the bible claims from UNK 1 to UNK 22 to be god's personal message to man STOP
START the next traditional step then was to accept it as the UNK UNK of the christian faith just as one would accept a UNK on any UNK `` science '' , and i submitted to its conditions according to christ's UNK and promise that , `` if any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of god , or whether i speak of myself '' ( john 7 : 17 ) STOP
START the outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance of the bible as the word of god inspired in a sense utterly different from any merely human book , and with it the acceptance of our lord jesus christ as the only UNK son of god , son of man by the virgin mary , the UNK of the world STOP
START i believe , therefore , that we are without exception UNK , by nature UNK from god , and that jesus christ , the son of god , came to earth , the representative head of a new race , to die upon the cross and pay the UNK of the sin of the world , and that he who thus receives christ as his personal UNK is `` born again '' UNK , with new UNK , UNK , and UNK , UNK to live and grow in his UNK forever STOP
START nor can any man save himself by good works or by a UNK `` moral life '' , although such works are the natural fruits and UNK of a saving faith already received and naturally expressing itself through such UNK STOP
START i now ever look for christ according to his UNK and those of the old testament as well , to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to UNK in UNK over the whole earth STOP
START to state fully what the bible means as my daily spiritual food is as UNK and difficult as to UNK the reasons for UNK my nearest and UNK relatives and friends STOP
START the bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as bread is food for the body STOP
START again , as faith reveals god my father and christ my UNK , i follow without question where he leads me daily by his spirit of love , wisdom , power and prayer STOP
START i place his UNK and his UNK above every UNK probability , UNK UNK convictions and holding the wisdom of man as UNK when opposed to him STOP
START i UNK no limits to a faith UNK in god and christ , who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge , and UNK to trust him even though called to stand alone before the world STOP
START our UNK UNK with its implied promise to all is , `` come and see '' STOP
START i stood at the UNK of my patient one day and UNK a very sick man in terrible pain STOP
START as i UNK to his needs , i noticed that his face was UNK in spite of his suffering and i learned that he was UNK not only in the skill of his doctor and UNK but also the lord STOP
START in his heart he had that peace of which the lord spoke when he said , `` peace i leave with you , my peace i give UNK you : not as the world UNK , give i UNK you STOP
START let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid '' STOP
START what a joy to realize that we , too , can claim this promise UNK by the lord during his UNK ministry to a group of men who were very dear to him STOP
START he was about to leave them , to UNK from this world , and return to his father in heaven STOP
START before he left them he promised that his peace would be their portion to UNK in their hearts and minds STOP
START i UNK god for the privilege of being a UNK who has that peace through faith in the lord jesus christ STOP
START it makes my work a great deal easier to be able to UNK for the UNK guidance while UNK to the physical needs of my patients STOP
START how often have i looked to jesus when entering the sick room , asking for his presence and help in my professional duties as i give my talents not only as the world UNK but as one who UNK the UNK and his creatures STOP
START looking UNK god , the UNK UNK wrote these UNK words almost three thousand years ago : `` UNK UNK keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee : because he UNK in thee '' STOP
START are you UNK for peace in your heart ? ? STOP
START such a calm and UNK peace can be UNK STOP
START as only a member of the family can share in the UNK UNK of the family , likewise one must belong to the family of god in order to receive the benefits that are promised to those who are his own STOP
START perhaps you are not his child STOP
START perhaps you do not know if you belong to him STOP
START you may know that you are in god's family and be just as sure of it as you are that you belong to the family of your UNK father STOP
START `` god so loved the world , that he gave his only UNK son , that UNK UNK in him should not UNK , but have UNK life '' , and `` as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of god , even to them that believe on his name '' STOP
START it is to those who believe on his name and belong to him that he gives his peace ; ; STOP
START not that empty peace the world offers , but a deep , UNK peace which nothing can destroy STOP
START why not open your heart to the lord jesus christ now , accept him as your UNK and let him fill you with peace that only he can give STOP

START no amount of religious UNK or even UNK a church will UNK the UNK of your `` inner '' space STOP

START because your soul was made to be filled with god himself , not religious functions `` about '' him STOP

START ( UNK 27 : 1 ) STOP
START a certain teacher scheduled a `` fear party '' for her fourth grade pupils STOP
START it was a session at which all the UNK were told to express their fears , to get them out in the open where they could talk about them freely STOP
START the teacher thought it was so successful that she UNK : `` wouldn't it be helpful to all age groups if they could participate in a similar UNK of their fears and UNK '' ? ? STOP

START they are ' worry UNK STOP
START yet they keep running from one UNK to another , largely to get a willing ear who will listen to their parade of UNK STOP
START one of the most UNK things you could schedule in your church would thus be a group UNK where people could admit of their inner tensions '' STOP
START we are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to deal with the problem of fear these days STOP
START it must be getting more serious STOP
START people are giving their doctors a hard time STOP
START one doctor made a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their UNK , and he reported that UNK of them UNK about things that never happened ; ; STOP
START UNK of them UNK about past UNK which were completely beyond their control ; ; STOP
START UNK of them UNK about their health , although their UNK were imaginary ; ; STOP
START UNK of them UNK about their friends , neighbors , and relatives , most of whom were quite capable of taking care of themselves STOP
START only UNK of the UNK had behind them real causes which demanded attention STOP
START well , most of our fears may be UNK , but after you discover that fact , you have something else to worry about : why then do we have these fears ? ? STOP
START what is the real cause of them ? ? STOP
START what is there about us that makes us so anxious ? ? STOP
START look at the things we do to escape our fears and to forget our UNK STOP
START we spend millions of dollars every year on UNK UNK and UNK STOP
START we spend UNK of dollars at the race UNK , and more UNK on other forms of UNK STOP
START we spend UNK of dollars on liquor , and many more UNK on various forms of UNK entertainment STOP
START we UNK tons of UNK and UNK and sleeping UNK in order to get a UNK relief from the tensions that are UNK us apart STOP
START a UNK from a more peaceful country across the sea was taken to one of our UNK parks , and after he had seen it all , he said to a friend : `` you must be a very sad people '' STOP
START `` sad '' was not the right word , of course STOP
START he should have said `` UNK '' , for that's what we are STOP
START and that's worse than sad STOP
START watch people UNK to UNK houses , cocktail UNK , and night UNK that UNK continuous entertainment , which means an UNK flow of noise and UNK by paid UNK who are supposed to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give men a few hours of UNK UNK -- watch them and you can tell that many of them are running away from something STOP
START in one of his writings UNK speaks of this UNK for UNK as being a sign of misery and fear which man cannot UNK without such UNK STOP
START yes , and as tension UNK in this world , fear is increasing STOP
START does that explain why there is now such a big UNK in the UNK shelter business ? ? STOP
START we have so many new things to fear in this age of nuclear weapons , UNK things which are too UNK to UNK STOP
START i doubt that `` fear parties '' and `` group UNK '' will help very much STOP
START suppose we do get our fears out in the open , what then ? ? STOP
START isn't that where most of them are already -- right out on the front page of our newspapers ? ? STOP
START maybe we are talking about them too much STOP
START the question is : what are we going to do about them ? ? STOP
START meanwhile , the enemy will UNK on our fears , if he can STOP
START UNK did just that 23 years ago , building up tensions that first led to a UNK and then to a world war STOP
START the fear of war can make us either too weak to stand and too willing to UNK , or too UNK and too UNK to UNK for peace as long as there is any chance to UNK STOP
START it is said that fear in human beings produces an UNK that UNK animals to attack STOP
START it could have the same effect on communists STOP
START the president of the united states has said : `` we will never UNK out of fear , and we will never fear to UNK '' STOP
START that is a sound position , but it is important that moscow shall recognize it not merely as the word of a president but as the mind of a free people who are not afraid STOP
START and that's another reason why it is UNK for us these days to UNK our fears , to develop the UNK that UNK peace STOP
START turning to the word of god , we find the only sure way to do that STOP
START in UNK 27 : 1 you read those beautiful words which you must have in your heart if you are to master the fears that UNK you , or to drive them out if they have you in their UNK : `` the lord is my light and my salvation ; ; STOP
START whom shall i fear ? ? STOP
START the lord is the strength of my life ; ; STOP
START of whom shall i be afraid '' ? ? STOP
START well , you say , those are beautiful words all right , but it was easy for the UNK to sing them in his day STOP
START he didn't live in a world of UNK UNK like ours STOP
START he didn't know anything about the problems we face today STOP
START no ? ? STOP
START read the next two UNK : `` when the UNK , even mine enemies and my UNK , came upon me to eat up my flesh , they UNK and fell STOP
START though an host should UNK against me , my heart shall not fear : though war should rise against me , in this will i be UNK '' STOP
START that is almost a perfect description of the UNK in which we find ourselves today , isn't it ? ? STOP
START our enemy is also threatening to UNK us STOP
START he has already UNK huge areas of the world , putting men behind concrete walls and iron UNK and UNK wire , reducing them to slavery , UNK UNK not only their bodies but their souls , and shooting them to death if they try to escape their prison STOP
START yes indeed , we too can see a UNK host of UNK UNK against us STOP
START what a terrible thing , that `` UNK wall '' in berlin ! ! STOP
START a man with a baby in his arms stood there UNK for his wife who is on the other side with the rest of the family STOP
START another man tried to UNK across the river from the east to the west , but was shot and killed STOP
START a middle UNK woman opened a window on the third floor of her house which was behind the wall , she UNK out a few UNK and then UNK ; ; STOP
START she was UNK UNK STOP
START the entrance to a church has been UNK up , so that the congregation , most of which is in the western sector , cannot worship god there UNK STOP
START practically everybody in berlin has relatives and friends that live in the opposite part of the city STOP
START people stand at the wall giving UNK to their feelings , UNK , UNK it with their UNK , UNK for loved ones STOP
START but the enemy answers them from UNK that UNK out communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible UNK STOP
START there is only one escape left , a tragic one , and too many people are taking it : UNK STOP
START the normal rate of UNK in east berlin was one a day , but since the UNK was closed on august 13 it has UNK to 25 a day ! ! STOP
START these things may be happening many miles away from us but really they are right next door STOP
START we are all involved in them , deeply involved STOP
START and nobody knows what comes next STOP
START we live from crisis to crisis STOP
START and there is only one way for a man to UNK his fears in such a world STOP
START he must learn to say with true faith what the UNK said in a similar world : `` the lord is my light and my salvation ; ; STOP
START whom shall i fear ? ? STOP
START the lord is the strength of my life ; ; STOP
START of whom shall i be afraid '' ? ? STOP
START notice that this man had a UNK conception of god which is the secret of his faith STOP
START first , `` the lord is my light '' STOP
START he lived in a very dark world , but he was not in the dark STOP
START the same god who called this world into being when he said : `` let there be light '' ! ! STOP
START -- those were his very first creative words -- he began the world with light -- this god still gives light to a world which man has UNK into darkness STOP
START for those who put their trust in him he still says every day again : `` let there be light '' ! ! STOP
START and there is light ! ! STOP
START in fact , he came into this world himself , in the person of his son , jesus christ , who stood here amid the darkness of human sin and said : `` i am the light of the world : he that UNK me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life '' STOP
START the UNK could say that god was his light even though he could only UNK the coming of christ STOP
START he lived in the UNK ; ; STOP
START he could only see the light coming over the horizon STOP
START we live in the bright UNK of that great event ; ; STOP
START for us it is a fact in history STOP
START why should we not have the same faith , and an even greater experience of the light which it gives ? ? STOP
START this is the faith that moved the UNK to add his second conception of god : `` the lord is my salvation '' STOP
START he knew that his god would save him from his enemies because he had saved him from his UNK STOP
START if god could do that , he could do anything STOP
START the enemies at his gate , threatening to eat up his flesh , were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul STOP
START and god had UNK that one by his grace ! ! STOP
START so why worry about all the others ? ? STOP
START the UNK paul said the same thing in the language and faith of the new testament : `` he that UNK not his own son , but delivered him up for us all , how shall he not with him freely give us all things ? ? STOP
START if god be for us , who can be against us ? ? STOP
START who shall separate us from the love of christ ? ? STOP
START shall UNK , or distress , or UNK , or UNK , or UNK , or UNK , or UNK '' ? ? STOP
START ( UNK 31 , UNK , UNK ) STOP
START salvation ! ! STOP
START this is the key to the UNK of fear STOP
START this gets down to the heart of our problem , for it UNK us with god , whom we fear most of all because we have UNK against him STOP
START when that fear has been removed by faith in jesus christ , when we know that he is our UNK , that he has paid our UNK with his blood , that he has met the demands of god's justice and thus has turned his UNK away -- when we know that , we have peace with god in our hearts ; ; STOP
START and then , with this god on our side , we can face the whole world without fear STOP
START and so the UNK gives us one more picture of god : `` the lord is the strength of my life '' STOP
START the word is really `` UNK '' STOP
START it UNK those words of another UNK : `` god is our UNK and strength , a very present help in trouble STOP
START therefore will not we fear , though the earth be removed , and though the mountains be carried into the UNK of the sea come , UNK the works of the lord , what UNK he UNK made in the earth STOP
START but , again , we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until the close of the UNK century UNK when an UNK UNK , UNK UNK UNK ( UNK ) is said to have discussed the magic square of three STOP
START thus , while it remains possible that the UNK and the UNK may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the chinese did , more definite evidence will have to turn up from the middle east or the classical world before china can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years STOP
START 2 STOP
START the `` lo shu '' square as an expression of UNK STOP
START the concept of the middle kingdom at peace , strong and united under a UNK UNK , which had been only a UNK ideal in the time of the UNK states , was finally realized by the establishment of a chinese empire under the UNK UNK ( UNK UNK STOP
START but this was only accomplished by excessive UNK and UNK of UNK UNK STOP
START among the many severe measures taken by the first emperor , UNK UNK , in his efforts to insure the continuation of this UNK national unity , was the burning of the books in UNK UNK with the expressed intention of UNK possible sources for UNK thinking ; ; STOP
START but , as he had a special UNK for magic and UNK , he ordered that books on these subjects should be UNK STOP
START many of the latter were destroyed in their turn , during the burning of the vast UNK palace some ten years later ; ; STOP
START yet some must have UNK , because the old interest in number UNK , UNK , and magic UNK on into the UNK UNK , which succeeded in UNK china and keeping it together for a longer period ( from UNK UNK UNK ) STOP
START in fact , during the first century UNK an extensive literature UNK up devoted to these subjects , finding its typical expression in the so-called `` UNK books '' , a number of which were specifically devoted to the lo shu and related numerical UNK , especially in connection with UNK STOP
START however , the UNK books were also destroyed in a series of orthodox UNK UNK which UNK in a final UNK in UNK STOP
START after all this destruction of old literature , it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the lo shu , which was already UNK UNK STOP
START but , in spite of all this , enough evidence remains to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object of a rather extensive UNK -- or series of UNK -- reaching UNK expression in the UNK period STOP
START although modern scholars have expressed surprise that `` the simple magic square of three '' , a mere `` mathematical UNK '' , was able to UNK a considerable influence on the minds and UNK of the UNK chinese for so many centuries , they could have found most of the answers right within the square itself STOP
START but , up to now , no one has attempted to UNK its inherent mathematical properties , or the numerical significance of its numbers -- UNK or in combination -- and then tried to consider these in the light of old chinese UNK concepts STOP
START such an analysis UNK reveals why the middle number of the lo shu , 5 , was so UNK significant for the chinese ever since the earliest UNK that they had a knowledge of this UNK STOP
START the importance of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers -- quite apart from any UNK considerations , which is to say , any symbolic meaning UNK assigned to it STOP
START indeed , UNK speaking , it was both UNK and UNK the most important number in the entire UNK STOP
START if one takes the middle number , 5 , and UNK it by 3 ( the base number of the magic square of three ) , the result is 15 , which is also the constant sum of all the rows , columns , and two main UNK STOP
START then , if the middle number is UNK to its greatest potential in terms of this square , through UNK it by the highest number , 9 ( which is the square of the base number ) , the result is UNK ; ; STOP
START and the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square , by which all the other numbers are UNK and in which they may be said to be absorbed STOP
START furthermore , the middle number of the lo shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers , by reason of its central position ; ; STOP
START it is also their mathematical mean , since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair , all of which equal 10 STOP
START in fact , the UNK balance of these pairs , and their subtle equilibrium , would have had special meaning in the minds of the old chinese STOP
START for they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female , UNK the two groups with the yang and UNK principles in nature ; ; STOP
START and in this square , the respective pairs made up of large and small odd ( yang ) numbers , and those composed of large and small even ( UNK ) numbers , were all equal to each other STOP
START thus all differences were UNK , and all UNK UNK , in a realm of no distinction , and the UNK balance of the lo shu square could effectively UNK the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis STOP
START the tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the lo shu square -- for purely mathematical reasons -- and the fact that this number so UNK UNK the heart and center of the universe , could well explain why the old chinese seem to have so UNK the number 5 , and why they put so much stress on the concept of UNK STOP
START these UNK UNK seem to have reached their height in the UNK UNK STOP
START the existing UNK for UNK must have been still further UNK toward the close of the second century UNK when the UNK emperor UNK UNK ordered the UNK color changed to yellow -- which UNK the center among the traditional five directions -- and took 5 as the UNK number , UNK that he would thus place himself , his UNK family , and the nation under the most UNK influences STOP
START his immediate motive for doing this may not have been directly inspired by the lo shu , but this measure must inevitably have increased the existing beliefs in the UNK UNK STOP
START after this time , UNK on the UNK UNK UNK , as well as other writings , emphasized the UNK of keeping one's self at the center of the universe , where cosmic forces were strongest STOP
START later , we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too literally STOP
START all this emphasis on UNK and on the number 5 as a symbolic expression of the center , which seems to have begun as far back as 400 UNK also may UNK have led to the development of the UNK school and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five STOP
START we find , for example , such UNK as the five ancient UNK , the five sacred mountains , the five directions ( with center ) , the five UNK , five colors , five UNK , five UNK , five musical notes , five UNK functions , five UNK , and many others STOP
START this trend has often been UNK to the UNK of the five elements itself , as though they had served as the base for all the rest ; ; STOP
START but why did the old chinese UNK five elements , when the ancient near east -- which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence in human life and activities -- recognized only four ? ? STOP
START and why did the chinese suddenly begin to talk about the five directions , when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four ? ? STOP
START obviously , something suddenly caused them to start thinking in terms of UNK , and that may have been the UNK of the lo shu STOP
START this whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on chinese thinking STOP
START whereas the primary meanings of the lo shu UNK seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties -- and we shall see that even its secondary meanings UNK on some mathematical bases -- the UNK desire to place everything into categories of UNK led to other UNK based on other numbers , until an UNK emphasis on mere UNK UNK chinese thought STOP
START scholars made UNK sets of as many things as possible in nature , or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things , in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as UNK UNK , and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to UNK UNK thought in china for many centuries STOP
START 3 STOP
START UNK and yang in the `` lo shu '' square STOP
START although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the lo shu , and the UNK of all the other numbers to it , might seem enough to account for the deep UNK which the lo shu held for the old chinese UNK , this was actually only a beginning of UNK STOP
START for the lo shu square was a remarkably complete UNK of most of the chief religious and philosophical ideas of its time STOP
START as such , one cannot fully understand the thought of the UNK and UNK periods without knowing the meanings inherent in the lo shu ; ; STOP
START but , UNK , one cannot begin to understand the lo shu without knowing something about the world view of the old chinese , which they felt they saw expressed in it STOP
START the chinese world view during the UNK UNK , when the lo shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity , was based in large part on the UNK of the UNK and UNK school , which was UNK founded by UNK UNK STOP
START according to this doctrine , the universe was ruled by heaven , UNK -- as a natural force , or in the UNK of a supreme UNK -- governing all things by means of a process called the UNK , which can be roughly interpreted as `` the order of the universe '' or `` the universal way '' STOP
START heaven , acting through the UNK , expressed itself by means of the UNK of two basic principles , the UNK and the yang STOP
START the yang , or male principle , was the source of light , heat , and dynamic UNK , associated with the sun ; ; STOP
START while the UNK , or female principle , UNK in darkness , cold , and quiet UNK , and was associated with the moon STOP
START together these two principles influenced all things , and in varying combinations they were present in everything STOP
START we have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being yang , while the even numbers were UNK , so that the eight outer numbers of the lo shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the UNK center STOP
START during the UNK UNK , another UNK conception was applied to the lo shu , considering the latter as a plan of ancient china STOP
START instead of UNK the nine numbers of this UNK with the traditional nine UNK , as was usually done , this UNK the odd , yang numbers with mountains ( firm and UNK , hence yang ) and the even numbers with rivers ( UNK and UNK , hence UNK ) ; ; STOP
START taking the former from the five sacred mountains of the UNK period and the latter from the principal river systems of old china STOP
START thus the middle number , 5 , represented UNK in UNK , central china ; ; STOP
START the 3 , UNK in UNK , east china ; ; STOP
START the 7 , UNK in UNK , west china ; ; STOP
START the 1 , UNK in UNK , north china ( or the mountain with the same name in neighboring UNK ) ; ; STOP
START and the 9 , UNK in UNK , which was then the south sacred mountain STOP
START for the rivers , the 4 represented the UNK , to the ( then ) UNK ; ; STOP
START the 2 , the san UNK ( three rivers ) in the ( then ) southwest ; ; STOP
START the 8 , the UNK in the UNK ; ; STOP
START and the 6 , the ( upper ) yellow river in the northwest STOP
START note that by western standards this plan was `` UNK down '' , as it put north at the bottom and south at the top , with the other directions UNK altered ; ; STOP
START but in this respect it was merely following the accepted chinese convention for all maps STOP
START the same arrangement was used when the lo shu was UNK with the nine UNK ; ; STOP
START and whenever the lo shu involved UNK UNK , it was UNK in this same fashion STOP
START few persons who join the church are UNK STOP
START they UNK desire to do the will of god STOP
START when they fall by the UNK and fail to achieve christian UNK , it is an UNK of the church STOP
START these UNK are dramatic evidence of `` UNK UNK '' , a failure to follow through STOP
START a program of lay UNK UNK can end in UNK defeat with half the new members UNK away unless practical plans and UNK efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship STOP
START the work of lay UNK UNK is not completed when all of the persons on the responsibility list have been UNK STOP
START in the average situation about one-third of those visited make commitments to christ and the church STOP
START the UNK and the membership preparation and UNK committee must follow through immediately with a carefully planned program STOP

START UNK means spiritual UNK or death STOP
START preparation for membership STOP
START churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation and UNK often keep UNK to UNK per cent of their new members UNK and active STOP
START this is the answer to the problem of `` membership UNK '' STOP
START it is important that persons UNK to UNK with the church be prepared for this experience so that it may be meaningful and UNK significant STOP
START it is UNK and UNK to ask a person to take the sacred UNK of church membership before he has been carefully UNK concerning their implications STOP
START preparation for church membership begins immediately after the UNK is received STOP
START 1 ) STOP
START the UNK writes a personal letter to each individual , expressing his joy over the decision , UNK him of a UNK call at the earliest convenient time , and UNK the plan for membership preparation classes and membership sunday STOP
START some UNK write a letter the same night the decision is reported by the visitors STOP
START it should not be UNK later than the next day STOP
START a helpful UNK may be UNK in the letter STOP
START 2 ) STOP
START the UNK calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance conference STOP
START if possible , he should make an UNK in order that all persons involved may be present STOP
START this is not a social call STOP
START it is UNK a `` spiritual guidance conference '' STOP
START he will discuss the significance of christian UNK , the necessity of family religion and private UNK , and the importance of the membership preparation sessions STOP
START there may be problems of conduct or questions of belief which will require his counsel STOP
START each conference should be concluded naturally with prayer STOP
START a piece of UNK material , such as the upper room , may be left in each home STOP

START a minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership is necessary for adults STOP
START some churches require more STOP
START none should ask less STOP
START those who join the church need to be UNK in the faith and the meaning of christian UNK before they take the sacred UNK STOP
START they will have a greater appreciation for the church and a deeper devotion to it if membership requires something of them STOP
START many churches find the sunday school hour to be the most practical time for adult preparation classes STOP
START others meet on sunday night , at the UNK service , or for a series of four nights STOP
START some UNK have two sessions in one evening , with a UNK period between STOP
START the sessions should cover four major areas : a STOP

START c STOP
START -- duties of church membership ; ; STOP

START there is a growing conviction among UNK and church leaders that all those who come into the fellowship of the church need UNK training , including those coming by transfer of membership STOP
START george UNK writes : `` there is danger in trying to make admission to the church so easy and UNK that people will scarcely know that anything has happened '' STOP
START people appreciate experiences that demand something of them STOP
START those who transfer their membership are no exception to the rule STOP
START for most of them , it will be their first experience in membership training , since this is a recent development in many churches STOP
START those coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed STOP
START the UNK class is an UNK UNK group in which new members become UNK with one another STOP
START it provides a natural transition into the life of the local church and its organizations STOP
START reception into the church fellowship STOP
START the total process of UNK reaches the UNK when the group of new members stands before the congregation to UNK publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship of the church STOP
START this should be a high moment in their lives , a UNK experience STOP
START they should sense the tremendous significance of UNK the spiritual succession reaching back to christ our lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the UNK of the ages STOP
START every detail of the service UNK careful attention -- the UNK , the UNK , the ritual , the right hand of fellowship , the introduction to the congregation , the welcome of the congregation STOP
START this is a vital part of their spiritual growth and UNK STOP
START it will help to determine the attitude of the new members toward the church STOP
START it can mean the difference between participation and UNK , spiritual growth and decay STOP
START the worship service is the natural and logical time to receive new members into the church STOP
START the atmosphere for this UNK experience can be created most effectively through the worship experience STOP
START UNK the reception should be the climax , following the UNK STOP
START 1 ) STOP
START ask the new members to meet thirty minutes before the service to complete `` talent sheets '' and UNK cards STOP
START some denominations ask new members to sign personally the UNK membership register STOP
START provide a name card for each new member STOP
START UNK plans for the entire service STOP
START 2 ) STOP
START UNK a reserved section in the UNK where all new members may sit together STOP
START UNK may sit with them also STOP
START 3 ) STOP
START UNK UNK or fellowship friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service STOP
START 4 ) STOP
START give each new member a UNK of membership STOP
START 5 ) STOP
START UNK each new member to the congregation , asking him to face the congregation STOP
START 6 ) STOP
START lead the congregation in a response of welcome STOP
START 7 ) STOP
START have a reception for new members in the UNK or social hall immediately after the service STOP
START 8 ) STOP
START take a picture of the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the bulletin board STOP
START 9 ) STOP
START have a fellowship UNK or dinner with new members as guests STOP
START chapter 6 planning for the UNK and growth of new members STOP
START the church is `` the family of god '' STOP
START the members of the `` family '' are drawn together by a common love for christ and a UNK devotion to his kingdom STOP
START every member of the family must have a vital place in its life STOP
START this is no UNK experience ; ; STOP
START everyone is to be a UNK STOP
START yet the most difficult problem in the UNK program of UNK is right at this point -- helping new members to become UNK , growing parts of the fellowship STOP
START very easily they may be UNK and eventually join the UNK of the UNK and UNK STOP
START a study of major UNK membership statistics over a UNK period revealed the UNK fact that nearly 40 per cent of those who joined the church were lost to the church within seven years STOP
START one UNK had a membership of UNK at the beginning of the period under study , and twenty years later its membership stood at UNK -- a net growth of only UNK STOP
START yet during the same period there were UNK UNK STOP
START another major church body had UNK members and twenty years later its membership stood at UNK STOP
START during this time UNK new members were brought into the fellowship STOP
START still another UNK had UNK members twenty years ago STOP
START during this period UNK members were received , yet the net membership now is only UNK STOP
START these figures indicate that we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into membership STOP
START this problem is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the active membership UNK each year as many as they receive into the fellowship STOP
START studies of membership trends , even in some areas where population is expanding , show that numbers of churches have had little net increase , though many new members were received STOP
START something is wrong when these things happen STOP
START the local `` family of god '' has failed its new members through UNK and UNK for their spiritual welfare STOP
START basic needs STOP
START new members can become UNK , growing members STOP
START but this will not happen merely through the natural process of social life STOP
START it must be planned and carefully developed STOP
START the entire membership of the local church must be UNK to their part in this dynamic process STOP
START if the church has followed the plan of UNK of prospects and carried through a program of membership preparation as UNK earlier in this book , the process of UNK and growth will be well under way STOP
START those who enter the front door of the church UNK and with christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest STOP
START however , it is not enough to bring persons to christian UNK and train them in the meaning of christian UNK STOP
START when they UNK with the church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into effective christians STOP
START the church UNK certain things of those who become members STOP
START the new members UNK expect some things from their church family : STOP
START -- welcome into the fellowship STOP
START -- UNK christian love and understanding STOP
START -- UNK and UNK worship experiences STOP
START -- social and UNK activities STOP
START -- opportunities for christian service STOP
START -- opportunities for study of the christian faith and the bible STOP
START -- creative prayer experiences STOP
START -- guidance in christian social concerns STOP
START men need unity and they need god STOP
START care must be taken neither to UNK unity with uniformity nor god with our UNK ideas about him , but with these two UNK , the statement stands STOP
START the statement also points to a classic UNK : the more men turn toward god , who is not only in himself the UNK of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established , the more men UNK into groups and set themselves apart from one another STOP
START to be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious divisions have UNK political ones , with a resultant UNK of the human race STOP
START UNK attending the UNK of india and the establishment of the state of UNK are simply recent UNK UNK of the UNK such divisions can UNK STOP
START the words of UNK UNK come UNK to mind : `` oh how we hate one another for the love of god '' ! ! STOP
START the source of this UNK is not difficult to identify STOP
START it lies in institutions STOP
START institutions require structure , form , and definition , and these in turn UNK UNK and UNK STOP
START a completely UNK institution would be a UNK in terms ; ; STOP
START to escape this fate , it must rule some things out STOP
START for every UNK which UNK what something is , at the same time UNK -- UNK if not openly -- what that something is not STOP
START some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to UNK that we do away with institutions altogether ; ; STOP
START in the present context this amounts to the advice that while being religious may have a certain justification , we ought to UNK with churches STOP
START the suggestion is naive STOP
START man is at once a UNK animal and a UNK being STOP
START having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers UNK , he inevitably UNK forms for its expression and institutions for its UNK STOP
START to UNK that men be religious without having religious institutions is like UNK that they be learned without having schools STOP
START both UNK are possible UNK , but practically they are impossible STOP
START as much as men UNK need the unity that is UNK in god , they UNK require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him STOP
START yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at UNK with their fellows STOP
START is there any way out of the UNK ? ? STOP
START the only way that i can see is through communication STOP
START UNK communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our UNK STOP
START approached UNK , it is a high art STOP
START it is the art of relating the UNK to the infinite , of doing our best to insure that the UNK requirements of religious institutions will not UNK god's UNK of unity among men more than is UNK necessary STOP
START in a certain sense , UNK communication UNK diplomatic communication among the UNK STOP
START what are the pertinent facts UNK such communication at the present UNK of history ? ? STOP
START i shall touch on three areas : personal , national , and theological STOP
START 1 ) STOP
START by personal factors i mean those UNK in personality structure STOP
START some UNK tensions are not UNK by theological differences at all , but by the need of men to have persons they can UNK , UNK , UNK , and even hate STOP
START such needs may rise to UNK proportions STOP
START modern psychology has shown that UNK `` the UNK personality '' is `` the UNK personality '' in which UNK , UNK , suspicion , and UNK combine to provide a target for UNK so indispensable that it will be UNK if it does not exist naturally STOP
START fortunately the number of UNK UNK appears to be quite small , but it would be a mistake to think that more than a matter of degree UNK them from the rest of us STOP
START to some extent the personal UNK that UNK attempt to UNK for are to be found in all of us STOP
START UNK UNK which spring from psychological UNK are the most unfortunate of all , for they have no UNK features UNK STOP
START it is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they , rather than UNK for them , that are causing the trouble , and do everything possible to UNK the healthy UNK that will prevent the development of such UNK STOP
START 2 ) STOP
START while the personality factors that UNK UNK conflict may be UNK , nationalism is more variable STOP
START the specific instance i have in mind is the UNK version which has gained UNK only in this second half of the twentieth century STOP
START emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination , the UNK world is UNK with a nationalism that has UNK UNK STOP
START no less than UNK nations have already achieved independence since world war 2 , , and the number is growing by the year STOP
START as an obvious consequence , UNK to genuine UNK communication have grown more formidable in one important area : relations between christians and UNK in these lands STOP
START UNK alone would have been able to make these difficulties serious , for christianity is so closely tied to UNK in the minds of these people that UNK of the one has tended automatically toward the UNK of the other STOP
START actually , however , this turns out to be only part of the picture STOP
START nationalism has UNK not only the UNK of foreign religions but the UNK of native ones , some of which had been lying in UNK for centuries STOP
START the truth is that any UNK of traditional and UNK religion will serve to promote that sense of identity and UNK which these young nations very much need STOP
START UNK as these nations claim to UNK traditions and ways of life which constitute ultimate , UNK UNK for their existence , such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone UNK STOP
START all this works severely against the kind of UNK communication for which christian missions stand STOP
START UNK and UNK tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of western culture and UNK if not of direct political propaganda STOP
START the people UNK hit by this suspicion are , of course , christians on the UNK of china STOP
START but the problem UNK elsewhere STOP
START for example , in UNK and UNK many UNK argue that UNK ought to be the official state religion STOP
START in 1960 UNK UNK its UNK -- UNK christian -- schools , to the UNK of most of its UNK UNK and the UNK of its UNK roman catholics STOP
START again , india has imposed formidable UNK against the entrance of additional UNK , and UNK UNK parties are expected to seek further action against christians once the influence making for UNK due to UNK and his UNK is gone STOP
START the progressive UNK of UNK ears to the christian message is UNK in a conversation i had three years ago while flying from UNK to UNK STOP
START i was UNK next to the director of the seventh day UNK world radio program STOP
START he said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on japanese radio networks , but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them STOP
START after returning to the united states and raising the money , he discovered on getting back to japan that the hours were no longer available STOP
START it was not that they had been UNK for during the interval ; ; STOP
START they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes STOP
START it is not UNK to add on the other side that the UNK and almost UNK approach of certain UNK UNK toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed UNK to this UNK of UNK sentiment STOP
START UNK , these are the groups which have UNK or UNK their missionary efforts since world war 2 , , while the more established denominations are barely maintaining UNK UNK STOP
START although i have emphasized the UNK which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between christians and UNK in asia , the fact is that this development has also UNK the UNK between certain UNK religions themselves STOP
START the UNK of india has hardly improved relations between UNK and UNK ; ; STOP
START neither has the establishment of the state of UNK UNK harmony between UNK and jews STOP
START 3 ) STOP
START i turn finally to several theological developments STOP
START 1 STOP
START UNK UNK STOP
START the modern world has been marked by progressive UNK with claims to divine UNK for the state , whatever its political form STOP
START the american constitution was historic at this point in providing that `` congress shall make no law UNK an establishment of religion or UNK the free exercise thereof '' STOP
START one of our UNK UNK , david UNK field , has gone so far as to call this provision `` the greatest achievement ever made in the course of human history '' STOP
START the trend throughout the world's religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical validity of this constitutional UNK STOP
START UNK was created in 1947 UNK as a UNK state , but when the army took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass UNK which was directed in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think their way through to the meaning of UNK for the modern political situation STOP
START `` what is the point '' , charles adams reports the UNK as asking , `` in demanding an UNK state and society if no one , not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves , can say clearly and UNK what the nature of such a state and society is '' ? ? STOP
START the current UNK of president UNK UNK UNK is UNK secular STOP
START and while the nation was formerly named `` the UNK republic of UNK '' , it is now simply `` the republic of UNK '' STOP
START comparable trends can be noted elsewhere STOP
START the new UNK in UNK is UNK less UNK than its UNK STOP
START the religious parties in UNK have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months STOP
START during the years when UNK was passing from crisis to crisis -- the UNK campaign , the UNK of UNK of UNK UNK -- it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties STOP
START now that UNK UNK relative UNK and a reduction of tensions , the UNK are less disposed to UNK STOP
START and in this country UNK UNK UNK of the line between the UNK and secular orders during the last presidential campaign served to provide a most impressive roman catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state STOP
START the failure at that time of the puerto UNK UNK to control the UNK of their people added a ring of good sense to father UNK theological argument STOP
START everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments and religious institutions alike are too UNK and UNK -- in a word , too human -- to warrant any claim of maintaining partnership with the divine STOP
START 2 STOP
START salvation UNK STOP
START my father went as a missionary to china in a generation that responded to student UNK movement UNK who held UNK in their hands and announced to the students in their audiences how many chinese souls were going to hell each second because these students were not over there saving them STOP
START that mention of this should bring UNK to our UNK today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed STOP
START i do not mean to UNK that christians have adopted the liberal assumption , so UNK in UNK , that all religions are merely different UNK to the same UNK STOP
START UNK UNK reflects the dominant position within the world council of churches when he says , `` we must claim UNK and UNK for christ and his finished work , but that very claim UNK us to claim UNK and UNK for our understanding of it '' STOP
START UNK UNK on the christian claim is of considerable significance STOP
START the roman catholic church has UNK one of its priests , father UNK , for UNK that there is no salvation outside the visible church STOP
START in UNK this under `` salvation UNK '' i do not mean to UNK that roman catholic doctrine has changed in this area but rather that it has become UNK to the world community what that doctrine is STOP
START when they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to `` permit '' the UNK of the human race by human action , because there could not possibly be any UNK grave reason to justify such a thing , they know exactly what they mean STOP
START of course , in UNK calculation , in UNK the good directly intended and done against the evil UNK and indirectly done , no greater precision can be UNK than the subject allows STOP
START yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great , or evil UNK sufficiently grave , to warrant the destruction of mankind by man's own action STOP
START i mean , however , that the moral UNK knows what he means by `` permit '' STOP
START he is not talking in the main about probabilities , UNK and danger in general STOP
START he is talking about an action which just as UNK does an evil thing ( and is known certainly and UNK to lead to this evil result ) as it UNK does some good STOP
START he is talking about double effects , of which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other , but causes both ; ; STOP
START of which one is deliberately UNK or intended and the other not intended or not directly intended , but still both are done , while the evil effect is , with equal consciousness on the part of the agent , UNK to be among the consequences STOP
START this is what , in a technical sense , to `` only permit '' an evil result means STOP
START it means to do it and to know one is doing it , but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and UNK STOP
START of course , grave UNK may be UNK to the military action of any nation , or to the action of any leader or leaders , which for any supposed good `` permits '' , in this sense , the UNK of the human race by human action STOP
START certainly , in UNK an action which truly faced such alternatives , `` it is never possible that no world would be UNK to some UNK , and there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative '' STOP
START naturally , where one or the other of the effects of an action is UNK , this has to be taken into account STOP
START especially is this true when , because the good effect is remote and UNK while the evil is certain and grave , the action is UNK STOP
START presumably , if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be UNK , not only must the good and the evil be UNK weighed and found UNK , but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken into account STOP
START there must not only be greater good than evil UNK in view , but also greater probability of actually doing more good than UNK STOP
START if an evil which is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be UNK for by a UNK , UNK , future good , by the same UNK not every present , certain , and immediate good ( or lesser evil ) that may have to be done will be UNK by a UNK , UNK , and future evil STOP
START nevertheless , according to the traditional theory , a man begins in the UNK of action and he UNK its nature and immediate consequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences STOP
START he does not expect to be able to UNK up all the future consequences of his action STOP
START above all , he does not debate mere UNK , and therefore , if these are possibly UNK , find himself forced into UNK STOP
START he does what he can and may and must , without regarding himself as lord of the future or , on the other hand , as covered with guilt by accident or UNK consequences or by results he did not `` permit '' in the sense explained STOP
START by contrast , a good deal of nuclear UNK begins with the UNK and the probabilities , and not with the moral nature of the action to be done ; ; STOP
START and by UNK legitimate decision backward from whatever may UNK or possibly or probably result , whether by UNK doing or by accident , it finds itself driven to UNK , to UNK action in politics and UNK action in military affairs , and to the not very surprising discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly be based STOP
START UNK UNK writes , for example , that `` in terms of probability it is surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to UNK war in the near future if the present situation continues STOP
START if it continues UNK it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be made and that the UNK will begin '' STOP
START against such a UNK of human life on earth by human action , he then UNK as an alternative that we `` UNK at once with the russians and get the best terms which are available '' , that we deliberately `` UNK from comparative weakness '' STOP
START he UNK attempts to face this alternative UNK , i.e, by considering the worst possible outcome , namely , the total domination of the world by russia within a few years STOP
START this would be by far the better choice , when `` it is a question of allowing the human race to survive , possibly under the domination of a UNK which most of us UNK , or of allowing it to destroy itself in UNK and prolonged UNK '' STOP
START nevertheless , the consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere UNK qualified : it is `` a possible result , however UNK '' ; ; STOP
START `` the worst , and least probable '' result ; ; STOP
START `` if it didn't UNK mankind would still be given the opportunity of prevailing '' ; ; STOP
START for `` surely anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war '' STOP
START if we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms , then we need to UNK ourselves to the following `` simple test '' : `` have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less UNK than they are '' ? ? STOP
START thus , moral decision must be entirely UNK backward from the likely UNK ; ; STOP
START it is no longer to be formulated in terms of the nature of present action itself , its intention , and UNK effect or the thing to be done STOP
START several of the UNK to UNK , without conscious UNK to the traditional UNK with regard to the permission of evil , UNK in UNK the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made , by UNK between UNK a great evil and UNK in danger of this evil STOP
START `` it is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of UNK '' STOP
START `` i am UNK prepared to run the continued risk of ' race UNK by accident ' rather than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design STOP
START but i can only make this choice because i believe that the risk need not increase , but may be deliberately reduced '' ( by UNK against UNK or by UNK war ? ? STOP
START ) `` UNK UNK phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war , he ( UNK ) says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war '' STOP
START `` if asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility , most men will choose the latter '' STOP
START `` if UNK UNK is UNK that the choice lies between UNK and the risk of nuclear war , i think he is right STOP
START i do not accept that the choice is between UNK and the certainty of nuclear war '' STOP
START even professor UNK UNK , UNK with his son , does so in these terms : `` compared to continuing to UNK a constant risk of the destruction of the human race , all other UNK are lesser UNK STOP
START let us therefore put first things first , and make sure of UNK the human race at whatever the temporary price may be '' STOP
START UNK UNK UNK at one point that if he shared the UNK of UNK in nineteen UNK , if he believed communism was not only evil but `` also UNK evil '' , then he might `` think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world STOP
START even a nuclear UNK is a little less UNK to UNK than a race of UNK UNK UNK the earth until UNK '' STOP
START no political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature STOP
START but one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order UNK in that sense , or a UNK order in which no changes will take place in time , to be able UNK to affirm the following fact : there has never been UNK UNK in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some UNK preserved by UNK or naked force STOP
START on their way to the UNK city the children of god make use of the UNK of the UNK city and UNK their share in responsibility for its preservation STOP
START not to UNK injury and UNK and improve UNK means not simply to accept the UNK order and injustice that UNK it at the moment , but also to start down the UNK slope along which justice can find no place UNK to stand STOP
START UNK seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social UNK STOP
START `` i would far rather die after a russian occupation of this country -- by some UNK act of refusal -- than die UNK by UNK '' STOP
START would such an act of refusal be useful ? ? STOP
START he does not mean , in fact he addresses himself specifically to UNK the proposition , that `` if we took the risk of UNK , a new generation in britain would soon begin to UNK its strength in secret in order to reverse the consequences of that surrender '' STOP
START he wants to be `` UNK frank and say that these UNK would be UNK -- far , far more UNK than was the UNK revolution of 1956 '' STOP
START this is not a project for UNK the ground for limited war , by creating a UNK in one power of the world's UNK of unlimited weapons STOP
START it is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever UNK the search for it , or UNK more positive means for UNK it , in the past STOP
START `` it is no good UNK surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the UNK that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance by occupied peoples STOP
START hope for the future would lie in the natural UNK of the human race for freedom and the right to develop '' STOP
START this is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted , to the very last ; ; STOP
START it is to UNK along the UNK slope downward STOP
START the only contrary action , in the future as in the past , runs the risk of war ; ; STOP
START and , now and in the future unlike in the past , any attempt to UNK injury and to preserve any particular UNK UNK of mankind or its UNK justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will , by human action , UNK this UNK less UNK by the human race STOP
START that is why it is so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to `` permitted '' effects , and not draw back in UNK from any UNK UNK or suffer UNK of action before possibilities or probabilities UNK , or not directly UNK related , to what we can and may and must do as long as human history UNK STOP
START finally , just as no different issues are UNK for UNK analysis by the UNK of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth , but only UNK and UNK to the imagination , the same thing must be said in connection with the question of what we may perhaps already be doing , by human action , to UNK this end STOP
START we should not allow the image of an UNK end brought about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just UNK order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure UNK the end of our UNK may be one consequence among others of many other of UNK UNK toward we know not what future STOP
START much more than shelter , housing UNK social status , a sense of `` UNK '' , acceptance within a given group or neighborhood , identification with particular cultural values and social institutions , feelings of pride and worth , aspirations and hopes basic to human UNK STOP
START for almost UNK of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence UNK a considerable UNK upon these values assumed as UNK by most americans STOP
START few business groups in recent years have come under UNK pressure to face these realities than real estate UNK and home builders STOP
START this pressure has urged UNK of the assumptions underlying their professional ethics ; ; STOP
START it has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in this country STOP
START it is not surprising that , as UNK for real estate interests , the national association of real estate boards ( UNK ) and its local associations have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure STOP
START how does the local UNK see himself in the context of housing restrictions based on race , religion or UNK UNK ? ? STOP
START what does he conceive his role to be in this area of social UNK ? ? STOP
START what ought to be , what is his potential role as a force for UNK social change ? ? STOP
START what social , ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation ? ? STOP
START recently , a group of the faculty at UNK UNK public affairs center sought some answers to these questions STOP
START several new england realtors were invited to participate in a small UNK of property lawyers , political scientists , UNK , social psychologists , social UNK and UNK STOP
START here , in an atmosphere of UNK and mutual criticism , each sought to bring his particular insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing and the part each man present played in it STOP
START for a number of years , UNK has been drawing varied groups of political and business leaders into these UNK discussions with members of the faculty and student body , attempting to UNK and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy STOP
START this article presents our observations of that session , of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them STOP
START such conversation quickly reveals an UNK significant UNK in the UNK held by most realtors STOP
START within the membership of this group , as has been found true of men in other professional or trade associations , the most ready UNK of UNK to `` the public '' is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests of a UNK or UNK and UNK between them STOP
START professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the UNK fairly and in an efficient manner STOP
START but as conversation goes on , particularly among the realtors themselves , another image UNK , that of considerable power and influence in the community STOP
START obviously , much more than customer UNK is determining the UNK role STOP
START judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential UNK income , educational level and above all , racial UNK ; ; STOP
START and whether these would UNK them for `` UNK '' , `` happy '' relations to other people in certain community areas STOP
START a narrow UNK STOP
START how explicit such factors have been historically is evident in any UNK of UNK UNK cases or in a review of UNK code of ethics article 34 in the code , adopted in UNK , states that `` a UNK should never be UNK in UNK into a neighborhood a character of property or UNK , members of any race or UNK or any individuals whose presence will clearly be UNK to property values in that neighborhood '' STOP
START though the reference to race was UNK by the association in 1950 , being an agent of such `` UNK '' influences still appears as the UNK sin realtors see themselves committed to avoid STOP
START the UNK for this UNK was most frequently expressed in economic terms ; ; STOP
START all UNK the supposed UNK they believed would inevitably UNK to any UNK who openly introduced UNK , particularly negro , peoples into UNK , UNK areas STOP
START they would become UNK as men not interested in being purely real estate `` UNK '' but UNK for some kind of `` cause '' or `` reform '' , and this was no longer to be a `` UNK '' STOP
START obviously what we are confronted with here is the identification of `` professional '' with narrow skills and UNK , the effective UNK of a UNK , rather than UNK to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of one's work STOP
START these men -- for the most part educated in our `` best '' new england colleges , well established UNK and UNK in the community -- under UNK but UNK UNK , reveal little or no objective or explicit UNK or data for their UNK about the interests and attitudes of the people they claim to serve , or about the public responses that actually follow their occasional UNK of a `` UNK relationship '' STOP
START this narrow `` UNK '' does not even fit the present realities of their situation , as the pressure of UNK and the power and UNK of the realtors increase STOP
START as our discussion continued , the UNK of the `` UNK relationship '' as an interpretation of their `` way of operating '' became evident STOP
START realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work , as members of social and professional organizations , as citizens and UNK leaders , as church UNK , as university UNK , as newspaper readers , etc STOP
START from such UNK roles the UNK finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding STOP
START it seems to us that UNK exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas : ( 1 ) the various ways in which they UNK a particular social issue ; ; STOP
START ( 2 ) their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes ; ; STOP
START and , most UNK , ( 3 ) their interpretation of who is a `` real UNK '' , of what it means to be a professional man in a technical , UNK society STOP
START ( 1 ) most of the realtors UNK their own understanding of and role in the racial issue , UNK that they only reflect the attitudes and UNK of their society STOP
START there is some reality to this ; ; STOP
START the commission on race and housing concluded that `` there is no reason to believe that real estate men are either more or less UNK UNK , on the whole , than any other UNK of the american population '' STOP
START but such a reaction UNK the powerful efforts made in the past by both UNK and its local boards for the maintenance of UNK UNK and practices STOP
START also , it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually employed STOP
START like business and university groups generally , these men had very limited knowledge of recent UNK and psychological studies and findings that might UNK the decisions they make STOP
START realtors , both generally and in this group , have invariably UNK residential integration with a decline in property values , a circumstance viewed with considerable UNK STOP
START recent studies by the commission on race and housing and others , however , point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion STOP
START there are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are UNK UNK without great loss of property values , the white population having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation of the UNK desire for UNK housing , UNK , etc STOP
START data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be UNK in terms of the trends in property values before the group comes in STOP
START often they are able to get in only because the area is UNK UNK STOP
START significantly , no UNK and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of the six volumes ( published by the university of california press ) that present the UNK findings STOP
START no one UNK any radical shift in this situation , but questions concerning reading habits , the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must surely be raised STOP
START the role of both church and university as sources of information and UNK within which the implications of such information may be UNK needs consideration STOP
START relevant `` facts '' , however , extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance of `` UNK '' neighborhoods STOP
START discussion of minority housing necessarily involves such basic issues as the intensity of one's democratic conviction and religious belief concerning UNK of opportunity , the function and limitations of government in the UNK of such UNK , and the UNK that world opinion plays upon local UNK of racial UNK and UNK STOP
START `` against the grain of creation '' STOP
START ( 2 ) realtors realize , of course , that they are involved in an increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities for UNK on their relation to UNK as well as opportunities for UNK of their responsibility for racial discrimination in housing STOP
START on the positive side , recent federal action has largely UNK the legal UNK so long enjoyed by the UNK position ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK in housing have now been adopted by UNK states and , while specific provisions have varied , the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage STOP
START realtors in UNK at the UNK expressed interest , for example , in UNK new housing law as setting standards of UNK that they would like `` to have to UNK '' , but in support of which none had been willing to go on public record STOP
START as far as they were aware , the connecticut association of real estate boards had not UNK opposed the UNK passage or UNK in its support STOP
START ( this has not been the case everywhere STOP
START in 1957 , the real estate boards of new york city UNK opposed the then UNK private housing UNK law STOP
START official UNK : the bill was a `` UNK UNK of basic property rights '' STOP
START ) STOP
START there are UNK of UNK as well as commission ; ; STOP
START the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations , either negative or positive , plays a large part in the public acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively enforced STOP
START judicial opinion since the supreme court decision on UNK UNK ( 1948 ) has rendered racial UNK UNK UNK STOP
START such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry , but there is little evidence that realtors , or at least their associations , have UNK the principle in such UNK STOP
START in the states that have passed laws UNK discrimination in the sale or rental of housing , support by real estate associations for UNK and UNK coverage through additional legislation could help remove the UNK of `` social UNK '' that most realtors individually seem determined to avoid STOP
START but as yet , no real estate board has been willing UNK to support such laws or to admit the UNK of UNK minority UNK into UNK neighborhoods STOP
START one of the roles of the social UNK , UNK or UNK in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work STOP
START but UNK to these opportunities UNK that all of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional , white , american good STOP
START such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons are members of a world , let us say a community , that UNK UNK or UNK , but is also UNK UNK since it is UNK STOP
START that community of all creation is , then , the ultimate object of our loyalty and the concrete UNK of all moral judgment STOP
START racial discrimination is wrong , then , not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying to UNK with a few realtors but because it goes against the grain of creation and against the will of the creator STOP
START thus , moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take on theological dimensions STOP
START a UNK society STOP
START ( 3 ) over the years , individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed STOP
START most realtors and real estate UNK talk of themselves as `` professional people '' with the cultural and moral values held by the traditional UNK STOP
START but what significance UNK to `` professional '' , beyond the narrow sense of UNK in meeting a UNK stated needs as already noted ? ? STOP
START our faculty and students pressed this issue more than any other STOP
START as a UNK in the group pointed out , a professional was , before the modern period of technical UNK , one who `` UNK '' to be a UNK and critic of his culture in the use of his particular skills STOP
START if we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors UNK the future of our civilization : science and religion STOP
START science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe , the power of the atom STOP
START religion , or the lack of it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and UNK for all mankind , or whether we UNK this power to leave a world utterly destroyed STOP
START how can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge ? ? STOP
START we may feel UNK at the outlook STOP
START and yet there is a note of hope , because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision STOP
START we are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material , a universe that in a word is not matter but music STOP
START and it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an UNK and an UNK of our faith STOP
START atomic energy STOP
START to see this vision in perspective , we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom STOP
START you know that i could hold right here in my hand the little UNK of UNK metal that was the heart of the UNK that dropped on UNK STOP
START it was only about the size of a baseball ; ; STOP
START but UNK in that UNK ball there was the UNK force of UNK tons of aj STOP
START that is enough UNK to fill the UNK of the empire state building ; ; STOP
START and with the availability of bombs of that size , war became a new problem STOP
START now we might have UNK the use of UNK bombs by controlling the sources of UNK because it is found in only a few places in the world STOP
START but we had hardly started to adjust our thinking to this new UNK weapon when we were faced with the hydrogen UNK STOP
START hydrogen is just as UNK as UNK is UNK STOP
START we know that we have hydrogen in water ; ; STOP
START water is af and the h stands for hydrogen ; ; STOP
START there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies STOP
START i have calculated that if i could UNK my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body , i would UNK with the force of a hundred bombs of the kind that fell on UNK STOP
START i won't try the experiment , but i think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let ourselves go , there would be quite an UNK STOP
START and then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in delaware bay or in the ocean beyond STOP
START salt water is still af , the same hydrogen is there STOP
START and the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today STOP
START of course , there is also an optimistic side to the picture STOP
START for if i knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity , i could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body i could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire united states for some days STOP
START and think , if we all knew this secret and we could pool our power , what a wonderful public utility company we would make STOP
START with just the hydrogen of our bodies , we could run the world for years STOP
START then think of delaware bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come STOP
START it is power with which we can literally UNK the world , provide adequate housing , food , education , UNK living for everyone everywhere STOP
START an UNK atoms STOP
START now let us see where this power comes from STOP
START to UNK our new view of the atom , we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom is STOP
START i have been trying to make this clear to my own class in chemistry STOP
START one night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table , and these peas looked to me like a little group of atoms ; ; STOP
START and i asked myself a question : suppose i had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body , how large an area would they cover ? ? STOP
START i calculated first that there are about an UNK atoms in the average human body ; ; STOP
START that is a figure one with 27 UNK , quite a large number STOP
START then i calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household UNK ; ; STOP
START a billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to UNK ; ; STOP
START a UNK peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people ; ; STOP
START and a UNK peas would fill all the buildings in the city of philadelphia STOP
START i saw that i would soon run out of buildings at this rate , so i decided to take another measure -- the whole state of pennsylvania STOP
START imagine that there is a UNK over pennsylvania , but instead of UNK snow , it UNK peas ; ; STOP
START so we get the whole state covered with peas , about four feet deep STOP
START you can imagine what it would look like going out on the UNK with the peas UNK up against the houses and covering the cars ; ; STOP
START pennsylvania thus UNK would contain about a UNK peas STOP
START but we still have a long way to go STOP
START next we imagine our UNK UNK over all the land areas of the entire UNK -- north america , south america , europe , asia , and africa , all covered with peas four feet deep ; ; STOP
START then we have UNK peas STOP
START next we UNK over the UNK and cover the whole earth with peas , then we go out among the neighboring stars , UNK UNK planets each the size of the earth , and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep ; ; STOP
START and then we have UNK STOP
START finally we go into the UNK reaches of the UNK way ; ; STOP
START we get UNK planets ; ; STOP
START we cover each of these with our UNK of peas and then at last we have UNK peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body STOP
START so you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are STOP
START a UNK -- and space STOP
START now although an atom is small , we can still in imagination have a look at it STOP
START let us focus on an atom of UNK from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that i UNK a magic UNK in UNK growing UNK STOP
START i start growing rapidly and this UNK atom grows along with me STOP
START i shoot up through the roof , into the sky , past the clouds , through the UNK , out beyond the moon , out among the planets , until i am over a hundred and fifty million miles long STOP
START then this atom of UNK will UNK to something like a great UNK a hundred yards across , a UNK big enough to put a UNK field inside STOP
START and if you should step inside of such a UNK atom , according to the physics of forty years ago , you would see UNK over your head , down at the sides , and under your feet , some twenty UNK UNK about the size of UNK STOP
START these UNK are moving in great circles and UNK , and are of course , the UNK , the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of UNK to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone STOP
START since these UNK are moving like planets , you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom STOP
START so you look down there and you see a tiny , UNK point about the size of the head of a UNK STOP
START this is the atomic sun , the atomic UNK STOP
START even if the atom were big enough to hold a UNK field , this UNK is still only about the size of a UNK STOP
START it is this atomic UNK that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these UNK charged UNK in their UNK ; ; STOP
START it also contains nearly all the mass , and the atomic energy STOP
START you may ask what else there is , and the answer is nothing -- nothing but empty space STOP
START and since you are made of atoms , you are nothing much but empty space , too STOP
START if i could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and UNK you down , UNK these holes out of you in the way we UNK the holes out of a UNK , you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone , you would be smaller than the UNK UNK of dust that you could see on this piece of paper STOP
START someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing STOP
START at any rate , it shows us how UNK we are STOP
START music of the UNK STOP
START now this UNK view of the atom was on the whole a UNK picture STOP
START for we believed that the UNK UNK the law of mechanics and UNK ; ; STOP
START and therefore the atom was really just a little machine ; ; STOP
START and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts STOP
START so if you are made of atoms , you are just a big machine ; ; STOP
START and since the universe is also made of atoms , it is just a UNK STOP
START and this would mean that we live in a UNK universe , governed by the laws of cause and effect , bound in UNK of UNK that hold the universe on a completely UNK course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom STOP
START and this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were UNK or UNK STOP
START then came the scientific revolution in the late UNK STOP
START a suggestion from UNK de UNK , a UNK in france , showed us that these UNK are not point particles but waves STOP
START and to see the meaning of this new picture , imagine that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today STOP
START now as you step inside , instead of seeing particles UNK around like planets , you see waves and UNK very much like the UNK that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it STOP
START these UNK spread out in UNK patterns like the rose windows of a great UNK STOP
START and as the waves flow back and forth and UNK with the waves from the neighboring atoms , you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music STOP
START it is a music like the music from a great UNK or a vast orchestra playing a symphony STOP
START harmony , melody , UNK UNK structure are there ; ; STOP
START and as this music UNK and UNK , there is an UNK UNK from all the atoms outside , in fact from the atoms of the entire universe STOP
START and so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe , we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music STOP
START the island of UNK , part of the state of massachusetts , lies about UNK miles UNK of its mother state STOP
START some of the island is sand and is not suitable for living STOP
START the island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors ; ; STOP
START the rest is obtained from harbor UNK STOP
START during about three and a half months of the year , in the summer , there are three boats that run from the UNK to the island carrying UNK , food , and cars ; ; STOP
START but the rest of the year only one boat is needed , which ties up at the UNK nights and makes the trip down to UNK in the daytime STOP
START this is a fine trip , too , on a good day STOP
START with UNK UNK on one side and the open sea on the other , it makes an excellent trip of about three hours STOP
START to what extent and in what ways did christianity affect the united states of america in the nineteenth century ? ? STOP
START how far and in what fashion did it UNK the new nation which was emerging in the UNK of the forces UNK the revolutionary age ? ? STOP
START to what extent did it UNK the UNK and the social , economic , and political life and institutions of the country ? ? STOP
START a complete picture is impossible -- partly because of the limitations of space , partly because for millions of individuals who UNK UNK to the christian faith data are UNK STOP
START even more of an UNK is the difficulty of UNK the influence of christianity from other factors STOP
START although a complete picture cannot be given , we can indicate some aspects of life into which the christian faith entered as at least one creative factor STOP
START at times we can say that it was the major factor STOP
START what in some ways was the most important aspect was the impact individually on the millions who UNK the nation STOP
START as we have seen , a growing proportion , although in UNK still a minority , were members of churches STOP
START presumably those who did not have a formal church UNK had also felt the influence of christianity to a greater or lesser extent STOP
START many of them had once been members of a church or at least had been given instruction in christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the UNK to UNK STOP
START the form of christianity to which they were exposed was for some the protestantism of the older stock , for others the protestantism of the nineteenth-century UNK ; ; STOP
START for still others , mostly of the nineteenth-century UNK , it was roman UNK , and for a small minority it was eastern UNK STOP
START upon all of them played the intellectual , social , political , and economic attitudes , institutions , and customs of the nation STOP
START upon most of these christianity had left an UNK and through them had had a share in making the individual what he was STOP
START yet to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual showed the effects of christianity would be impossible STOP
START at best only an UNK could be arrived at STOP
START to UNK for the entire nation would be absurd STOP
START for instance , we cannot know whether even for church members the degree of conformity to christian standards of morality increased or UNK as the proportion of church members in the population rose STOP
START the UNK is to say that , as the percentage of church members mounted , the degree of discipline exercised by the churches UNK and the trend was towards conformity to the general level STOP
START yet this cannot be proved STOP
START we know that in the early part of the century many protestant congregations took positive action against members who UNK the ethical codes to which the majority UNK STOP
START thus baptist churches on the frontier took UNK of charges against their members of UNK , fighting , UNK UNK , lying , UNK , sexual UNK , UNK , horse UNK , and failure to pay just UNK STOP
START if guilty , the UNK might be UNK from membership STOP
START as church membership UNK , such measures UNK into UNK STOP
START but whether this was accompanied by a general UNK of the moral life of the membership we do not know STOP
START what we can attempt with some hope of UNK conclusions is to point out the manner in which christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation STOP
START we have already UNK at the fashion in which christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life STOP
START we will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in which it UNK efforts to attain those ideals through reform movements , through UNK for bringing the collective life to the nation to conformity to christian standards , and through leaders in the government STOP
START throughout the nineteenth century christianity exerted its influence on american society as a whole primarily through the protestantism of the older stock STOP
START by the end of the century the roman catholic church was beginning to make itself felt , mainly through such institutions as UNK but also through its attitude towards organized UNK STOP
START in the twentieth century its influence grew , as did that of the protestantism of the nineteenth-century UNK STOP
START the american dream STOP
START the ideals of the country were deeply UNK to the protestantism of the older stock STOP
START thus `` america '' , the most widely UNK of the UNK songs , was written by a new england baptist UNK , samuel UNK smith ( UNK ) , while a student in UNK theological UNK STOP
START with its UNK for liberty and its dependence on god it UNK the spirit which had been UNK on the UNK UNK STOP
START the great seal of the united states was obviously inspired by the christian faith STOP
START here was what was called the american dream , namely , the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that god could UNK it STOP
START later in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of UNK lee UNK ( UNK ) , daughter and UNK of new england congregational UNK , in her widely UNK UNK , written in UNK , `` america the beautiful '' , with the words `` o beautiful for UNK feet whose UNK UNK stress a UNK for freedom beat across the UNK STOP
START america , america , god UNK thy every UNK , confirm thy soul in self control , the liberty in law STOP
START o beautiful for UNK dream that sees beyond the years UNK UNK cities UNK UNK by human tears STOP
START america , america , god UNK his grace on thee , and crown thy good with UNK from sea to UNK sea '' STOP
START the american dream was UNK of many UNK STOP
START some were clearly of christian origin , among them the great UNK and other UNK which helped to make christian liberty , christian UNK , and christian UNK the passion of the land STOP
START some have seen UNK and the search for christian UNK as the UNK of the american hope STOP
START here , too , must be placed UNK and , less obviously from christian UNK , UNK , UNK , and the UNK of UNK UNK STOP
START we must also remember those who UNK against the dream as a kind of myth -- among them UNK , UNK , and henry james the UNK , all of them out of a christian background STOP
START reform movements STOP
START with such a dream arising , at least in part , from the protestant heritage of the united states and built into the foundations of the nation , it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete expression STOP
START a number were in the nature of movements to UNK or remove social UNK STOP
START significantly , the UNK and leadership of a major proportion of the reform movements , especially those in the first half of the nineteenth century , came from men and women of new england birth or UNK and from either UNK or UNK UNK STOP
START several of the movements were given a marked UNK by UNK STOP
START UNK , some from new england , had a larger share than their UNK numerical strength would have UNK STOP
START we do well to UNK ourselves that from men and women of new england UNK also issued the church of jesus christ of latter day UNK , the seventh day UNK , christian science , the american board of UNK for foreign missions , the american home missionary society , the american bible society , and new england theology STOP
START the atmosphere was one of UNK , of confidence in human progress , and of a determination to UNK the world of its UNK STOP
START the UNK universal UNK UNK , although holding to original sin and the doctrine of election , inspired its UNK to heroic UNK for others , looked for the early coming of the UNK , and was UNK by the confidence in man's ability UNK by the UNK , UNK , and the UNK STOP
START we should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind which UNK from the UNK UNK of the british UNK and the UNK of the UNK of europe -- among them prison reform , anti-slavery measures , legislation for the UNK of conditions of UNK , the inner mission , and the red cross STOP
START we cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or UNK of collective UNK STOP
START a few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete UNK and description would UNK STOP
START several were born in the early decades and UNK throughout the century STOP
START others were UNK STOP
START some disappeared with the UNK of their purpose STOP
START still others UNK up late in the century to meet conditions which UNK from fresh stages of the revolutionary age STOP
START the anti-slavery movement STOP
START the movement to end negro slavery began before UNK and mounted after that year until , as a result of the civil war , emancipation was achieved STOP
START long before UNK the christian conscience was leading some to UNK slavery wrong and to act accordingly STOP
START for example , in UNK the philadelphia UNK meeting of friends declared that its members should UNK their slaves and in UNK it determined to UNK from membership all who did not UNK STOP
START in the latter year samuel UNK , from whom the UNK strain of new england theology took its name , asked the UNK congress to UNK slavery STOP
START as we have seen , UNK early took a stand against slavery STOP
START beginning at least as far back as UNK various baptist bodies condemned slavery STOP
START after UNK anti-slavery sentiment mounted , chiefly among protestants and those of protestant background of the older stock STOP
START the nineteenth-century UNK , whether protestant or roman catholic , was not so much concerned , for very few if any among them held slaves : they were mostly in the northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out , or were too UNK to own slaves STOP
START the anti-slavery movement took many forms STOP
START UNK UNK ( UNK ) , a UNK , was a pioneer in preparing the way for anti-slavery societies STOP
START it was he who turned the attention of william UNK UNK ( UNK ) to the subject STOP
START UNK , massachusetts born of UNK UNK UNK , was by UNK and conviction a UNK STOP
START chiefly remembered because of his UNK UNK of `` immediate and UNK UNK '' , he also UNK a great variety of other causes -- among them women's rights , UNK , and justice to the indians STOP
START UNK optimistic , UNK , and utterly UNK , in his youth a UNK baptist , in spite of his friendship for the UNK poet john UNK UNK ( UNK ) he eventually attacked the orthodox churches for what he deemed their UNK UNK on the slavery issue and in his invariably UNK manner was UNK UNK and denied the UNK UNK of the bible STOP
START a marked UNK came to the anti-slavery movement through the UNK UNK STOP
START UNK himself , while opposed to slavery , placed his chief emphasis on UNK , but from his UNK issued much of the leadership of the anti-slavery campaign STOP
START UNK UNK UNK ( UNK ) was especially active STOP
START UNK was the son and UNK of new england congregational UNK STOP
START as a youth he became one of UNK band of UNK and gave himself to winning young men STOP
START a strong UNK UNK , through the influence of a favorite teacher , charles UNK , another UNK UNK , he devoted himself to the anti-slavery cause STOP
START a group of young men influenced by him UNK in lane theological UNK and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery position STOP
START the majority then went to the UNK UNK STOP
START they and others employed some of UNK techniques as they sought to win UNK to the cause STOP
START UNK contributed to the anti-slavery convictions of such men as UNK UNK and UNK UNK , UNK john UNK adams , and helped provide ideas which UNK UNK UNK UNK uncle UNK UNK STOP
START he UNK UNK for himself and sought to avoid fame STOP
START UNK UNK ( UNK ) , from a prominent massachusetts family , in his UNK was converted under the preaching of UNK UNK STOP
START although he later broke with the churches because he believed that they were UNK UNK against social UNK , he remained a UNK christian STOP
START he was remembered chiefly for his UNK UNK of UNK , but he also stood for equal rights for women , for opportunity for the UNK , and for UNK STOP
START the anti-slavery movement and other contemporary UNK and UNK were given leadership and financial UNK by arthur UNK ( UNK ) and his younger brother , lewis UNK ( UNK ) STOP
START individuals UNK unusual UNK and great personal power were UNK at death into UNK spirits ; ; STOP
START they were almost immediately UNK for these newer , even more terrible abilities STOP
START their direct UNK UNK not only their UNK UNK , but also the UNK of their UNK power as spirits in the other half of the universe STOP
START royal UNK could be based on extraordinary UNK achievements UNK into eternal UNK power STOP
START thus , the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less UNK UNK STOP
START but this UNK was not without its UNK responsibilities STOP
START since he possessed more power in an UNK universe of living beings and dead spirits , the emperor had to use it for the benefit of the living STOP
START the royal ritual UNK power into the other world : it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits , and bring their powers directly to bear on the UNK affairs of the world STOP
START proper ritual UNK at any level of society was capable of UNK power for use in the spirit world ; ; STOP
START but naturally , the royal ritual , which provided unusual control over already UNK powerful divine spirits , was held responsible for UNK the universe and UNK the welfare of the kingdom STOP
START this is the familiar system of `` cosmic government '' STOP
START the chinese emperor , by proper UNK of ritual , UNK divine powers STOP
START he UNK the UNK of light and darkness , yang and UNK , which are locked in eternal struggle STOP
START by UNK the balance between them , he UNK the UNK of the UNK STOP
START his power was so great that he even UNK and UNK UNK according to whether they had given ear or been UNK to UNK STOP
START in this system , no man is UNK from obligations STOP
START failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one's family , UNK to community UNK , any UNK from rigid standards of moral UNK were UNK against the dead STOP
START and to UNK the dead meant to UNK their UNK , and thus UNK the UNK of UNK UNK STOP
START the family home was , in fact , a temple ; ; STOP
START and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in nature STOP
START the dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and in every fear STOP
START the common belief was that there existed one moral order , which included everything STOP
START the dead controlled the material UNK of the living , and the living UNK to UNK codes of conduct in order not to UNK that control STOP
START men believed they could control nature by UNK a moral code STOP
START if the moral code were UNK , the proper balance of the universe would be UNK , and the UNK result could be UNK , UNK , or UNK STOP
START modern UNK have difficulty UNK this UNK of moral and material , largely because in the west the historical trend has been to deny the connection STOP
START living in urban conditions , away from the UNK of village UNK and the UNK of a UNK world view , the individual may find it possible , say , to UNK UNK not only without personal UNK , but also without suffering any UNK effects in his UNK UNK STOP
START UNK action on the empirical determination of cause and effect provides a UNK and UNK that no powerful UNK UNK could ever UNK -- plus the added UNK from the UNK of UNK UNK UNK STOP
START in china , the magical system UNK UNK was UNK STOP
START the UNK were UNK UNK , who saw an UNK unity -- the UNK -- underlying all phenomena STOP
START it was this UNK unity that was UNK , and not its temporary UNK in the world of reality STOP
START the UNK believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical UNK ; ; STOP
START in other words , they were actually an organization of UNK STOP
START mahayana UNK was no exception to these prevailing magical concepts STOP
START after this form of indian UNK had been introduced into china , it UNK extensive changes STOP
START during its UNK in the sixth to the eighth centuries , mahayana offered a supernatural package to the chinese which bears no UNK to the highly UNK philosophical zen UNK offered to the modern western reader STOP
START mahayana had UNK , and magic , a UNK , UNK and UNK , and UNK UNK priests , UNK , and UNK , all of whom UNK power over souls in the other world STOP
START the UNK mahayana UNK possessed UNK powers and magic STOP
START the mahayana that developed in the north was a religion of UNK and UNK magic , that made the world into a huge magical garden STOP
START in its UNK form , mahayana was merely an organization of UNK UNK ( UNK ) , who UNK to the chinese faith in the supernatural STOP
START UNK UNK was a secular , rational philosophy , but even with this different orientation it could not escape from the UNK of a cosmic government STOP
START UNK had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power STOP
START if a man lived a classical life , he need not fear the spirits -- for only lack of virtue gave the spirits power over him STOP
START but let us not be UNK about UNK `` virtue '' ; ; STOP
START this was not virtue as we understand the word today , and it did not mean an UNK of the belief in magic UNK STOP
START to the UNK , `` virtue '' simply meant UNK and correct UNK of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand minor ones STOP
START UNK was UNK with ritual UNK , the mark of a true gentleman STOP
START to live correctly in an UNK moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive for man's fate STOP
START this , in brief , was the historical background out of which zen emerged STOP
START UNK of zen to the west record its UNK , and recognize that zen grew out of a combination of UNK and indian mahayana UNK STOP
START but the `` UNK person '' that is supposed to result from zen exhibits more chinese UNK than indian UNK -- he UNK magical powers , and can use them to order nature and to UNK souls STOP
START UNK of zen to the west emphasize UNK the amount of mahayana UNK in zen , probably in order to UNK the UNK magical UNK ideas with more respectable UNK UNK STOP
START but in the chinese mind , there was little difference between the two -- the UNK were no more metaphysical than a UNK has to be STOP
START actually , zen UNK more to chinese UNK than it does to mahayana UNK STOP
START the UNK ( zen ) UNK may have derived its UNK from mahayana , but its psychology was pure early UNK STOP
START this is well evidenced by the UNK UNK carried over in zen : the idea of the UNK turning of thought , the UNK to put aside desires and UNK so that a return to UNK , peace , and UNK -- a union with the infinite , with the UNK -- could be UNK STOP
START in fact , the UNK to UNK UNK UNK by modern UNK as so UNK characteristic of the `` direct thinking '' UNK was a feature of UNK STOP
START so , too , was the UNK on the UNK of the external world , and the ideas that language and things UNK by consciousness were poor UNK indeed for immediate perception by pure , UNK spirit : the opposition of pure consciousness to UNK consciousness STOP
START zen maintains that UNK things are only the surface of experience STOP
START one of its features attractive to the west is its UNK for tradition and UNK and for sacred UNK STOP
START one UNK is supposed to have UNK sacred UNK for use in an UNK STOP
START but this is not the spirit of UNK freedom of action for which the UNK UNK it STOP
START it is simply that in UNK tradition -- as in all good UNK -- books , words , or any other UNK that belong to the normal state of consciousness are considered only the surface of experience STOP
START the truth -- the eternal truth -- is not UNK by words STOP
START reality is considered not only UNK to the acquisition of higher knowledge , but a positive UNK STOP
START the technique of reality confusion -- the use of UNK and UNK to UNK the UNK UNK on reality -- UNK with fourth and third century UNK UNK : the UNK is not basically a new device STOP
START it is important for an understanding of zen to realize that the UNK UNK of the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common man STOP
START in the supernatural atmosphere of cosmic government , only the ruling UNK was ever concerned with a UNK ordering of nature : popular religion aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers STOP
START and this is only natural -- witness the UNK with which modern man UNK the latest `` wonder drug '' STOP
START early chinese UNK was UNK aimed at a UNK UNK union with the divine , personal salvation being achieved when the UNK UNK united with divine essence STOP
START but this UNK doctrine was lost in the UNK to acquire special powers STOP
START the UNK UNK , in fact , to UNK influence the world of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor UNK his power STOP
START thus , the mahayana UNK of UNK union for salvation was UNK down to a UNK UNK , and for this reason , the UNK in asia did not long remain in isolated UNK STOP
START as the zen literature reveals , as soon as an early zen master UNK fame in UNK , he was called out into the world to exercise his powers STOP
START the early UNK UNK attracted UNK because of their UNK ability to perform UNK STOP
START UNK of zen often insist that very early zen doctrine opposed the UNK UNK of china , and proposed instead a more mature , less UNK view of the universe STOP
START in support of this , stories from the early literature are cited to show that zen UNK the idea of supernatural power STOP
START but actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the UNK were in fact supposed to possess , as well as the extreme degree of popular UNK : `` UNK UNK ( o UNK ) , one day going up mount UNK UNK which was believed to have been UNK by UNK with supernatural powers , met with a monk whose eyes UNK strange light STOP
START they went along the pass talking with each other for a short while until they came to a river UNK with UNK STOP
START there being no bridge , the master had to stop at the shore ; ; STOP
START but his UNK crossed the river walking on the water and UNK to UNK UNK to follow him STOP
START UNK UNK UNK said : `` if i knew UNK art an UNK , i would have UNK you up before UNK got over there '' ! ! STOP
START the monk then understood the spiritual UNK of UNK UNK , and UNK him as a true UNK STOP
START ( 1 ) '' STOP
START a second UNK shows still more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess : `` on one occasion yang UNK ( UNK ) saw a UNK monk flying through the air STOP
START when that monk came down and approached him with a UNK UNK , he asked : `` where art UNK from '' ? ? STOP
START `` early this morning '' , replied the other , `` i set out from india '' STOP
START `` why '' , said the teacher , `` art UNK so late '' ? ? STOP
START `` i stopped '' , responded the man , `` several times to look at beautiful UNK '' STOP
START `` UNK UNK have supernatural powers '' , UNK yang UNK , `` yet UNK must give back the spirit of UNK to me '' STOP
START then the monk UNK yang UNK saying : `` i have come over to china in order to worship UNK , and met UNK with minor UNK '' , and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from india , went back through the air STOP
START ( 2 ) '' STOP
START in the popular chinese mind , UNK ( zen ) was no exception to the ideas of UNK magic that dominated STOP
START a closer look at modern zen reveals many magical UNK that are still part of popular zen attitudes STOP
START to the zen monk the universe is still UNK with `` spiritual beings '' who have to be UNK STOP
START part of the UNK ritual in the UNK consists in UNK of rice to the spiritual beings '' STOP
START modern zen presentation to the west UNK on the UNK , highly UNK nature of the zen belief -- UNK are burned to make fire , action is based on direct UNK , and so on STOP
START this picture of extreme UNK UNK is difficult to UNK with such UNK formulas as : `` o you , UNK and other spiritual beings , i now offer this to you , and may this food fill up the ten quarters of the world and all the UNK and other spiritual beings be fed UNK STOP
START ( 3 ) STOP
START pope UNK 13 , on the UNK day of december UNK , granted the following UNK : `` an UNK of three hundred days is granted to all the UNK who read the holy UNK at least a quarter of an hour STOP
START a UNK UNK under the usual conditions is granted once a month for the daily reading '' STOP
START pope UNK the sixth , at rome , in april , UNK , wrote the following : `` the UNK should be UNK to the reading of the holy UNK : for these are the most UNK sources which ought to be left open to everyone , to draw from them UNK of UNK and of doctrine , to UNK errors which are so widely UNK in these UNK times '' STOP
START the american UNK assembled at the third UNK council of baltimore urged the catholic people to read the holy bible STOP
START `` we hope '' , they said , `` that no family can be found UNK us without a correct version of the holy UNK '' STOP
START they recommended , also , that `` at a fixed hour , let the entire family be assembled for night prayers , followed by a short reading of the holy UNK '' STOP
START since the catholic church UNK such desire that the sacred UNK be read , the following taken from the holy bible ( new catholic edition ) will prove a means of grace and a source of great spiritual UNK STOP

START new schools were rising , but with this went a UNK proclamation : any academic degree UNK during UNK UNK was UNK STOP
START economic aid ? ? STOP
START he had promised UNK housing : UNK he cut all UNK in half , whether the UNK was a UNK UNK or a UNK whose only income was the rental of a spare room STOP
START under another law , hundreds of UNK were UNK STOP
START farm workers had their wages cut almost in half STOP
START of this , only 50 cents a day was paid in cash , the rest in UNK UNK only in `` people's stores '' STOP
START a suspicion was growing that UNK castro was a communist STOP
START in my mind , i began to review : his use of hate to gain support ; ; STOP
START his people's courts ; ; STOP
START his division of society into two classes , one the hero , the other the UNK STOP
START but most disturbing of all were the UNK he called to sit with him in the palace ; ; STOP
START many came from communist countries STOP
START what should i do about it , i asked myself ? ? STOP
START i had watched castro handling his enemies before the UNK STOP
START there was no doubt in my mind that if i crossed him , UNK would appear outside our windows UNK `` UNK ! ! STOP
START UNK ! ! STOP
START '' STOP
START what should i do ? ? STOP
START i was proud of the new buildings which UNK UNK now : the UNK , UNK behind glass UNK ; ; STOP
START the UNK and UNK of our new UNK STOP
START here was a powerful , UNK medium , but it could speak only if i told it to STOP
START then one day , early in january , 1960 , i sat down at my desk , and suddenly i was aware of the UNK STOP
START it was a simple UNK UNK which my mother had given me STOP
START i had mounted it on UNK and hung it over my desk to UNK me always to use the power of the paper in a christian manner STOP
START now it seemed almost as if jesus were looking down at me with UNK in his eyes , saying : STOP
START `` you will lose the paper STOP
START you may lose your life STOP
START but do you have any choice '' ? ? STOP
START i knew in that moment that i did not have any choice STOP
START from that day on i began to write UNK about the things i did not think correct in UNK UNK UNK STOP
START too often a beginning UNK has to do his training UNK either because his parents don't want UNK to `` UNK all those old UNK things '' because `` you'll UNK your growth '' or because UNK UNK from his UNK , like `` UNK UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK do with all those muscles ( of which he has none at the time ) '' ? ? STOP
START after all , a UNK UNK have a little UNK ! ! STOP
START therefore it's a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy UNK who has never had to train in secret has never heard one UNK word from his parents and never has been UNK by his UNK ! ! STOP
START this happy , always UNK UNK with the UNK UNK is our new junior UNK -- henri de UNK STOP
START far from UNK henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater UNK STOP
START instead of UNK him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master UNK UNK authority , professor UNK UNK STOP
START and they couldn't have UNK henri to better hands because `` UNK UNK '' knows his muscles from the UNK UNK of the neck right down to the UNK UNK of the leg and better still , he knows just what exercises work best for them and what UNK principles to combine them with for fast , fast muscle growth STOP
START that's because the good professor UNK only UNK methods at his famous UNK health UNK which is located at UNK UNK east in UNK STOP
START undoubtedly you have read the case UNK of some of his UNK pupils ( every pupil has a UNK title of some kind or other ) STOP
START there's UNK UNK who is our UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK , whose story appeared here two issues ago ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK , who was with us last month ; ; STOP
START charles UNK , who recently won the `` most UNK man '' UNK award in the UNK event ; ; STOP
START and a host of others STOP
START UNK , the professor knows his muscles ! ! STOP
START now when henri was just 12 he was only UNK UNK '' tall and weighed an UNK UNK pounds , and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight STOP
START about that time he began reading UNK and muscle builder and he learned of the famous UNK way to fast weight UNK STOP
START seeing so many illustrations and reading so many UNK to the value of UNK and UNK , those two UNK UNK food UNK , he decided to try them and see what they could do for him STOP
START well , sir they did real great ! ! STOP
START for in almost less time than it takes to tell it , UNK UNK was increasing rapidly STOP
START of course he did some UNK STOP
START he's UNK about water UNK and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction with the added food UNK UNK pounds of solid muscle on his UNK frame STOP
START henri has always had UNK legs from swimming and water UNK and really doesn't have to work them very much STOP
START but he was UNK UNK with his upper body STOP
START it was UNK but it wasn't UNK STOP
START `` a real ' nothing ' UNK '' , says henri STOP
START `` it never seemed to UNK STOP
START it just got longer and longer '' STOP
START that's when he went to professor UNK STOP
START and at once UNK saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it STOP
START in his UNK the professor has some of the most `` knocked out '' equipment since UNK UNK STOP
START UNK is a specialist in UNK development and he has long UNK the UNK UNK UNK UNK technique in which one exercise of the UNK is a pressing or `` UNK '' movement which UNK one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` UNK '' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group STOP
START so right away UNK introduced henri to his famous `` moon '' bench and proceeded to teach him his first UNK UNK consisting of the UNK UNK UNK ( the `` pull '' part of the UNK UNK ) which UNK UNK the UNK and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest and the UNK bench press which specifically works on the chest to build those wide , UNK `` UNK '' UNK , while UNK the upper UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START as you can see , in this UNK UNK set the entire UNK area is UNK exercised in UNK UNK by UNK exercises so the complete UNK remains UNK all the time ! ! STOP
START now when henri has completed four complete UNK UNK UNK , the professor allows him about a UNK rest period before starting him on four complete UNK UNK UNK STOP
START UNK UNK is made up of similar exercises , but this time done with UNK , and using both `` moon '' and flat UNK STOP
START the `` push '' exercise of this UNK UNK is the bench press done with UNK well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the UNK not possible with the UNK variation STOP
START you need the UNK variation to build width and mass in the UNK STOP
START the UNK variation UNK a most UNK UNK UNK to the aj STOP
START the `` pull '' exercise in this UNK is the UNK UNK UNK STOP
START ( note how strongly the upper UNK and UNK are worked in this fine exercise because of the UNK concentration of force which the UNK variation UNK ) STOP
START in the third UNK UNK the `` push '' exercise is the UNK UNK between bars , while the `` pull '' exercise is the moon bench UNK raise with bent arms STOP
START the UNK done in this manner is the greatest UNK UNK ever UNK ! ! STOP
START this is true only if a very wide UNK is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved STOP
START you'll know when you've made the greatest stretch because your shoulder UNK will touch ! ! STOP
START as you see , the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the UNK to use a UNK UNK STOP
START he has to ; ; STOP
START he just can't do anything about it at all ! ! STOP
START but as you can also see , it's not a painful exercise at all , because henri de UNK -- the `` happy '' UNK -- looks as though he were having the time of his life ! ! STOP
START the last exercise of UNK UNK prescribed program for henri is a single exercise , done in individual sets with a bit longer UNK between sets STOP
START by this time UNK entire UNK area is UNK to almost UNK point , and UNK takes time to do a bit more UNK UNK UNK work STOP
START he has henri do from four to six sets of the UNK bench press ( note the high UNK ) STOP
START this gives a wide UNK to the UNK , causing them to flow UNK upward into UNK and UNK downward into the UNK and aj STOP
START this is the kind of chest that invariably UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START that UNK `` UNK rock '' looks of the great UNK STOP
START so with four complete UNK UNK UNK , four of UNK , four of UNK and four to six sets of the UNK bench press , you can see that henri de UNK has had a UNK UNK , UNK , UNK UNK that cannot be improved upon STOP
START UNK UNK are rarely won on muscle size alone STOP
START UNK still is a UNK or UNK of true UNK build STOP
START the aspects of physical development that catch the UNK eyes and which UNK influence their decisions are UNK and that UNK of the true UNK -- superior definition of the muscles STOP
START now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional UNK , UNK , UNK UNK STOP
START but contest definition -- that dramatic UNK separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been UNK by a UNK UNK -- is something quite different STOP
START this comes not alone from UNK , UNK training , but from certain UNK exercises which the UNK UNK for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him STOP
START often these exercises work well for some UNK but less UNK for others STOP
START because they are `` minority '' exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the UNK of the forgotten STOP
START only when the UNK UNK or UNK UNK them and puts them into practice are we UNK with them and once again see how effective they really are STOP
START the exercise i shall discuss in this -- the first of a new series of articles on muscle UNK of a particular body part -- is the one leg UNK STOP
START why it was ever forgotten for even a moment i cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone , no matter whether he has short or long UNK lengths ! ! STOP
START it is the one exercise that UNK influences the definition of the UNK at the UNK -- that mark of the UNK that sets him apart from all other UNK ; ; STOP
START a UNK of muscle `` drama '' that is UNK to judges and audiences alike ; ; STOP
START the UNK of UNK development that UNK UNK STOP
START definition of the UNK at the UNK part is quite commonly seen in most UNK UNK UNK which is easily UNK STOP
START the one leg UNK is a split and all UNK practice this in their regular UNK STOP
START but for purely definition purposes -- used in conjunction with your regular UNK , leg UNK , leg UNK programs -- a heavy weight is not needed STOP
START indeed , a UNK weight works much better because a greater , more extensive split can be performed STOP
START used in several sets of high UNK once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire upper leg takes on a UNK definition in which the muscles look like wire UNK UNK and UNK under the skin ! ! STOP
START really there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way into your leg program at all times , for the following suggestions show why it is so effective : 1 STOP
START it's a complete UNK UNK exercise STOP
START 2 STOP
START it places UNK tension on the leg muscles from start to finish of each UNK STOP
START 3 STOP
START it UNK over-all balance and control for the UNK , and helps to make UNK more easily and more correctly performed STOP
START 4 STOP
START it increases flexibility of the legs STOP
START 5 STOP
START it speeds muscle growth and power development even for the advanced UNK because each UNK and leg is exercised UNK , thus UNK a massive , concentrated effort to be UNK on each STOP
START you'll need your UNK power stands for this fine exercise and UNK the way it's done : 1 STOP
START place your power stands in position and adjust their height so that this will UNK to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy clean STOP
START 2 STOP
START place a UNK UNK across them ; ; STOP
START UNK the bar ( which will rest against the back of your neck ) ; ; STOP
START extend your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split STOP
START now raise the weight by UNK your front leg , without moving your feet STOP
START when the front UNK is straight and locked , allow it to UNK again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the sides of the power stands STOP
START 3 STOP
START after you have taken a UNK , reverse the position of your legs so that the front UNK of the previous exercise is now to the rear , and the rear UNK now to the front , and perform the same movement in the same manner STOP
START that's the UNK UNK in a UNK STOP
START you should have a couple of training UNK to stand by when you make your first experiments just for safety STOP
START you should also begin this exercise with a very light UNK until you become UNK to it UNK STOP
START oh , you'll UNK and UNK quite a bit at first STOP
START but don't worry STOP
START before your first training experiment has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it you'll be raising and UNK yourself just like a veteran ! ! STOP
START although i suggested that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there's no reason why you UNK make some experiments with the bar held in front of the neck STOP
START UNK UNK and UNK UNK would both benefit UNK by UNK those variations providing that they remember to make UNK sets with the left and right leg to the front STOP
START the most beautiful bed of pansies i've seen was in a south UNK yard on a UNK day STOP
START pansies are supposed to like it cool , but those great UNK flowers were healthy and UNK in the UNK sun STOP
START i sought out the UNK and asked him what he did to produce such UNK in that weather STOP
START he seemed UNK by my question STOP
START `` i just love them '' , he said STOP
START the more i talked with him , the more convinced i became that that was the secret of their UNK UNK STOP
START of course his love was expressed in UNK care STOP
START he UNK the UNK seeds himself , buying them from a UNK specialist STOP
START these specialists , i learned , have done a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers STOP
START their seeds produce vigorous UNK plants half again the size of the UNK UNK STOP
START i asked him if he took seeds from his own plants STOP
START occasionally , when he had an unusual UNK that he wanted more of he did ; ; STOP
START but UNK seeds , he told me , soon `` run down '' STOP
START it's best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them STOP
START his soil was `` nothing special '' , just UNK land , but he had UNK in UNK until it was loose , UNK and UNK STOP
START i UNK it and had the feeling of UNK that comes with the right UNK , UNK and body STOP
START it isn't easy to describe it , but every UNK knows it when his fingers touch such soil STOP
START nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies STOP
START they UNK quickly , the tiny plants UNK in a week , and grow along UNK STOP
START it doesn't really matter which month of the year you UNK them , but they UNK best when they have a wide variation of temperature , very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours STOP
START i like to make a UNK right in the open , though many people start them successfully in cold frames STOP
START pansies don't have to be UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK rather have things rugged , with only moderate protection on the UNK days STOP
START if you do use a cold frame be sure that its UNK is adequate STOP
START for my UNK i use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage UNK STOP
START i UNK it , UNK it smooth , UNK the seeds and wet them down with a UNK spray STOP
START then i cover the UNK with a board STOP
START this UNK it cool and UNK and UNK it from birds STOP
START UNK carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no UNK hills nearby STOP
START when the first UNK of green appears i remove the board STOP
START a light , porous UNK applied now UNK the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of growth STOP
START i like UNK for this , or hay STOP
START when they have 4 to 6 leaves and are UNK little plants , it's time to set them out where they are to remain STOP
START every time you UNK a UNK you cause its flowers to become smaller STOP
START the moral is : don't UNK it any UNK than you must STOP
START as soon as they are large enough to move , i put mine 9 inches apart where they are to UNK STOP
START i put a little UNK of UNK UNK rock or UNK bone meal into each hole with the plant STOP
START that UNK UNK , and the better developed the roots , the larger and more UNK the flowers STOP
START pansies are UNK STOP
START i doubt if it is possible to UNK them STOP
START i UNK lots of UNK into their bed ; ; STOP
START lacking that , UNK UNK spread over the bed is fine STOP
START one year i simply set the plants in the remains of a UNK UNK , to which a little sand had been added , and i had the most beautiful pansies in my , or any of my UNK experience STOP
START in addition to the rich soil they benefit by UNK of UNK water every other week , UNK to the color of weak tea STOP
START as a substitute for this , organic UNK dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions , may be used STOP
START they need UNK STOP
START we put a light UNK over the UNK ; ; STOP
START now we must use a heavy one STOP
START three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping UNK down and the soil UNK and cool STOP
START when winter comes be ready with additional UNK STOP
START i like hay for this and apply it so that only the UNK of the plants show right after a good UNK STOP
START that UNK in the cold , UNK UNK and UNK the UNK of UNK UNK and UNK STOP
START don't miss the pansies that appear from time to time through the winter STOP
START whenever there is a UNK or a few UNK days , you'll be likely to find a brave little UNK or two STOP
START if those aren't enough for you , why not grow some just for winter UNK ? ? STOP
START the pansies i UNK most UNK for me in february during a particularly cold winter STOP
START i started the seed in a flat in june and set out the little pansies in a cold frame STOP
START ( an UNK UNK would have been better , if i had had one STOP
START ) the plants took zero nights in their UNK , with nothing but a UNK of UNK over the glass to protect them STOP
START in response to the UNK days of february they UNK , then UNK their UNK UNK flowers STOP
START that cold frame was my UNK builder ; ; STOP
START its mass of bright UNK set in a UNK of snow made my spirits rise every time i looked at it STOP
START like UNK in december , pansies are far more exciting in february than in may STOP
START try that late winter UNK when you are so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it STOP
START the day will come , in UNK , when you find your plants becoming `` UNK '' , running to UNK UNK at the expense of UNK STOP
START try UNK down each separate branch to the earth , using a UNK UNK to hold it there STOP
START pick the flowers , keep the soil UNK , and each of the UNK branches will take root and become a little plant and go on UNK for the rest of the season STOP
START as soon as an experimental UNK UNK you that roots have taken over , cut it off from the mother plant STOP
START a second and also good practice is to shear off the UNK , leaving an inch high UNK with just a UNK or two on each branch STOP
START these UNK plants will UNK and UNK in record time and will UNK just as they did in early spring STOP
START i like to shear half my plants at a time , leaving one half of them to UNK while the second half is getting started on its new round of UNK STOP
START probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all UNK is to let the UNK go to seed STOP
START UNK aim , different from ours , is to provide for the coming generation STOP
START that done , her work is accomplished and she UNK the plant STOP
START here is a word of advice when you go shopping for your UNK seeds STOP
START go to a UNK UNK , preferably a UNK specialist STOP
START it is no harder to raise big , healthy , UNK plants than weak , UNK little things ; ; STOP
START in fact it is easier STOP
START but you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow STOP
START many people think that pansies last only a few weeks , then their period of growth and UNK is over STOP
START that is not true STOP
START if the plants are UNK for and protected over the winter , the second year is more UNK than the first STOP
START would you like to grow UNK pansies ? ? STOP
START remove about half the branches from each plant , leaving only the strongest with the largest UNK STOP
START the flowers will be huge STOP
START pansies have character STOP
START they stick to their principles , insist upon their due , but grow and UNK with UNK UNK if given it STOP
START treat them right and UNK make a showing every month in the year except the UNK ones STOP
START give them food , some shade , UNK , water and more food , and UNK UNK your UNK with beauty STOP
START a UNK with UNK and UNK is a popular and UNK UNK addition to a meal , but add an UNK and you have something really special STOP
START this delightful UNK fruit has become well-known in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship UNK anywhere in the united states STOP
START it has a great many UNK to recommend it and if you UNK made UNK a part of your diet yet , you really should STOP
START you will find that UNK is unlike any other fruit you have ever UNK STOP
START it is roughly shaped like a large UNK , and when properly UNK , its dark green skin covers a UNK , UNK UNK that has about the consistency of a UNK UNK UNK , but UNK STOP
START the UNK should have a `` give '' to it , as you hold it , when it is UNK STOP
START the flavor is neither sweet , like a UNK , nor UNK like an UNK ; ; STOP
START it is subtle and rather UNK , UNK STOP
START it is a flavor that might take a little getting used to -- not because it is UNK , but because the flavor is hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruits STOP
START sometimes it takes several `` UNK '' of UNK to catch that delightful quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout the world STOP
START once you become an UNK UNK , you will look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation STOP
START naturally UNK and no spray danger STOP
START today , UNK UNK have made the shipping of UNK possible to any place in the world STOP
START the fruit is allowed to mature on the tree , but it is still firm at this point STOP
START it is brought to packing houses , UNK and UNK as to size and quality , and UNK in UNK UNK STOP
START the fruit is then cooled to UNK a temperature at which it UNK into a sort of UNK state STOP
START this cooling does not change the UNK in any way , it just UNK the natural UNK of the fruit until a UNK temperature ( room temperature ) is UNK STOP
START this happens on the UNK UNK or in your kitchen STOP
START one of the most attractive things about UNK is that they do not require processing of any kind STOP
START there is no UNK or UNK or UNK needed STOP
START if the temperature is controlled properly , the UNK will delay its UNK until needed STOP
START and unlike other fruits , one cannot eat the skin of the UNK STOP
START it is thick , much like an egg UNK skin , so that UNK UNK , if they are used , present no UNK to the consumer STOP
START UNK and a UNK UNK STOP
START good taste and UNK , plus safety from spray UNK would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit , even if its UNK values were limited STOP
START UNK , however , are very rich in UNK STOP
START their main UNK is an UNK of UNK UNK UNK , so necessary for maintaining the good health of the UNK system STOP
START aside from this , the average portion contains some protein , an UNK amount of UNK a and c -- about UNK of the minimum daily requirement , and about a third of the official UNK e requirement STOP
START the b UNK are well represented , especially UNK and UNK STOP
START UNK , UNK and iron are present in UNK amounts , and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts STOP
START none of these values is destroyed , not significantly altered by refrigeration storage STOP
START UNK UNK , of the UNK administration hospital , UNK UNK , UNK , and the university of UNK school of medicine , set out to discover if UNK , because of their high content of UNK UNK UNK , would reduce the UNK of the blood in selected patients STOP
START the study UNK 16 male patients , ranging in age from 27 to UNK STOP
START they were put on control UNK to determine as accurately as possible , the normal UNK level of their blood STOP
START then they were given 1 to UNK UNK per day as a substitute for part of their UNK fat consumption STOP
START five , four , three , two , one , fire ! ! STOP
START the tremendous energy released by UNK UNK engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard STOP
START the UNK UNK of energy UNK at the UNK of your UNK STOP
START never before has the introduction of a weapon caused so much UNK and fear STOP
START nuclear weapons are UNK , but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a UNK and UNK UNK which is much more UNK STOP
START a great many writers are UNK by the apparently overwhelming advantage an UNK would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear UNK STOP
START it is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an UNK , in possession of such absolute power , would simultaneously destroy his UNK cities and people STOP
START with a nation UNK before it , why would the UNK spare the UNK people ? ? STOP
START wouldn't the UNK destruction of cities and people be the logical act of complete UNK ? ? STOP
START the nation would be utterly UNK STOP
START the will of its people , so crucial in time of UNK , would be broken STOP
START nuclear weapons have given the world the means for UNK in hours or days ; ; STOP
START and now UNK have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes STOP
START at this point it should be UNK obvious that cities , being `` soft '' , and the people within them are UNK suited to destruction by nuclear weapons STOP
START however , because this UNK is mutual , it is to the advantage of neither side to destroy the UNK cities , at least so long as the UNK has nuclear weapons with which to effect UNK STOP
START it should be UNK apparent that UNK is not a profitable military UNK STOP
START UNK have given us a capability which could be used in two different ways STOP
START they could be used to attack a nation's people ( which would inevitably mean the loss of the UNK own people ) , or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the UNK military force STOP
START if our national interest lies in being able to fight and win a war rather than UNK national UNK , then we must take a much more UNK look at ballistic missiles STOP
START we must determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves STOP
START we must make certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job to the missile STOP
START missiles are very valuable weapons , but they also have their too little known limitations STOP
START because of a UNK ballistic UNK , the location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately STOP
START placing missiles in submarines , on UNK , UNK , UNK , surface vessels and in the air provides them with UNK protection by taking advantage of the UNK weakness of long-range ballistic missiles today -- the extreme difficulty of destroying a mobile or moving target with such weapons STOP
START one must first UNK a UNK mobile or moving target , decide that it is worthy of destruction , select the missile to be fired against the target , UNK UNK for the flight , and prepare the missile for firing STOP
START even if all these operations could be performed UNK , the UNK still has a time of flight to the target of about 30 minutes STOP
START therefore , if the target can significantly change its location in something less than 30 minutes , the probability of having destroyed it is UNK UNK STOP
START because of this , it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will seek UNK in UNK -- at least until missile UNK are UNK which have an UNK high kill probability STOP
START in order to destroy the UNK mobile , moving , or UNK located strategic forces , we must have a UNK capability in addition to our missiles STOP
START until this UNK operation can be performed by UNK , UNK aircraft appear to be the only means available to us STOP
START it seems reasonable that if general nuclear war is not to be one UNK act of burning each UNK citizens to UNK , we must have a UNK strategic force of UNK aircraft capable of going into china or russia to find and destroy their strategic forces which continued to UNK us STOP
START let us suppose the russians decide to build a UNK UNK force STOP
START it is entirely feasible to UNK aircraft such as the UNK or UNK in UNK operations against soviet UNK missiles STOP
START if we stop thinking in terms of tremendous UNK nuclear weapons and consider UNK much smaller nuclear weapons which may be more appropriate for most important military targets , it would seem that the UNK or UNK could carry a great many small nuclear weapons STOP
START an aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons could very UNK be given a mission to UNK all UNK operating within a specified UNK area of russia -- provided that we had used some of our UNK to UNK UNK air UNK before our bombers got there STOP
START the aircraft could be used to destroy other mobile , UNK , and UNK located targets as well as the known , fixed and UNK targets which can also be destroyed by missile STOP
START why , then , aren't we planning a larger , more important role for UNK military aircraft ? ? STOP
START is there any other way to do the job ? ? STOP
START UNK of our strategic forces ( UNK , mobile and UNK UNK , UNK atlas and UNK , and UNK UNK ) means that it will take some time , perhaps weeks , to destroy a strategic force STOP
START war , under these circumstances , cannot be one massive exchange of nuclear UNK STOP
START forces will survive a surprise attack , and these forces will give depth , or considerable UNK , to the conflict STOP
START the forces which survive the initial attack must be found and destroyed STOP
START even mobile forces must be found and destroyed STOP
START but , how does one go about the job of finding and destroying mobile forces ? ? STOP
START they are not UNK to UNK destruction by ballistic missile STOP
START some day , many years in the future , true UNK will be able to find and destroy mobile targets STOP
START but until we have an effective UNK , the answer to the UNK problem is UNK aircraft STOP
START however , the aircraft which we have today are tied to large , `` soft '' UNK STOP
START nuclear UNK can destroy UNK with ease STOP
START here then is our problem : aircraft are vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions which a missile is UNK UNK of UNK ; ; STOP
START but the UNK , on which the aircraft is completely dependent , is UNK by the missile STOP
START this makes today's aircraft a UNK , or one mission , weapon STOP
START aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once STOP
START this is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft in favor of the missile STOP
START but remember this -- it isn't the aircraft which is UNK to nuclear UNK , it is the UNK STOP
START eliminate the UNK of aircraft on the ground and you have essentially eliminated its UNK to long-range ballistic missiles STOP
START there are four rather obvious ways to reduce or eliminate the UNK of aircraft on the ground : STOP
START put aircraft in `` UNK '' UNK when they are on the ground STOP
START build long-range aircraft which can take off from small ( UNK ) UNK with UNK STOP
START if we could use all the small UNK we have in this country , we could UNK our strategic aircraft by a factor of 10 or more STOP
START use nuclear UNK to keep our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their useful life STOP
START using very high UNK ratio engines , develop a UNK ( UNK ) long-range military aircraft STOP
START we have the technology today with which to build aircraft shelters which could UNK at least 200 aj STOP
START we could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters STOP
START large , long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability to take off from UNK UNK , but they would require more powerful engines than we have today STOP
START there is little enthusiasm for spending money to develop more powerful engines because of the UNK belief that the aircraft has been made UNK by the missile STOP
START this same UNK with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted in our UNK effort to develop nuclear UNK for aircraft STOP
START one seldom UNK the analogy `` nuclear UNK will do for the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine '' STOP
START if , for some reason such as economy , we are not going to develop aircraft nuclear UNK with a sense of national UNK , then we should turn our effort to developing jet engines with a UNK ratio of 12 or 15 to one STOP
START with UNK such as these , vertical UNK and landing combat aircraft could be built STOP
START for example , a UNK engine would power a UNK UNK UNK STOP
START with a UNK engine , a UNK aircraft UNK UNK pounds could rise UNK STOP
START the reason that we are not going ahead full speed to develop high UNK engines is that it would cost perhaps a billion dollars -- and you don't spend that sort of money if aircraft are UNK STOP
START when aircraft are no longer helpless on UNK , they are no longer UNK to aj STOP
START if our UNK bombers were , today , capable of UNK a surprise missile attack and because of infinite UNK or long endurance had the capability to strike at russia again , and again , and again , those bombers would UNK assure our military UNK STOP
START we would have the means to seek out and destroy the UNK force -- whether it were fixed or mobile STOP
START with such a force of UNK bombers we could bring enormous pressure to bear on an enemy , and this pressure would be selective and extremely UNK STOP
START no need to kill an entire city and all its people because we lacked the precision and UNK to UNK UNK the UNK military force STOP
START our first necessity , at the very UNK of war , is UNK UNK STOP
START in a few years we will have UNK ( UNK missile observation system ) STOP
START but in the case of moving targets , and targets which have limited UNK , what will their location be when it is time to destroy them ? ? STOP
START what targets have we successfully knocked out ? ? STOP
START a ballistic missile cannot , today , tell you if it was successful or UNK STOP
START what targets still remain to be hit ? ? STOP
START these crucial questions must be answered by UNK UNK STOP
START UNK will be hard put to see through clouds -- and to see in the dark STOP
START even if this is some day possible , there remains the UNK time of flight of a missile to its overseas target STOP
START if the target can change its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in the air on its way , the probability of the missile destroying the target is UNK reduced STOP
START UNK UNK is vital but only UNK UNK will allow us to UNK the war favorably STOP
START it would be UNK to have an aircraft to UNK that UNK UNK STOP
START it could operate under the clouds and perform infrared UNK through clouds and at night STOP
START it would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately destroy any targets it discovered -- no need to wait for a missile to come all the way from the united states with the chance that the target , if it were mobile , would be gone STOP
START a large aircraft , such as the UNK or UNK , could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small nuclear weapons STOP
START few people realize that one UNK of nuclear UNK power will create UNK UNK UNK at 100 feet STOP
START or put another way , the UNK missile site planned today could be destroyed by placing a UNK UNK ( 1 the size of those used in UNK and UNK ) within 100 to 200 feet of the target ! ! STOP
START it is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large yield nuclear weapons STOP
START today we have UNK radar which has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual buildings , UNK , UNK , separate UNK of bridges , etc STOP
START with these UNK `` eyes '' and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy , military forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage to urban areas STOP
START if we fail to develop the means to UNK down and destroy the UNK military force with extreme care and precision , and if war comes in spite of our most UNK desires for peace , our choice of alternatives will be truly UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK of UNK UNK UNK -- its UNK UNK and infectious UNK -- make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music UNK STOP
START but for students of musical forms and UNK UNK , the work presents its problems STOP
START since it requires only five players , it would seem to fall into the category of chamber music -- yet it calls for a double UNK , an instrument generally regarded as UNK STOP
START moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather than the conventional four of most UNK , and this gives the UNK a UNK or UNK flavor STOP
START the many and frequent performances of the UNK serve to emphasize the UNK nature of its writing STOP
START some UNK are of UNK dimensions , with the UNK given free UNK STOP
START other UNK present the music as an essentially UNK creation STOP
START in these readings , the double UNK is either kept UNK in the background , or it is UNK in UNK UNK -- the musical equivalent of a UNK in a china shop STOP
START recently i was struck UNK by the UNK approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening i UNK to no fewer than ten different performances STOP
START the occasion for this UNK : UNK UNK UNK in its `` great UNK of the century '' series of the UNK UNK version STOP
START let me say at the UNK that the music UNK as UNK on the last playing as it did on the first STOP
START whether considered alone or in relation to other UNK , UNK 40 is a UNK of prime importance STOP
START UNK UNK was one of the greatest UNK players of all time , and any UNK of his on this UNK is valuable STOP
START but UNK was a great teacher in addition to being a great UNK , and the fact that four of the ten UNK i UNK to are by UNK pupils ( UNK UNK , frank UNK , UNK UNK , and victor UNK ) also UNK light on the UNK UNK skills STOP
START certain UNK UNK are common to all five UNK UNK , most notably the `` UNK UNK '' ( which UNK from the conventional UNK in that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) STOP
START but the most impressive testimony to UNK distinction as a teacher is reflected by the UNK which marks each UNK approach as UNK his own STOP
START UNK emphasis on structural clarity , his UNK UNK UNK , and UNK intensity all tend to UNK his reading as a UNK one STOP
START yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , UNK , and UNK humanity STOP
START this is a UNK interpretation , but it is never UNK STOP
START and although UNK UNK UNK with excitement , it is UNK UNK to UNK dynamic UNK and phrase indications STOP
START the piano performance on this UNK is one that really demands a search for UNK STOP
START about the UNK UNK contribution i am less happy STOP
START i , for one , rather UNK that UNK didn't UNK with the UNK UNK , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good deal closer to this UNK UNK outlook than the style of the UNK group STOP
START from a technical UNK , the string playing is good , but the UNK UNK people fail to enter into the spirit of things here STOP
START the UNK , in particular , is very UNK with UNK and UNK , and his tone is UNK and UNK STOP
START the UNK recording offers rather UNK string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet STOP
START there is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` UNK '' movement , and i suspect that this is due to UNK UNK between sides of the original aj STOP
START turning to the more modern UNK , UNK ( london ) offers the most sophisticated UNK work STOP
START every detail in his interpretation has been UNK thought out , and of these i would especially UNK the UNK UNK touch the UNK brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with UNK musicians ) , and the UNK UNK throughout STOP
START some of UNK playing strikes me as UNK , however STOP
START why , for example , does he favor two UNK , rather than one , for the third movement ? ? STOP
START the UNK musicians from the UNK UNK are somewhat lacking in UNK , but their contribution is UNK and UNK STOP
START ( special UNK to the double UNK playing of UNK UNK : his UNK , UNK sound UNK a delightful UNK to the performance STOP
START ) STOP
START the UNK arts edition ( UNK ) is a model of UNK and organization STOP
START it is , moreover , a perfectly UNK UNK effort STOP
START but having lived with the UNK for some time now , i find the performance less exciting than either UNK or UNK ( whose UNK performance with the UNK UNK has still to be recorded ) and a good deal less filled with humor than UNK STOP
START UNK work is very much UNK to UNK , but the sound on his UNK UNK is dated , and you will have a hard time locating a copy of it STOP
START the UNK UNK UNK ( UNK ) and victor UNK UNK ( UNK victor ) UNK give us UNK string playing ( both in UNK style ) UNK by UNK piano playing STOP
START ( UNK has acquired some of UNK UNK manner , but his playing is of limited insight STOP
START ) UNK UNK ( westminster ) and UNK UNK ( UNK UNK ) are both UNK , UNK UNK , but rather UNK and UNK STOP
START UNK UNK , playing with a group of musicians from the UNK UNK , gives a UNK reading , in much the same vein as that of the UNK UNK STOP
START UNK has UNK him beautiful sound , and this UNK UNK ( it UNK for UNK ) is worthy of consideration STOP
START returning once again to the UNK UNK , i am UNK UNK by the UNK of this UNK musical penetration STOP
START here is truly a `` great recording of the century '' , and its UNK is by no means UNK by the fact that it is not quite perfect STOP
START this recording surely belongs in UNK collection STOP
START must records always sound like records ? ? STOP
START from the beginning of commercial recording , new UNK UNK to be UNK from the real thing have regularly been put in UNK STOP
START seen in perspective , many of these UNK have a genuine claim to be UNK STOP
START although lacking absolute UNK , they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for UNK of the original STOP
START on the basis of what they give us we can know how the young UNK UNK , appreciate the distinctive qualities of UNK under UNK UNK UNK , or sense the type of UNK UNK created in his years with the new york UNK STOP
START since the concept of high UNK became important some dozen years ago , the claims of technical improvements have UNK UNK STOP
START in many cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than UNK effects : the first hearing was UNK and the second UNK as the gap between sound and substance became UNK STOP
START other UNK with better claims to musical interest UNK UNK to acquire in time the status of UNK STOP
START if we return to them today , we have no difficulty UNK their UNK but we find them still UNK STOP
START records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music STOP
START this difference is made up of many factors STOP
START some of them are obvious , such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of UNK and social UNK STOP
START ( music often sounds best to me when i can dress UNK and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat STOP
START ) from the technical UNK , records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to UNK the true color , UNK , UNK , range , intensity , UNK , and pitch of the original STOP
START any UNK of one of these factors is UNK , although we generally use that word only for effects so UNK that they can be stated UNK on the basis of standard tests STOP
START yet it is the UNK of UNK , the fitting together of UNK UNK until the total reaches the UNK of our awareness , that makes records sound like records STOP
START the sound may be good ; ; STOP
START but if you know the real thing , you know that what you are hearing is only a UNK imitation STOP
START UNK new UNK second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one STOP
START like the recent UNK from london ( high UNK , UNK ) , it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than on creating UNK effects STOP
START because of this , only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK way to describe this release is to say that it UNK an interesting and effective steinberg performance with minimal UNK of its musical values STOP
START the engineering as such never UNK upon your consciousness STOP
START the effect of the recording is very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance STOP
START this absence of UNK UNK and UNK UNK not only produces greater UNK , but it UNK UNK UNK STOP
START a contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained STOP
START the orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the UNK UNK , UNK UNK , and other UNK UNK to playing STOP
START yet you feel the orchestra is near at hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with UNK from a good seat in an UNK perfect hall STOP
START command has achieved the ideal amount of UNK STOP
START the music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its full UNK ; ; STOP
START yet the hall never UNK as a UNK STOP
START the UNK remains that of the instruments UNK by resonance STOP
START all of this would be UNK , of course , if the performance lacked authority and musical distinction STOP
START for me it has more of both elements than the majority of its UNK STOP
START steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score , UNK tradition , and has built his performance on the intention to UNK as UNK as possible exactly what UNK set down on paper STOP
START those UNK to broader , more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one STOP
START without losing the distinctive UNK of UNK rhythm , the UNK is firm and the over-all performance has a UNK UNK quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect STOP
START the UNK UNK UNK UNK of the first UNK of the UNK is taken literally and may shock you , as the real UNK UNK UNK of the UNK is likely to bring you to your feet STOP
START in the end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it UNK STOP
START steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the UNK element which must UNK in this score , and he UNK at times to create the effect of the whole orchestra UNK into song STOP
START the engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result STOP
START too many records seem to reduce a work of UNK UNK to a melody and its UNK STOP
START the command technique UNK you to listen to the depth of the UNK STOP
START your ear takes you into the UNK , and you may well become aware of UNK details which previously were apparent only in the score STOP
START it is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high UNK of real musical significance for the home music UNK STOP
START the first substantially complete UNK UNK ( and the only one of its scope since UNK UNK UNK edition of 1958 for UNK ) , this set is , i'm afraid , likely to provide more UNK UNK than enjoyment STOP
START the already UNK UNK UNK of the naive music itself UNK entirely in UNK UNK UNK between UNK UNK power and UNK , if UNK , UNK STOP
START and in its UNK UNK attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and UNK UNK , the recording sounds as though it had been `` UNK for UNK UNK '' STOP
START the home UNK is UNK , all right , but the experience is a far from pleasant one STOP
START as with the UNK UNK release ( UNK UNK for UNK victor ) i find the UNK , less UNK UNK version , for all its lack of UNK UNK , the more UNK UNK -- but this may be the result of processing defects in my UNK copies STOP
START at the westminster UNK dog show in madison square garden , new york on the second day , the UNK of the junior class brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this class STOP
START the class had entries from as far west as wisconsin and as far south as UNK STOP
START this year several entries from canada were entered which made the junior class international STOP
START UNK of the UNK juniors who mailed in entries were present STOP
START it was interesting to note that many of these juniors were showing dogs in various other classes at the show prior to the UNK of the junior class STOP
START as has been the custom for the past several years , john cross , jr, bench show UNK westminster , arranged for the UNK meeting before the class , and invited two UNK from the dog world to address them STOP
START over 60 juniors , parents and guests attended STOP
START UNK UNK , UNK STOP
START after the juniors were UNK and UNK for UNK for the UNK of the junior class , UNK UNK , UNK introduced as the first speaker STOP
START in her opening remarks UNK also UNK the juniors and stated , `` there isn't any other show quite like westminster STOP
START i know because this is my UNK year with hardly a break STOP
START UNK still feels the same unique spirit of westminster which she stated the present juniors will experience today but probably will not appreciate in full for a number of years STOP
START twenty years ago her daughter UNK long , then 13 years of age , won the grand challenge UNK , children's handling class ( as they were called then ) at westminster STOP
START no UNK had UNK come out of the ring than UNK walked into the working competition with UNK or UNK , another UNK product , and won ! ! STOP
START speaking from long years of experience , UNK advised the juniors : `` when showing dogs UNK to be fun and excitement , stop ! ! STOP
START dogs have a way of UNK our feelings ! ! STOP
START when you and your dog step into the junior ring , it should be just what the dog wants to do as much as what you want him to do STOP
START if you walk into the ring because it is fun to show your dog , he will feel it and give you a good performance ! ! STOP
START he knows your signals , what is expected of him and the way the class is conducted , right up through the UNK of the UNK '' STOP
START right attitude essential ! ! STOP
START `` take away your attitude '' , said UNK , `` and what have you left ? ? STOP
START either a UNK dog because you are UNK with UNK -- a sure sign that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop ! ! STOP
START or a UNK dog because you are more interested in something else -- maybe the way you look , or the date you have after the class , or you are just doing this to please the parents STOP
START `` the reason you are in the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most attractive picture of your dog that the UNK use of your aids can produce STOP
START aids sounds more like a UNK club , or UNK classes -- riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar ! ! STOP
START `` your aids are your attitude , which comes through your voice , your hands and legs -- voice to encourage , UNK or whatever the need may be ; ; STOP
START hands to guide or UNK ; ; STOP
START legs to produce motion and rate of speed STOP
START without right attitude the other aids just do not work right '' STOP
START UNK wished all the juniors luck in the class and stated , `` have fun ! ! STOP
START and may you all continue to show at westminster in the years to come '' ! ! STOP
START UNK UNK , second speaker STOP
START the second speaker was UNK UNK , president of the dog writers UNK of america STOP
START UNK spoke on the subject of UNK for juniors -- with which he is very familiar STOP
START last year a boy he knows and helped in UNK won the UNK UNK UNK scholarship which is worth UNK STOP
START he gave a UNK of the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship STOP
START `` junior UNK is an extremely worthy project and should be UNK encouraged '' ! ! STOP
START is one of UNK strong beliefs STOP
START he feels very UNK that the american UNK club should take a more active part in encouraging the junior division ! ! STOP
START in UNK , UNK also wished all the juniors luck in their class STOP
START westminster show notes STOP
START instead of 3 UNK the past , the juniors class at westminster was held at UNK UNK STOP
START this gave the juniors the use of the entire ring at the show -- a great advantage to them ! ! STOP
START before the juniors entered the ring the UNK announced that after all juniors had moved their dogs around the ring and set them up , they could relax with their dogs STOP
START from there on , each junior was going to be judged individually STOP
START this UNK gesture was well received by the juniors as the class had an entry of UNK juniors and it took approximately one hour , UNK minutes to judge the class STOP
START UNK UNK UNK judges UNK UNK STOP
START this year UNK UNK UNK , outstanding UNK , judged the class STOP
START this is the third time in UNK years of junior UNK at westminster that a lady UNK has judged the class STOP
START as the juniors entered the ring , UNK , the UNK , stated over the UNK system that this was the UNK year that westminster has held the UNK of the junior competition STOP
START juniors UNK last year at american UNK club and UNK UNK club , recognized shows to be UNK to compete in this class -- the UNK for the year STOP
START a junior who won two or more UNK in the open class was UNK STOP
START ( the purpose of the junior UNK competition is to teach and encourage juniors to become good UNK STOP
START many adults showing at westminster today are products of this class STOP
START ) STOP
START it seemed an almost impossible job for miss UNK to select 4 UNK from the UNK juniors entered STOP
START a large number of these juniors have 7 and 8 UNK to their credit and are UNK UNK STOP
START after the judge moved all the dogs individually , she selected several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring STOP
START she then went over them thoroughly giving each a UNK test in UNK STOP
START international UNK of the year STOP
START UNK UNK UNK , age 16 , UNK , UNK showing an irish UNK , was chosen as international UNK of the year STOP
START she was awarded the professional UNK UNK UNK UNK , UNK UNK ( named for the UNK of the junior classes STOP
START ) STOP
START UNK is 16 years of age and had several UNK to her credit last year STOP
START in addition to showing an irish UNK throughout the year , she also UNK with an UNK STOP
START other UNK STOP
START UNK UNK UNK , age 15 , UNK island , UNK showing a UNK UNK , was UNK STOP
START UNK UNK , age 14 , from baltimore , UNK showing a UNK , was UNK STOP
START last year UNK also placed UNK in the UNK at westminster STOP
START from the records we keep -- UNK is the only junior who has placed in the junior classes in both united states and canada STOP
START UNK UNK , age 16 , UNK , UNK showing a UNK was UNK STOP
START most juniors who were entered in the UNK are UNK UNK and not only show and win in junior classes but score in the breed classes as well STOP
START entries increasing -- requirements raised STOP
START in 1960 , there were UNK entries in the junior classes STOP
START each year these shows have increased in entries STOP
START next year 1962 , at westminster , the bench show committee has raised the requirements so that a junior must win 3 or more junior classes in the open division only to UNK for westminster STOP
START UNK UNK , a leading judge will not be at the international show this year for the junior UNK contest as he has been invited to judge in UNK in march STOP
START UNK class for UNK proposed STOP
START it has been suggested many times that a class be set up for the juniors who are UNK and cannot enter the junior classes STOP
START for some time this writer has been UNK a junior UNK class for UNK over 16 and under 20 years of age who are UNK to compete in the junior class STOP
START such a class was tried out successfully at the UNK UNK show recently STOP
START not only were the UNK pleased with the class , but it aroused the interest of all in UNK that day STOP
START the UNK in the class with the judge were asked to pick 4 UNK and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice of the judge STOP
START we suggested this class in the horse world and it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows STOP
START at the recent horse show convention in new york it was stated that this intermediate UNK class is meeting with great success and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world STOP
START this class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given a chance STOP
START last year robert UNK , a leading junior UNK entered the dog UNK contest ( junior ) at the international UNK of chicago show and had the highest score in UNK of any junior since the UNK UNK STOP
START juniors who attend this chicago show should make a point to enter this class as it would be of great help to them STOP
START more UNK UNK needed to judge STOP
START UNK at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a UNK UNK to judge junior UNK competition STOP
START the UNK of the junior UNK competition the late UNK UNK , UNK for whom the UNK is named after at westminster ) was an outstanding UNK and believed a junior should have an opportunity to exhibit in a dog show starting with the junior UNK division STOP
START some years ago this class was judged by UNK who knew nothing of what was required of a UNK ability to show a dog STOP
START to overcome this UNK UNK , the UNK that a UNK UNK be present to judge the class STOP
START if the UNK do not receive more cooperation from UNK , it has been suggested that UNK judges also be qualified to judge this class STOP
START by UNK and helping juniors get interested in the dog world , all will be helping to create future dog owners STOP
START other awards for juniors STOP
START the UNK UNK club of america and the UNK blue UNK club of america have under consideration UNK UNK to the boys or girls who win with their UNK in junior UNK competition at any show STOP
START the kansas city and the UNK UNK are UNK that juniors who win at their shows will be qualified to win points for westminster STOP
START the UNK UNK UNK is also considering having their junior classes set up so that juniors can UNK with points for westminster STOP
START the american UNK club is still continuing to UNK UNK to juniors who win at junior UNK classes with UNK STOP
START traveling through the south -- over UNK miles -- with two great UNK , an UNK , and a UNK UNK , UNK worked up a regular routine for acceptance at UNK STOP
START my husband enters the UNK office , signs up for a room , and then UNK UNK the UNK if he UNK UNK STOP
START `` UNK '' ? ? STOP
START comes the UNK question STOP
START `` no '' , he UNK , `` full grown , adult show dogs , UNK , and UNK '' STOP
START UNK never been refused ! ! STOP
START once settled , UNK careful to walk the dogs in an out of the way spot , keep them under control in the room , and feed and bench them where they can't do any UNK to the UNK or the furniture STOP
START in the morning we leave the room looking as UNK as a UNK ! ! STOP
START many a UNK owner -- when UNK stopped there again -- has remembered us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children STOP
START so many times i have UNK why UNK do not UNK the table clean before each new UNK patient is placed on it for examination STOP
START is it that they don't care ? ? STOP
START are they UNK to the fact that the dog can easily pick up UNK from the preceding patient ? ? STOP
START at one time , to most americans , unless they were fortunate enough to live near a body of UNK water , boats were considered the UNK concern of UNK , rich people , and the united states navy STOP
START today the UNK boating scene is UNK with UNK statistics which prove the enormous growth of that UNK STOP
START there are more than UNK UNK boats in use in the united states with almost UNK the UNK for within the next decade STOP
START about UNK people UNK in boating in 1960 STOP
START boating has become a UNK whose UNK cover the entire nation from sea to UNK sea STOP
START boats are operated in every state in the union , with the UNK UNK along both UNK and in the middle west STOP
START the spectacular UNK in pleasure boating is UNK evident , UNK , in the areas where boats have always been found : the natural UNK , rivers , and along the nation's UNK STOP
START but during the last several years boats were launched in areas where , a short time ago , the only water to be found was in UNK and UNK UNK for livestock STOP
START developed as a result of the UNK resources control program of the government , vast , UNK bodies of water represent a kind of UNK UNK benefit , providing boating and fishing UNK all over the country STOP
START no matter how determined or UNK boating UNK of the southwest had been , for example , they could never have created anything approaching the fifty UNK lake UNK , located between texas and UNK , which resulted when the UNK of army engineers UNK the red river STOP
START in 1959 , according to the engineers , lake UNK was only one of UNK artificial UNK and UNK which were used for recreation by over UNK persons STOP
START where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been created by bringing bodies of water to the people , means have been found to take the people and their boats to the water STOP
START providing these means are about ninety companies which UNK the estimated UNK boat trailers now in use STOP
START it is a simple task to UNK a boat fifty or one hundred miles to a lake or UNK on the new , light , strong , UNK trailers which are built to UNK almost any kind of small boat and retail from UNK to UNK STOP
START the sight of UNK UNK , UNK , and UNK being UNK UNK along UNK many miles from any water is commonplace STOP
START UNK UNK enough to have facilities for UNK UNK for their UNK , will recall the UNK procedure of UNK their gear into the car , driving to the water , and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to the boat STOP
START today , the boat , on its UNK , is brought to the gear and loaded at the door STOP
START arriving at the UNK , the boat is launched , the family taken aboard and , that easily , another day UNK is begun STOP
START and trailers for boats are not what they started out to be ten years ago STOP
START this year , americans will discover previously UNK of UNK in trailers that will be UNK in about one hundred of our nation's national , regional and local boat shows STOP
START the boats of america's UNK UNK in 1961 will be UNK on clouds as they are UNK to new UNK STOP
START the variety of UNK on the UNK waters today is overwhelming STOP
START they range from an UNK UNK , which you can build yourself for less than UNK , to UNK UNK which can cost over UNK STOP
START boat prices vary according to the UNK desires or needs STOP
START in this respect , boats can be compared with houses STOP
START there is no limit to what you can spend , yet it is easily possible to keep within a set budget STOP
START there is no question as to just what is available STOP
START you name it , our industry is producing it , and it probably is made in different models STOP
START there are UNK ideal for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips STOP

START you may order utility models , UNK or UNK , with or without UNK , UNK , and bunks STOP
START you may dress it up with any number of UNK or keep it as simple as you choose STOP
START designers and manufacturers have produced models for UNK who run the UNK from a UNK version of the UNK UNK lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her UNK ride around the block , to the UNK UNK who UNK on all the UNK , color , UNK and speed possible to UNK in a single boat STOP

START american technology in engine and UNK design is largely responsible for the UNK interest in american boating STOP
START i wonder if anyone ever UNK to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors , americans UNK over any country in the world in the long run STOP
START russia , whose technology is not quite primitive , is still in the dark ages when it comes to UNK the UNK motor , for instance STOP
START now here is truly a UNK STOP
START the UNK engine of today has a UNK range of one to UNK UNK , UNK of a few years ago for a two cycle engine in quantity production STOP
START these engines can be removed from a boat with relative ease , UNK lies their greatest advantage STOP
START their cost is not beyond the hopes of the american UNK , the range being about UNK to UNK , depending on size STOP
START great thought has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population of the country ; ; STOP
START and to making the UNK of a boat simpler STOP
START there was a time when , if a man wanted to purchase a boat , it was necessary for him to be able to produce a UNK amount of cash before he could touch the UNK or wheel STOP
START having a boat financed through a local bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended STOP
START marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in UNK areas UNK in UNK you to UNK now and pay later STOP
START terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down payments run about the same as for automobiles STOP
START of course , individual financing arrangements depend a good deal on the UNK UNK power , credit UNK and local bank policy STOP
START UNK motors , insurance , and boat UNK may also be financed in the same way as boats STOP
START terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those for home UNK STOP
START when the automobile was in its UNK stage , such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the UNK understanding that horses should not be UNK UNK being about the only rule governing where , when and how fast a car could go STOP
START when air travel was in its UNK , the sky was considered big enough and high enough for all STOP
START man had enough to worry about UNK to get up there and stay without being UNK with rules once UNK STOP
START it was much the same with pleasure boating at first STOP

START as the UNK days of the automobile and the UNK are long since UNK to the past , so is the UNK attitude toward what a UNK may and may not do ; ; STOP
START must and should do STOP
START however , there is a minimum of legislative UNK on boating STOP
START laws on boating vary according to the state in which the UNK is to be used and according to its UNK STOP
START what may be acceptable in one state may be strictly UNK across the boundary line STOP
START the main requirement is to be sure the boat is UNK according to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be UNK used STOP
START if your state has no provisions for the UNK of pleasure boats , you must apply for a number from the UNK guard for any kind of boat with mechanical UNK UNK at more than 10 UNK before it can be used on federal UNK STOP
START state UNK laws differ from each other in many ways STOP
START fees are not the same and some states do not require certain UNK , such as UNK with no power , to be registered at all STOP
START many states have laws UNK the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age of motor boat operators STOP
START generally , states reserve for communities the right to have local UNK UNK speed and other activities STOP
START it is always wise to UNK your marine dealer , local UNK or boat club secretary , or local law enforcement officers if you are not positive what the regulations are STOP
START ignorance of the law is no better UNK on the water than it is on land ; ; STOP
START lack of ability and common sense can lead to just as much tragedy STOP
START hand in hand with the legislative program is the industry's self UNK and directed safety program STOP
START UNK the possible UNK to safety with the rapid growth of the UNK , the industry has been supporting an intense , coordinated educational program with great success since 1947 STOP
START a primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers STOP
START the industry has been its own watch dog STOP
START with UNK guard cooperation , the american boat and UNK council was formed to develop recommended practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference to safety STOP
START industry interest in safety goes even farther STOP
START in 1959 , the UNK safety bureau was UNK by the national association of engine and boat manufacturers and a group of insurance UNK to provide a testing laboratory and UNK service for boats and their equipment STOP
START a new UNK site for the bureau is now being built at atlantic city , new UNK , to provide the most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the UNK safe STOP
START in addition to these activities , the UNK , with headquarters at UNK UNK avenue , new york city , as well as other associations and individual manufacturers , provide and UNK films , UNK , and public services in regard to proper boat handling and safety UNK STOP
START it is important to note the work of the united states power UNK and the UNK guard UNK STOP
START each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in UNK UNK and small boat handling STOP
START these are not UNK UNK organizations STOP
START this year , over UNK persons will receive this free instruction STOP
START as america on UNK was responsible for an industry of motor courts , UNK , and UNK UNK where you can UNK , see a movie , shop , or make a bank UNK , the UNK number of boating UNK have UNK industries designed especially to UNK them STOP
START instead of UNK , for the UNK there are UNK STOP
START the word UNK was UNK by UNK originally to describe a UNK UNK where UNK boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative comfort STOP
START currently , UNK is used to indicate a municipal or UNK operated UNK where a pleasure boat may UNK and find some or all of the following available : UNK , fresh water , electricity , telephone service , ice , UNK facilities , UNK , sleeping UNK , a general store , and a UNK store STOP
START UNK , a relatively new word , indicates a UNK type of hotel where a UNK may UNK and find overnight UNK on the UNK as well as other services STOP
START UNK has a similar meaning to UNK STOP
START it indicates the same thing but it is meant to UNK more specifically to UNK designed to UNK to smaller type boats such as UNK STOP
START regardless of UNK , UNK and UNK are UNK STOP
START UNK which also provide some of the above facilities may UNK be called UNK STOP
START a recent survey UNK there are about UNK UNK and UNK operated UNK and UNK in the united states , the majority of which are equipped to handle UNK boats STOP
START the design of a mechanical UNK frame is much like a mechanical UNK , but once understood , the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement STOP
START in the frame are two sets of bars which UNK with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves STOP
START the main set of bars are the `` tappets '' and one tappet is connected to each lever STOP
START if the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch , the tappet moves a short distance UNK at the same time STOP
START close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking bars STOP
START these can also move a short distance but at right UNK to the tappets STOP
START the number of locking bars required depends on how many false moves must be prevented STOP
START in the sides of the tappets are UNK with UNK sides , and connection between the tappets and locking bars consist of UNK called `` dogs '' STOP
START two or more dogs are mounted on each locking bar STOP
START these slide into and out of the UNK in the tappets as the tappets are moved , locking and UNK them STOP
START UNK how the scheme works : suppose the operator UNK the lever to clear a particular signal STOP
START this also UNK the tappet connected to the particular lever and forces any dogs UNK in the UNK to the side , thus moving one or more locking bars STOP
START the dogs on the other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into UNK in other tappets STOP
START by this scheme , UNK one signal to clear UNK all the other switch and signal UNK in safe positions until the first signal is again UNK to normal STOP
START UNK signals are normally at stop or `` red '' position , and a lever must be pulled to `` clear '' the signal STOP
START this is not necessarily to green , however , for in some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it into the `` plant '' STOP
START there are other basic rules STOP
START a UNK may have two UNK , one to actually move the switch points , the other to UNK the points STOP
START a signal cannot be UNK until all the related UNK are properly thrown and locked STOP
START such UNK are nearly always used where the switch points `` face '' UNK traffic STOP
START the UNK UNK that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that a wheel UNK will UNK on a partly thrown point STOP
START if the points aren't thrown all the way , the UNK cannot be locked , and in turn , the signal cannot be UNK STOP
START generally , these UNK on UNK are called `` facing point UNK '' STOP
START UNK show typical arrangements of track and signals STOP
START each UNK is accompanied by a `` dog chart '' , a list of the UNK that show which other UNK any particular lever will UNK if pulled STOP
START the lines UNK the UNK dogs represent the locking bars at right UNK to the tappet bars STOP
START by studying the UNK UNK you'll note several other details STOP
START UNK -- mechanical track devices that actually guide the UNK off the UNK if a train passes a `` stop '' signal -- are used in many instances STOP
START `` home '' signals have two UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK indicate a fixed aspect -- the UNK does not move STOP
START as an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal is seen in advance when he passes the `` distant '' signal located beyond the limits of the UNK plant STOP
START in some UNK situations , the distant signal is fixed at caution STOP
START in other instances where there is no automatic block UNK , the distant has only green and yellow aspects STOP
START so much for the UNK STOP

START ( see fig7 STOP
START ) put a UNK UNK screw into the hole , cut off the excess UNK and file UNK with the UNK of the bar STOP
START to find the other stop screw position , insert the tappet into the frame and hold the screw head UNK against the frame edge STOP
START UNK a line across the bar on the other end of the tappet , 1 '' plus half the diameter of the UNK screw head ( about 5 '' ) away from the frame edge STOP
START total distance is about 21 '' STOP
START tend to make this UNK slightly UNK so you can file the screw head to get exactly 1 '' tappet movement STOP
START drill a UNK hole , tap UNK and insert a UNK UNK screw as you did on the first end STOP

START to each tappet except 6 and 8 , UNK a af piece of UNK and file to the UNK shape shown in UNK and 8 STOP
START these will serve as UNK UNK for the electrical contacts STOP
START fitting the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather UNK job since stop UNK , tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced many times STOP
START as the work UNK the frame and moving parts become a sort of chinese UNK where several pieces must be removed before the part you are working on is UNK STOP
START a little extra work here will pay off with a smooth , UNK machine when you are finished STOP
START each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work UNK to insure UNK fitting STOP
START the order of fitting is not too important STOP
START however , we started with the first row of bars and worked our way back STOP

START scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics STOP
START without UNK the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go UNK would not have any means of UNK , UNK , and UNK the things they discover and learn STOP
START UNK and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are , therefore , essential to any scientific UNK STOP
START hot UNK is a science STOP
START it's not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth UNK on its axis or building a UNK or putting a UNK into orbit but it is , nevertheless , a science STOP
START but because science is based on mathematics doesn't mean that a hot UNK must necessarily be a UNK STOP
START a UNK can be an active and successful hot UNK for years without becoming even UNK involved with mathematical problems ; ; STOP
START however , he will have a UNK understanding of what he is doing and the UNK are he will be more successful if he UNK the few formulas that apply to UNK STOP
START a mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for UNK a specific problem STOP
START it places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can be computed STOP
START the first step in using a formula is to insert the numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula STOP
START this changes the formula to an `` equation '' STOP
START the equation is used for the mathematical process of UNK the problem STOP
START UNK for UNK formulas are not complicated STOP
START they involve only simple mathematics that are taught in UNK school UNK classes STOP
START however , it is essential that the various mathematical symbols used in the UNK be understood so that the mathematical processes can be done properly and in their correct order STOP
START they indicate simple division , UNK , UNK , and addition STOP
START the symbol for division is a straight line that UNK two numbers placed one above the other STOP
START the lower number is always divided into the upper number : af STOP
START STOP
START the symbol for UNK is `` UNK '' STOP
START it is used to separate two or more numbers in a row STOP
START for example : af STOP
START numbers to be UNK together may be UNK in any order STOP
START the result will be the same regardless of the order used STOP
START the symbol for UNK is the standard UNK sign STOP
START this is nothing more than a UNK STOP
START it UNK two or more numbers STOP
START the number on the right of the symbol is always UNK from the number on the left of the symbol STOP
START for example : af STOP
START when more than two figures are separated by UNK symbols the UNK must be carried out from the left to right if the result is to be correct STOP
START for example , for the problem af , 10 from 25 UNK 15 , then 6 from 15 UNK 9 STOP
START addition is indicated by the UNK symbol STOP
START the symbol is used to separate two or more numbers STOP
START for example : af STOP
START numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed in any order STOP
START when UNK an equation that involves division as well as other steps , do all the division steps first to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical value STOP
START UNK , UNK , and addition can then be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left end of the equation and working toward the right STOP
START UNK the division first also includes those division parts that require UNK , UNK , or addition steps : af STOP
START this would be reduced by UNK 8 times 6 and then UNK the product by 12 STOP
START this part of the equation would then become 4 STOP
START for use in formulas , fractions should be converted to their UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK way to do this is with a conversion chart STOP
START UNK for this purpose are available from many sources STOP
START they are included in all types of mathematical UNK and they are UNK on some types of precision measuring instruments STOP
START the various mathematical processes can be UNK by carrying the results to only two or three UNK places STOP
START UNK the results in this manner will not have any UNK effect on the accuracy of the final result STOP
START some formulas contain `` UNK '' STOP
START a constant is a number that remains the same regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant equation STOP
START it is a number without which the equation cannot be solved correctly STOP
START UNK formulas apply to many phases of the UNK STOP
START the answers they give can often UNK the way to performance increases and , quite often , are necessary for UNK entry UNK for different events STOP
START when it is needed , one formula is as important as another STOP
START however , some formulas are used more than others STOP
START UNK take them in the general order of their popularity STOP
START engine displacement STOP
START a UNK should be able to UNK the displacement of his engine STOP
START displacement is sometimes referred to as `` swept volume '' STOP
START most entry UNK for competitive events require engine displacement information because of class restrictions STOP
START it is good to be able to UNK displacement so that changes in it resulting from UNK and UNK can be computed STOP
START factors involved in the displacement formula are the bore diameter of the UNK UNK , the length of the UNK UNK , the number of UNK in the engine , and a constant STOP
START the constant is , which is UNK of UNK , another constant known as `` UNK '' STOP
START UNK is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions of circles STOP
START actually , the engine displacement formula is the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type with an added factor that represents the number of UNK in the engine STOP
START the UNK area of the UNK is determined and then the volume of the individual UNK is computed by UNK the area by the UNK length , which is the equivalent of the length of the UNK STOP
START UNK the result by the number of UNK in the engine gives the UNK total displacement STOP
START the formula is : af STOP
START dimensions in inches , and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches STOP
START dimensions in UNK and fractions of UNK will give the displacement in cubic UNK ( UNK STOP
START one inch UNK UNK UNK : one cubic inch UNK UNK cubic UNK STOP
START for example , UNK consider a standard UNK cubic inch UNK aj STOP
START these engines have a cylinder diameter of UNK inches and a UNK length of 3 inches STOP
START the formula , with the fractions converted to UNK , becomes af STOP
START to arrive at the answer , UNK the numbers together by starting at the left of the group and working to the right STOP
START the different steps will look like this : af STOP
START STOP
START UNK ratio STOP
START a UNK UNK ratio is computed by UNK the UNK volume , or its displacement , with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber STOP
START cylinder volume can be determined UNK but combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid STOP
START cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula : af STOP
START to measure the volume of one of the combustion UNK in the cylinder head , UNK the UNK and UNK plug in the chamber and support the head so that its UNK surface is level STOP
START then UNK water or light oil from a UNK UNK into the chamber to fill the chamber to its UNK surface STOP
START do not UNK the chamber STOP
START this is possible with water and other UNK that have a high surface tension STOP
START such UNK will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber STOP
START the amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by UNK the quantity still in the UNK when the chamber is full from the original quantity STOP
START most UNK are UNK in cubic UNK ( UNK , making it necessary to UNK the result to cubic inches STOP
START however , the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic UNK STOP
START the UNK ratio arrived at with the formula will be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic UNK are used STOP
START the only UNK is that all volumes used in the formula be quoted in the same terms STOP
START the volume of the cylinder opening in the head UNK must be computed by UNK its area in square inches by the UNK thickness in UNK of an inch STOP
START sometimes it is necessary to roughly UNK the square inch area of the opening but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it won't affect the final UNK STOP
START the volume of the opening is added to the combustion chamber volume STOP
START another thing that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between the top of the UNK and the top of the cylinder block when the UNK is in top dead center position STOP
START UNK this volume by measuring the distance from the top of the block to the UNK head as accurately as possible with a depth UNK or some other precision measuring device and then UNK the area of the cylinder by the depth STOP
START the formula for this step is : af STOP
START this volume is added to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head UNK opening STOP
START the total of these three volumes is the `` final combustion chamber volume '' STOP
START after the factors just described have been computed , they are applied to the following formula : af STOP
START STOP
START for an example UNK dream up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic inches and a cylinder volume of UNK cubic inches STOP
START applying these figures to the formula we get the equation : af STOP
START the UNK ratio is 10 to 1 STOP
START this method of computing UNK ratio cannot be used accurately for engines that have UNK with either UNK or UNK shaped heads STOP
START any UNK on the UNK heads will make it impossible , with normal means , to determine the final combustion chamber volume because the volume UNK by the UNK heads cannot be readily computed STOP
START the only way to determine the final combustion chamber volume when such UNK are used is by measuring it with liquid while the cylinder head is UNK to the cylinder block and the UNK is in top dead center position STOP
START gear ratio -- speed relationships STOP
START there are four UNK of the formula that involves the relationships of car speed , engine speed , rear UNK gear ratio , and rear tire size STOP
START by using the appropriate version any one of these factors can be determined for any combination of the other three STOP
START to UNK the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of the factors STOP
START these are STOP
START UNK for car speed STOP
START , for engine UNK speed STOP
START , for rear UNK gear ratio STOP
START , for tire size STOP
START STOP
START tire size can be determined in several ways but the one that is the UNK and as accurate as any is by measuring the effective UNK of a wheel and tire assembly STOP
START this is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire is UNK to the center of the rear UNK UNK STOP
START a tire must be UNK to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to its operating weight when this measurement is made STOP
START the measurement must be in inches STOP
START any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted to a UNK equivalent to UNK the mathematics STOP
START when tire size is measured in this manner a constant of UNK is used in the formula STOP
START to determine car speed for a given combination of engine speed , gear ratio , and tire size , the formula is : af STOP
START for an engine speed of UNK UNK , a gear ratio of UNK to 1 , and a tire UNK of 13 inches , the equation would look like this : af STOP
START STOP
START to determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three factors the formula is : af STOP
START using the same figures as for the previous example , the equation becomes : af STOP

START well , if you're that kind of UNK UNK here to help you STOP
START you've probably given a lot of UNK thought to the guns in your UNK , but it's not easy to decide on a new one STOP
START you still have time to drop a few UNK about the UNK UNK appreciate most ; ; STOP
START the time to decide on them is now STOP
START as a christmas service , i've taken a close look at this year's crop of new models STOP
START here they are , with my comments and judgments STOP
START read on , take your pick -- and start UNK those UNK STOP
START first on my own list would be two arms -- a rifle and a UNK -- that UNK as new in the UNK sense STOP
START for me , a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn't constitute a truly new design STOP
START such UNK are all for the best but it takes something as different as a UNK or a jet to change UNK concepts STOP
START bill UNK UNK UNK ( under UNK ) is a new rifle action in a UNK that UNK all the modern theory of UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START it's a short , light , UNK , UNK little timber gun designed to push a heavy UNK at UNK velocity but with lots of UNK power and ample range for our most popular big game -- UNK STOP
START UNK reports that on his recent african UNK the little UNK UNK was a real work horse STOP
START small UNK were generally UNK with one shot , and the UNK UNK also UNK UNK , UNK and wart UNK with deadly efficiency ; ; STOP
START these are fairly large , tough animals STOP
START the UNK of the UNK in a rifle comes as no surprise to me STOP
START at least five years ago , tom robinson of UNK made up an over double rifle for me in this UNK , using the now UNK model UNK action in UNK size STOP
START after UNK out how to UNK the UNK so that they shot to the same point of impact , we fired this little UNK job on my home range and in UNK underground test UNK STOP
START we quickly ran into the same trouble that UNK bill UNK in his first experiments : three or four bullets would be placed well in a UNK UNK at 100 yards and then , UNK , one could UNK far out of the group STOP
START UNK learned that this was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was UNK the shape of the UNK UNK bullet STOP
START the new , UNK UNK in UNK UNK this STOP
START but even without UNK bullets , i had enough faith in my double to take it on an UNK UNK UNK that first year STOP
START within half an hour i UNK a UNK UNK that UNK through a UNK UNK , and i caught him just behind the left UNK at 60 yards STOP
START he moved only about 30 feet after the UNK UNK hit him -- and this was after the bullet had passed through a UNK STOP
START three more UNK have fallen to this same gun , and all were UNK UNK STOP
START my double was made with UNK UNK UNK ( before cutting to UNK length ) , and although it UNK well in other respects , it's considerably UNK than the UNK , which only UNK about UNK pounds STOP
START if ever a rifle met the needs of the UNK UNK , this is it STOP
START the UNK points with the ease , speed and precision of a fine UNK double UNK , and its UNK pull is light and sharp STOP
START the UNK bullet leaves the UNK at UNK UNK , which gives it all the UNK needed at woods UNK STOP
START with five UNK at the immediate command of the UNK UNK finger , the gun and load are a deadly combination STOP
START the second really new development this year was a UNK handling a different sort of UNK load -- the STOP
START UNK jet UNK center fire STOP
START at present it's available in one model , the fine and familiar smith & UNK UNK UNK ( about UNK ) , long a UNK UNK among target arms STOP
START the velocity of this STOP
START , UNK bullet is UNK at a very hot UNK UNK , and it's the UNK shooting of any UNK UNK , with a UNK rise of about an inch over a UNK range STOP
START this is a UNK load , pure and simple ; ; STOP
START it's much too UNK for small UNK game STOP
START it can cut a red UNK UNK in two or burst a UNK into a UNK of UNK STOP
START the most UNK aspect of the s & UNK UNK UNK for the new jet is that it can also fire standard STOP
START UNK by means of UNK UNK in the UNK STOP
START you may therefore UNK the gun into a UNK and UNK arm , although the difference in the point of impact ( jet UNK ) can be somewhat UNK STOP
START the accuracy of the jet UNK is fine ; ; STOP
START i tested it in my UNK s & UNK and it was good enough to allow me to hit a UNK with every shot at 100 yards if i did my part by holding the UNK steadily STOP
START hunting UNK , UNK STOP
START the fact that the UNK and the jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models , actions and UNK STOP
START aside from the UNK UNK , a number of hunting UNK have been introduced for the first time STOP
START here are the UNK ( in UNK order ) and the new models STOP
START UNK to the american UNK are the UNK group of UNK , UNK UNK STOP
START they have fine UNK actions and a UNK finish on both the metal and the stock wood STOP
START barrel weights vary UNK with the various UNK available , and these include the standard UNK ( about UNK ) plus the UNK ( around UNK ) ; ; STOP
START the latter include the STOP
START , s & h , , and STOP
START UNK UNK UNK UNK are standard on all of the UNK except the STOP

START , af and the UNK , the long action ( about UNK for the standard UNK and UNK for the custom version ) STOP
START previously , UNK actions were used for the larger UNK STOP
START high standard has introduced a STOP
START auto , the UNK , in two grades -- field and special ( less than UNK and just over UNK , respectively ) STOP
START it's a UNK rifle , fast and UNK STOP
START among STOP
START UNK UNK UNK , UNK UNK UNK was the UNK model UNK UNK ( around UNK ) STOP
START previously known as jefferson arms , UNK has given this UNK UNK job an UNK fine stock design , and the UNK is the first UNK to handle STOP
START UNK UNK STOP
START UNK has made two contributions to the UNK of new UNK STOP
START the model UNK ( under UNK ) is a UNK , UNK STOP
START UNK auto with a UNK magazine that holds 18 long UNK STOP
START it's extremely accurate for an auto , and the test rifle i tried was completely UNK in UNK STOP
START the UNK ( about UNK ) is an even newer STOP
START auto , this one with a UNK or UNK UNK STOP
START once again the UNK UNK UNK has appeared , but this time as a UNK UNK combination STOP
START the bore is UNK but is provided with an insert tube which is UNK and which , surprisingly , gives pretty fair accuracy even though it's only UNK inches long STOP
START you can UNK this tube and replace it with a UNK insert for use with STOP
START UNK -- to break the little UNK clay targets STOP
START a trap for UNK these UNK UNK UNK to the barrel so that the UNK can throw his own targets STOP
START a spring trap for solid UNK and a regular hand trap are also available STOP
START you can have your choice of a UNK UNK , the UNK ( about UNK ) or a UNK , the UNK ( UNK less ) STOP
START the UNK is a good UNK for fun shooting or for economic UNK practice , but it's UNK than it looks to run up a score on the clay birds STOP
START UNK travel 50 feet or more when thrown from the spring trap but it's almost impossible to break one after it passes the UNK mark STOP
START the combination of thin pattern and very tiny UNK makes it necessary to get on the birds , right now ! ! STOP
START big UNK UNK appeared in the UNK line for 1961 , with the addition of the and to the list of model UNK STOP
START these are made on special order only , in UNK grade ( about UNK ) , with integral UNK UNK and heavy UNK UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START they UNK around nine pounds STOP
START a UNK version of the highly regarded UNK UNK UNK also appeared in 1961 STOP
START this UNK ( under UNK , about UNK more for a UNK grade ) has an UNK barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year's model UNK UNK with a UNK STOP
START this design is hard to beat for timber hunting or for packing in a UNK UNK STOP
START presently , the UNK is available in af STOP
START the latest UNK of the famous UNK model UNK are the UNK UNK ( about UNK ) and the UNK UNK ( under UNK ) , which have a UNK safety and improved UNK design STOP
START the replacement of the UNK side safety catch will make this UNK favorite more UNK than ever since the new safety is easier and UNK to operate STOP
START UNK guns , UNK STOP
START a fresh crop of UNK guns showed up in 1961 , and they're good UNK for your christmas gift list if you're UNK what to get for a UNK STOP
START the most unusual of them is the UNK UNK ( about UNK , UNK for a UNK UNK ) -- a UNK UNK UNK after the famous UNK UNK and UNK the western look STOP
START because of its traditional lines , it probably has more UNK appeal than any other model STOP
START the action is a UNK , handling all the standard STOP
START UNK STOP
START UNK latest is also designed for the beginning UNK , although it's a UNK rifle with plenty of barrel weight and ample stock STOP
START this is the model UNK ( about UNK ) ; ; STOP
START it's a UNK UNK with an automatic safety -- i.e, the safety goes on every time the UNK is UNK and the gun UNK for the next shot STOP
START stock design is excellent , and this model is a good first gun STOP
START another UNK model is the STOP
START UNK UNK UNK ( around UNK ) , which comes with a UNK barrel and a short -- UNK -- stock ; ; STOP
START it's just right for a boy of UNK STOP
START a UNK UNK has also been introduced this year STOP
START the UNK UNK UNK ( under UNK ) is made with a side lever rather than a UNK lever because many UNK aren't strong enough to operate a top UNK to open a gun -- and the side lever does indeed open very easily STOP
START this gun has a UNK stock and is available in either 20 or UNK STOP
START there's another addition to the UNK line , the UNK model UNK in ( under UNK ) , which you may or may not consider a UNK gun ; ; STOP
START many experienced UNK like this UNK and type of UNK too STOP
START UNK , UNK STOP
START although there were no startling developments in UNK design this year , a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit the market STOP
START for example , a UNK trap version of the UNK over , the UNK ( from UNK up , depending on grade ) , UNK from standard models in that it is equipped with a full UNK UNK end , a UNK UNK UNK and a UNK UNK UNK for fast UNK STOP
START the colt line now includes a new UNK , the standard or custom UNK model ( about UNK and UNK , respectively ) in 12 , 16 and 20 STOP
START UNK international has introduced another UNK , this one from UNK STOP
START it's the UNK ( about UNK ) , a UNK over very much like the old UNK UNK -- which was so fine a gun that today a used one still brings high prices STOP
START high standard has also added two models to its line STOP
START the UNK UNK ( prices begin at less than UNK and depend on grade and UNK features ) is a UNK auto STOP
START the UNK UNK ( beginning at just over UNK ) is a UNK gun in 12 or 16 STOP
START either model is a very good dollar value STOP
START UNK latest contribution to the field is the model UNK ( from UNK ) ; ; STOP

START breakfast was at the palace hotel , UNK was UNK in the mountain forest , and dinner was either at UNK UNK or at santa UNK STOP
START UNK too long at the UNK could be UNK , so UNK were UNK between meals STOP

START the frames are UNK only for the UNK and the UNK STOP
START if UNK for the battens , they would require more work , be UNK and UNK holes would have to be UNK so that UNK water could flow through STOP
START nowhere in the boat do the frames come in contact with the UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK is erected after the frames and transom are complete STOP
START this is an important step because any UNK would cause UNK worse UNK in the UNK as you advance in construction STOP
START be sure all members are parallel , vertical and level as required STOP
START after the frames and transom are set up on the UNK and temporarily UNK , a piece of UNK UNK ( only UNK will be given since the 13 thickness is used throughout ) is UNK between frames one and two below the line of the UNK STOP
START the frames are glued and screwed to this piece STOP

START placement is important because the rear seat , bunks and front UNK UNK rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens STOP
START with the exception of two battens , all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed after careful UNK STOP
START the UNK go in the same way except that they are made of two pieces of UNK wood for strength and easier UNK STOP
START UNK is always a UNK job but the work can be cut down considerably with a skill UNK and a simple UNK STOP

START UNK the sides first , using UNK and UNK , UNK UNK UNK at all battens , the stem and the transom STOP
START another person inside with a weight against each UNK will help in the UNK STOP
START the best procedure is to have a few friends hold the UNK in place while you mark it off STOP
START then trim the excess STOP
START i used a UNK UNK made by porter UNK for this job STOP
START it's good for cutting all the UNK because it cuts with a UNK UNK at high UNK and does not UNK the UNK like a UNK saw STOP
START when cut , the UNK is UNK in place for a final and careful UNK STOP
START then it is marked on the inside where it comes in contact with the transom , frames , UNK and all the battens STOP
START it may then be UNK for the UNK STOP
START the next step is to remove it and spread UNK where it has been marked at the contact points STOP
START then it is replaced and fastened STOP
START the bottom UNK is applied in the same manner STOP
START after UNK , the bottom gets a layer of UNK STOP
START the spray UNK are first glued on the outside and fastened from the inside with UNK STOP
START then the UNK are UNK off and the bottom is UNK in preparation STOP
START since the sides are also covered up to the spray UNK , they are also UNK in that area STOP
START the cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at a time STOP
START a UNK width is used on each side and it UNK the UNK line by about three inches STOP
START lay the cloth in place and trim it to size STOP
START then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of UNK STOP
START when the UNK has UNK , UNK up another UNK with a UNK added if you wish STOP
START i used bright red , UNK the UNK in thoroughly before adding the UNK STOP
START using a UNK brush , coat one side of the bottom with the UNK and then apply the cloth STOP
START when the cloth is smooth , apply another coat of UNK , UNK it with a paint UNK STOP
START be sure it is well UNK and then allow it to UNK STOP
START when the whole bottom has UNK , use a disk UNK to UNK the edges of the cloth at the UNK line and near the spray UNK STOP
START then lay a UNK strip of cloth along the UNK line from the transom to the point of the stem STOP
START before the UNK has UNK , screw a UNK UNK UNK strip along the UNK STOP
START this UNK the bottom in UNK STOP
START UNK materials are available from glass plastic supply UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK , UNK STOP
START they will also supply literature on application STOP
START the UNK is now turned over ( with the help of about seven friends ) and placed in a level , UNK position STOP
START i set it on the UNK UNK STOP
START i laid three UNK of glass cloth on the inside of the stem , also UNK a UNK eye at this time STOP
START for added strength , i also fastened a small block on each side of every frame and UNK joint STOP
START again , these blocks were set in UNK glass cloth and UNK STOP
START after UNK off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to UNK them to the UNK at a working height , the top of the side UNK is installed STOP
START this is made up of UNK left over from the sides and bottom STOP
START these UNK parts really help to keep the boat dry STOP
START when they're on , the top edges are UNK even with the UNK UNK STOP
START the sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from frame six to the transom , forming a real strong transom UNK STOP
START note another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between these pieces STOP
START the UNK is UNK UNK marine UNK STOP
START all the UNK and the storage UNK is UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP
START most floor battens are glued and screwed to the UNK STOP
START the exception is where the UNK UNK STOP
START these battens are glued and screwed to the frames STOP
START with all UNK battens in place , the UNK is UNK and painted up to the floor line STOP
START use one coat of UNK and one coat of marine paint STOP
START UNK of the UNK are also painted and the UNK is then screwed in place STOP
START after the UNK is on , the UNK sides are installed STOP
START they're followed by the front and rear UNK as illustrated STOP
START the UNK glass is UNK and UNK is used in the UNK STOP
START inside , bunks are UNK up and installed as indicated STOP
START a head is a UNK thing to have and i installed one under a UNK section of the port UNK STOP
START the UNK in the UNK panel above the UNK UNK into the head and a UNK water UNK is mounted on the UNK above the UNK STOP
START for UNK the UNK and bunks , i used UNK , type aj STOP
START UNK , UNK , fire UNK and UNK stable , it is easily UNK to the wood with contact UNK STOP
START available in af sheets , it costs about a dollar a square foot STOP
START you can build this vacation UNK yourself STOP
START it is a full scale , small , but efficient house that can become a year UNK UNK complete in every detail STOP
START because of the unique design by the architect UNK UNK , you can build most of it in your own home workshop in your spare time STOP
START most of it is UNK and UNK standard materials , and requires the use of only simple tools STOP
START on the following pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to your vacation UNK , from UNK the proper site to applying the final trim STOP
START in recognition of the growing trend for second homes , or vacation UNK , we have designed this one specifically with the family UNK in mind STOP
START it is a big project , not to be taken lightly STOP
START but each step has been broken down into easy stages , UNK standard materials and simple tools , well within the capabilities of the UNK STOP
START the theory STOP
START the idea behind our design is UNK units , or UNK STOP
START everything possible has been UNK to standard UNK and measurements of materials STOP
START wall panels and structural UNK are standard as are windows and UNK , making for a minimum of cutting STOP
START we have developed an UNK method of UNK these so that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop , panel by panel , according to plan STOP
START thus , when you have prepared your foundation and laid the floor , these can be UNK to the site and erected with a small crew of friends in a UNK STOP
START the roof UNK are UNK and the panels standard so that the house can be completely UNK in a matter of three or four days STOP
START then you can do the UNK UNK at your UNK STOP
START a warning STOP
START due to the fact that building codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country , the first thing to do is to find out what , if any , they are STOP
START close to a large city they might even specify the size of the UNK used ; ; STOP
START in a remote section there might be no restrictions at all STOP
START this can usually be found out at the nearest town hall STOP
START at the same time check the electrical , UNK , and UNK requirements , as well as possible UNK regulations STOP
START whether electricity and public water and UNK are available or not , check the local customs in the use of UNK or UNK gas ( we give you alternatives later on ) STOP
START be sure that this information is reasonably official and not just an UNK opinion STOP
START if there are any major restrictions , they usually can be obtained in printed form STOP
START where a building permit is required , find out what you must present when applying for one STOP
START in many cases , you must file a complete set of plans with the local building UNK STOP
START these will be available at cost from our plans department STOP
START the site STOP
START some general things to look for in a site , if you UNK already bought one , are UNK , water UNK , and orientation STOP
START how are the roads , and how will they stand up ? ? STOP
START is there evidence of UNK on the property ; ; STOP
START UNK areas or UNK springs ? ? STOP
START a visit in the early spring after a UNK will be very UNK STOP
START note where the sun rises and sets , and ask which direction the prevailing UNK and UNK come from STOP
START will the view be something you can live with ? ? STOP
START don't worry too much about UNK or UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START we will take up alternative foundations later on STOP
START the materials STOP
START with this first issue we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic ( UNK version ) and the UNK ( UNK version ) STOP
START this will be for the UNK of the house only ( roof , walls , and floor ) , and does not include the UNK or UNK STOP
START this will permit you to get a rough estimate of how much the materials for the UNK will cost STOP
START bear in mind that this does not include interior panels for UNK , UNK UNK , UNK and UNK , electrical UNK , and UNK , all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues STOP
START the wall panels are constructed of a UNK of standard af and af of a good grade , free from structural UNK STOP
START they should be as straight as possible , as this will effect their ability to UNK properly when the walls are erected STOP
START the outside surface of the solid units shall be of an UNK grade of panel board such as UNK , plastic UNK panel board , high density particle board , UNK board , or any other product UNK obtainable upon recommendation of your building supply dealer STOP
START the inner panels do not have to be UNK , and the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired STOP
START all panel board comes in standard af foot size STOP
START it is recommended that panels be both glued as well as UNK to the frame STOP
START the fixed window panels with UNK should have a good grade of 1 UNK glass set in a UNK UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK are constructed as shown in the detail , with a drop door for UNK STOP
START there are standard UNK glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels requiring them STOP
START the door panels are designed to UNK standard UNK which should be of UNK grade STOP
START the UNK panels for the UNK ends are cut from full af sheets as shown , leaving no UNK STOP
START the battens covering the UNK are of af stock and are applied after the walls are erected STOP
START all UNK should be UNK , and aluminum is highly recommended STOP
START note : if 1 panel board is used inside and out , or 5 one side and 3 the other , and 1 glass is used , stock lumber in af , af , and af can be used in making the glass panels STOP
START other UNK may UNK UNK a special size lumber for the glass trim STOP
START in any case , there is no special milling or UNK required for the panels STOP
START with modern techniques of UNK and the UNK of cutting tools , UNK , and UNK available , the drill press has become a basic home workshop tool STOP
START the drill press consists of a vertical UNK ( UNK ) which is UNK or UNK on one end to hold a drill UNK , a UNK housing ( UNK ) in which the UNK is mounted , a head in which the UNK is mounted , a feed lever which moves the UNK up or down , a power source , and a movable table upon which the work is placed STOP
START there is often a means of locking the UNK and , on larger UNK , the table can be UNK STOP
START the size of the press is usually expressed in terms of UNK capacity ( the maximum diameter tool UNK it will hold ) or distance between the UNK center and the column STOP
START a press with an 11 inch capacity UNK you drill to the center of a 22 inch board or circle STOP
START a new UNK drill press with a 16 inch capacity has a UNK head that allows UNK to be done at any angle STOP
START the head is mounted on a UNK arm that UNK on the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work STOP
START UNK and maintenance STOP
START the drill press should be UNK and , depending on whether it is a bench or floor model , UNK UNK to a UNK bench or stand or screwed to the floor with UNK or expansion UNK STOP
START this will reduce UNK and increase accuracy STOP
START a coat of UNK UNK or a UNK with a piece of UNK paper will protect the UNK surface of the table ; ; STOP
START UNK with a slightly UNK cloth will UNK UNK of the column and UNK STOP
START UNK not UNK with sealed UNK UNK will need a drop of oil now and then in the UNK holes in the UNK STOP
START the rest of the press should be kept clean by UNK with a clean UNK or brush STOP
START be careful to keep the drive belt free of oil and UNK STOP
START belt tension is adjusted by UNK of two locking UNK and a movable motor mount STOP
START keep the belt just UNK enough so the UNK won't slip when pulled by hand ; ; STOP
START excess tension will only cause UNK wear on the motor and UNK UNK STOP
START most drill UNK have a UNK return spring that raises the UNK automatically when the feed lever is released and holds the UNK in the raised position STOP
START the return spring tension may be adjusted to suit individual requirements by UNK the spring housing with a pair of UNK ( to prevent the spring from UNK when it is released ) , UNK the UNK UNK or screw , and rotating the housing until the desired tension is achieved STOP
START turning the housing UNK will reduce tension , UNK will increase it STOP
START don't lose the UNK key STOP
START STOP
START some manufacturers have had the UNK to provide a UNK for the UNK key ; ; STOP
START otherwise , you'll have to spend a few minutes to either UNK a suitable spring UNK UNK on the press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and UNK to the bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not in use STOP
START UNK and speeds STOP
START drill speeds are important if you want a good job STOP
START each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed , depending on the material worked STOP
START on most drill UNK , it is impossible to get the exact speed , but you can come close by UNK the drive belt on the UNK UNK STOP
START you will find a chart giving the various speed ratios available with your particular drill press UNK in the instruction UNK that came with the tool STOP
START see the table on page 34 for exact recommended speeds STOP
START generally , the larger the tool and the harder the material , the UNK the speed STOP
START feed pressure is also of major importance STOP
START too much pressure will force the tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and UNK or broken tools STOP
START too light a feed , particularly with metal or other hard material , causes UNK of the tool and burning of the cutting edge STOP
START the best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure that UNK the tool cut easily at an even rate STOP
START common UNK tools STOP
START there are numerous types and styles of tools to drill holes STOP
START the most common are the twist drill , the solid center UNK with UNK cutting UNK , the double UNK bit , and the power wood bit STOP
START all will do a good job if sharp , but the twist UNK don't cut quite as UNK as the others , since they do not have the UNK UNK that UNK the fibers before actual UNK starts STOP
START the UNK fly UNK is very useful for cutting large diameter holes and can be used to cut UNK UNK by UNK the UNK UNK STOP
START since fly UNK are one UNK and not balanced , they should be used at the UNK speed available , and fed very slowly to avoid binding STOP
START fly UNK can UNK you into putting your hand too close to the tool , so if you want to avoid UNK fingers , keep your hands well out of the way STOP
START simple hole UNK operations STOP
START when UNK all the way through a UNK , always place a piece of UNK wood UNK STOP
START this will not only protect the work table , but also assure a clean UNK STOP
START another method of UNK a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through , then drill half way with the dimensional bit , turn the piece over , and finish from the other side STOP
START in soft woods with UNK grain , there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to UNK , due to the varying UNK of the wood STOP
START in this case , UNK a small pilot hole or UNK the work will do much to improve accuracy STOP
START when a hole is to be UNK to a UNK depth , mark the depth on the side of the stock , then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark STOP
START the depth UNK UNK can now be set , and any number of holes UNK to exact and identical depth STOP
START the UNK bridges over the UNK river in massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects STOP
START for their length , their types of construction , their UNK UNK , and their literary associations , they should be known and remembered STOP
START in this sequence i shall write about them in the order of their UNK STOP
START the first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part , -- and perhaps the most interesting one , connected UNK ( now UNK ) with UNK point STOP
START its building was first proposed in UNK , when a group of citizens , mostly UNK men , UNK the general court for an act of UNK STOP
START this UNK began : `` UNK UNK port , may UNK , UNK STOP
START `` whereas , a bridge over UNK river , from the land of UNK UNK UNK , UNK , in UNK , to UNK island , and from said island to UNK , would be of very extensive utility , by UNK a safe UNK to UNK , teams and UNK at all UNK of the year , and at all times of UNK STOP
START `` we , the UNK , do agree , that as soon as a convenient number of persons have UNK to this , or a similar writing , we will present a UNK to the UNK general court of the UNK of massachusetts , UNK for an act UNK into a body UNK the UNK to such writing with liberty to build such a bridge , and a right to demand a UNK equal to that received at UNK bridge , and on like terms , and if such an act shall be obtained , then we UNK agree each with the others , that we will hold in the said bridge the several shares set against our respective names , the whole into two hundred shares being divided , and that we will pay such sums of money at such times and in such UNK , as by the said proposed corporation , shall be directed and required '' STOP
START this paper was signed by UNK persons , UNK a total of two hundred shares STOP
START a month later the general court served notice to the town of UNK that the bridge was to be built STOP
START the matter was considered and UNK , and finally opposed , but in spite of many UNK , the court granted a UNK on january 9 , UNK STOP
START on november 26 of that year the bridge was completed and opened STOP
START UNK UNK , who UNK and later UNK the UNK type of construction for wooden bridges , was the genius who planned and UNK the building of the UNK , or `` UNK island '' bridge although the actual work was carried out under the direction of william UNK , who received UNK as UNK STOP
START this UNK bridge is best described by UNK UNK , president of yale college , in his `` UNK in UNK and UNK '' , published in new UNK in UNK STOP
START he says of it : STOP
START `` it consists of two divisions , separated by an island at a small distance from the southern shore STOP
START the division between the island and this shore , consists UNK of an UNK ; ; STOP
START whose UNK is one hundred and UNK feet , and whose UNK is forty feet ( it was actually UNK feet ) above the UNK mark STOP
START in appearance and construction it UNK the UNK bridge STOP
START the whole length of UNK bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its UNK UNK STOP
START i have already mentioned that UNK UNK of UNK was the UNK of the UNK bridges in this country STOP
START as UNK was educated to UNK only , and had never seen a structure of this nature ; ; STOP
START he certainly UNK not a little credit for the invention '' STOP
START it is hardly necessary to UNK students of covered bridges that UNK UNK was born in UNK in nearby UNK ; ; STOP
START that he moved with his parents to west UNK when he was sixteen years old ; ; STOP
START and was there UNK to a builder and architect , UNK UNK STOP
START it was indeed a remarkable UNK that a man who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the principle of the UNK , which appears in his famous bridges at UNK , UNK , and philadelphia STOP
START the UNK UNK bridge when first built was not covered STOP
START as far as we know , no american bridge had been thus protected in UNK STOP
START richard UNK is the authority for the statement that the northern section was probably UNK by UNK STOP
START its original appearance is shown in an UNK published in the `` massachusetts magazine '' in may UNK , which is UNK UNK ( fig1 ) STOP
START a brief description accompanying the picture says that the bridge contained more than UNK tons of timber STOP
START between the UNK on the UNK shore and the south bank of UNK island there was one span or UNK measuring UNK feet ; ; STOP
START between the north shore of UNK island and the UNK side there was an UNK of UNK feet and a series of UNK with a draw forty feet long STOP
START a dinner and UNK in honor of this piece of engineering took place july 4 , UNK , in a UNK erected by the corporation on the island STOP
START it is said that the UNK UNK UNK , who was one of the first UNK , stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the occasion STOP
START the `` UNK journal '' says that he `` delivered an UNK on the bridge , which for UNK of style , UNK of speech or force of argument , was truly UNK '' STOP
START the UNK must have written this with tongue in UNK , because UNK UNK could hardly be understood ; ; STOP
START and , although he later explained that he was talking french , it seems rather more likely that he had UNK to the UNK of the evening STOP
START the north portion of the UNK bridge was well worth the cost of construction , although it proved to be twice what was estimated in the beginning STOP
START it stood in its original form until UNK STOP
START the southern half , however , on account of its UNK , was considered by boat owners a UNK to UNK STOP
START in UNK it was UNK down and replaced by a chain UNK bridge STOP
START this was built by john UNK from plans submitted by james UNK of UNK county , pennsylvania STOP
START UNK UNK had general supervision of the work STOP
START an UNK in the `` UNK UNK '' , december 21 , UNK , shows UNK in a new light as an expert on chain bridges STOP
START it UNK : `` chain bridges STOP
START `` STOP
START information is UNK given that UNK UNK of UNK , UNK agreed to take charge of the concerns of the UNK of the chain bridge , in the states of massachusetts , new UNK , vermont , rhode island , and connecticut , so far as UNK to the sale of patent rights and the construction of chain bridges STOP
START `` UNK will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if desired will view the proposed site , and lay out and UNK the work , or recommend a suitable person to UNK it STOP
START john UNK STOP
START `` approved , UNK UNK '' STOP
START STOP
START this chain bridge proved less UNK than the wooden UNK on the UNK end STOP
START it fell , february 6 , UNK , carrying with it a horse and wagon , two men and four UNK STOP
START the horse and men were saved , but the UNK UNK STOP
START in spite of this UNK , the bridge was UNK on the same plan and opened again on july 17 , UNK STOP
START this second chain bridge was UNK feet long , had two UNK UNK and a draw , and a double UNK STOP
START the UNK bridge was a UNK UNK until UNK , when the county UNK laid out all the UNK bridges as UNK STOP
START UNK and strong after more than a century of continuous use , the old covered , wooden bridge that UNK the UNK valley river at UNK will have a distinctive part in the UNK UNK of the first land battle of the civil war at its home site , may UNK to june UNK STOP
START colonel UNK UNK , UNK , will again make his UNK ride down the UNK UNK of UNK ( now college ) hill and UNK across the bridge to join colonel UNK UNK ( west ) virginia infantry , then UNK through the streets in UNK of the UNK UNK STOP
START he was closely followed by the ohio and indiana troops -- thus the old bridge has another distinction ; ; STOP
START that of being the first such structure UNK by force of arms in the war of the UNK STOP
START the bridge has UNK the natural UNK of the elements , war , fire , and UNK , as well as UNK incident to heavy traffic , for more than a hundred years STOP
START twice during the civil war it was saved from destruction by the opposing armies by the UNK and prayers of a local minister STOP
START it still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the last century and still serves in the UNK age to carry heavy traffic on UNK UNK -- the old UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START it is one of the very few , if not the only UNK bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the UNK system , thus it is far more than a UNK of the horse and UNK days STOP
START this covered , wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action in the early morning of june 3 , UNK , and with subsequent troop movements of both armies in the UNK area that it has become a part and UNK of the war story STOP
START so frequently have pictures of the bridge appeared in books and in national publications that it UNK with the old john brown fort at UNK UNK as the two UNK best known structures in west virginia STOP
START completed and opened for traffic in UNK , the bridge was designed and built by UNK UNK and his brother , UNK , of UNK STOP
START the UNK brothers were experienced bridge builders , and against the competition of other , and better known , bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of the covered , wooden bridges on the UNK and UNK UNK a dozen years before , as well as many other bridges for several counties STOP
START the UNK bridge , however , was the UNK master piece , with its UNK , UNK lane , span -- and it stands today as a monument to its builders STOP
START never UNK , the bridge was UNK in UNK by two extra UNK , a concrete floor , and a UNK along the upper side in order to care for modern traffic STOP
START during the war it was in constant use by the wagon UNK UNK supplies from the UNK at UNK to the troops operating in the interior STOP
START union soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the rain or other UNK weather , and some of them left UNK of their stay by UNK their names and small UNK on its walls and beams STOP
START but what the elements could not do was seriously threatened when UNK general william UNK UNK ) jones reached UNK while on the famous UNK UNK in may , UNK STOP
START general jones was fresh from a long series of bridge UNK , including the long bridge at UNK , and , after seeing a great drove of horses and cattle he had collected UNK across the bridge , he sent his men to work UNK UNK in and around it STOP
START UNK UNK UNK , a baptist minister , gathered a few citizens of southern UNK , to call on jones and UNK with him to spare the structure ; ; STOP
START he UNK and argued , pointing out that jones or other confederate UNK would need it should troops pass that way in UNK STOP
START jones UNK , he did not order his men to apply the UNK -- the drove of livestock was driven up the valley , via UNK , and across the mountains to feed and serve the confederate army , while jones and his UNK turned toward UNK to join forces with UNK STOP
START again UNK UNK saved the bridge when union soldiers planned to destroy it , after filling its two UNK with hay and UNK -- but for what reason is not recorded nor remembered , certainly not because of pressure from an opposing confederate force STOP
START on the second occasion it took prayers as well as reason to UNK the soldiers from their purpose STOP
START UNK around this historic old structure , a group of UNK UNK county citizens have organized and planned a UNK series of events , beginning on may UNK and continuing through june UNK , to observe most UNK the UNK of the first land UNK of the civil war at UNK STOP
START it is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming pool -- eight UNK , vigorous , UNK , not wholly UNK years STOP
START we have learned a lot -- a UNK of UNK here , a bit about UNK and UNK there STOP
START we have had sound UNK in the principles of the UNK school of UNK STOP
START we have become amateur insurance experts and UNK yard birds STOP
START true , our problems have UNK a bit as more and more of our neighbors have built their own UNK , thereby UNK our spectacular UNK STOP
START but problems UNK to UNK , as any pool owner knows STOP
START so our UNK UNK of spirit UNK us to share our trials , errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool UNK for the first time -- in the UNK hope that some may profit from our experience STOP
START where to put it STOP
START position may not be everything , but in the case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties , social and physical STOP
START we speak from varying UNK STOP
START one of us has a pool set in a UNK area very near the house STOP
START the other has his pool far away from the house in a field high on a hill STOP
START if you are UNK of a blue , UNK pool right outside your living room windows , close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of children , UNK UNK , UNK tubes of UNK oil and UNK plastic UNK STOP
START you are likely to be UNK the truth STOP
START you can also see that the greater the UNK of the pool to your main living quarters , the greater the chance for violation of family UNK , UNK noise and the UNK attitude STOP
START on the other hand , UNK does not lead to UNK when children cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long UNK to reach the pool STOP
START another dilemma : as UNK as a UNK pond in the forest may be , trees offer a UNK and root UNK to the UNK of a pool STOP
START yet a UNK approach can turn a pool into a UNK UNK every time the grass is UNK STOP
START as in UNK a wife , it is only UNK to consider also how UNK a pool is likely to be in bad weather as well as in good STOP
START in the UNK UNK , for instance , you will have to live through the many UNK winter months when your pool will hardly look its best STOP
START it may be a big hole in the ground filled with salt hay , or an ice UNK UNK with UNK STOP
START even a UNK , UNK UNK is not exactly a joy to UNK STOP
START ( we do , however , recommend those UNK covers to prevent both people and UNK -- UNK and UNK generally -- from UNK UNK in the pool STOP
START ) STOP
START probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts STOP
START naturally it will be UNK to a large extent by the shape and size of your land STOP
START but if space and money are no problem and small children are not on hand every day , it is certainly more UNK to have your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate UNK of the house STOP
START and a good several feet around the pool should be neither UNK nor woods , but good hard UNK STOP
START the placement of your pool , however , will not of itself solve the two major problems of pool UNK -- those that involve your social life and those UNK to safety STOP
START UNK with them demands UNK discipline -- of yourself as well as of your family , neighbors , friends and anyone you ever talked to on a UNK jet STOP
START eight years ago while we were going through the UNK construction period , we were each UNK by the vision of early morning UNK and evening UNK to a cool family collected around the pool with a UNK table laid out nearby for the lord and UNK UNK STOP
START but not even our first UNK UNK came anywhere near those UNK UNK STOP
START we seemed to be UNK the population UNK right in our own UNK STOP
START our respective families looked as if they had UNK STOP
START had we taken a UNK on a state park ? ? STOP
START not at all STOP
START we had merely been discovered by the pool UNK STOP
START we were in business ! ! STOP
START from proud UNK to UNK UNK and UNK was a short step -- no more than the change from city clothes to UNK STOP
START naive of us , maybe , but the results of our UNK UNK to `` come over next summer and UNK in our new pool '' were both unexpected and UNK STOP
START our book of UNK STOP
START after the first few weeks , it was obvious that rules had to be made , laid down and UNK -- even if our popularity UNK became UNK as a result STOP
START so rules we made , in UNK UNK STOP
START since our UNK in this respect UNK precisely , we present the fruits of our efforts UNK as a single social code for pool owners STOP
START first and UNK : no one -- no , not anyone -- in the family is allowed to issue UNK UNK to his or her own circle STOP
START just short of forty UNK we finally managed to UNK our children to this view STOP
START their friends and ours are welcome to share the pool , but on our terms and at our times STOP
START no friends are to arrive without an UNK or without at least UNK UNK STOP
START no UNK , either -- even if they are UNK legitimate UNK STOP
START we want to know when the UNK telephone exactly how many they are planning to bring , so that we won't end up with a UNK UNK that looks like UNK island in august STOP

START a UNK of UNK mothers , UNK to the pool , is no UNK STOP
START no bottle pool is UNK -- bottle pool being our UNK for those who come to UNK and UNK into our bar while UNK that they can only UNK and run STOP
START ( UNK , UNK and relations with our wine merchant took a UNK that first summer as we UNK became the neighborhood UNK stop STOP
START ) STOP
START we designated one day a week as the time when neighborhood UNK might UNK at definite hours STOP
START this has saved us from constant UNK seven days a week and made us feel less UNK to the young `` less fortunate '' than ours STOP
START we also worked out UNK for sunday afternoon UNK who arrive two hours early with their UNK guests while we are still UNK an UNK lunch UNK UNK STOP
START we gently UNK them to an island of tables and UNK UNK placed on the far side of the pool where they can UNK each other until we get ready to UNK sides STOP
START all UNK ( UNK to be more exact ) must be done in our small UNK house or at the UNK homes STOP
START ( to avoid any possible UNK for a UNK parade through your house , it is a good idea to have a telephone extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between the pool , and the parking area STOP
START ) we do , however , provide a limited number of extra suits , mainly for children , and we stock extra UNK and a few UNK UNK UNK STOP
START UNK , the UNK UNK kind , are held in readiness , too , for the very young STOP
START UNK life and UNK STOP
START safety rules , of course , are more important than all the others put together STOP
START in many UNK , now , the law requires all UNK to be UNK , usually to a minimum height of 5 feet STOP
START but UNK or UNK , no UNK is the place for running or UNK STOP
START we allow no UNK endurance UNK , either , or UNK UNK of water UNK STOP
START UNK boards must have UNK surfaces ( UNK UNK takes an UNK UNK from chlorine and UNK quickly , but UNK UNK are excellent ) STOP
START and UNK must be UNK to look before they UNK , either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge STOP
START our UNK also have wide , UNK steps -- for the benefit of the UNK UNK who can thus be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a UNK UNK STOP
START all UNK must be kept a safe distance away from the pool and drinking glasses are UNK in favor of plastic or metal UNK STOP
START when you first acquire a pool , we UNK recommend -- for your own mental health -- a good long UNK with your insurance agent STOP
START you should be prepared to cope with any UNK such as UNK into empty UNK or UNK ends and all manner of winter as well as summer UNK STOP
START UNK UNK , UNK , do not just happen STOP
START they are the result of a constant and careful contest with the elements STOP
START unless you want to make your wife a pool UNK and to spend a great many of your UNK hours UNK your UNK UNK UNK , its care and feeding -- from UNK content to UNK and UNK -- is best left to a weekly or UNK professional service STOP
START of course , if your pool is close to the house , your wife can always add it to her UNK UNK ( you hope ) STOP
START or you can make pool care the price of swimming for UNK STOP
START even so , every pool owner , in case of emergency , should have some idea of what makes things work STOP

START you can hope against hope that come spring cleaning , your UNK friends will UNK a hand at UNK and UNK STOP
START it has happened STOP
START many hours of spring cleaning will be saved , however , if you remove the main drain UNK when you close the pool season in the fall STOP
START as the pool is UNK , stand by to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet STOP
START much of the dirt and UNK UNK is easily removed when UNK , but requires UNK if allowed to dry STOP
START if you have a UNK to UNK drain UNK , you may easily wash out all the UNK when the UNK is out STOP
START of course , when your UNK UNK of water is released , it may cause a lot of comment as it passes through or by neighboring properties STOP
START do not forget this possibility STOP
START if your pool is located on or near UNK ground , it may have natural UNK which is certainly more desirable than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first UNK out the water and then UNK out all the UNK STOP
START it may be true that pool lighting UNK an evening scene , but lights also UNK all the insect life for miles around STOP
START once on the water , these little visitors seldom leave , and this UNK to your UNK and UNK problems as well as providing a UNK good time for all those present STOP
START often one UNK high in a tree will provide all the light you need at much less expense STOP
START our experience has taught us that it UNK to buy the best equipment possible , from UNK to UNK STOP
START follow UNK instructions to the letter , and be sure that one person ( in the family or not ) is regularly responsible for each aspect of the job , with no chance for UNK , `` it wasn't my turn '' STOP
START never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the UNK -- even if the little boys do want to play space ship STOP
START you may find yourself UNK bottom , literally , as you discover that water is running out even while you are putting it in STOP
START draw a line across the country at the UNK of lower pennsylvania STOP
START any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be UNK in 10 years STOP
START fortunately , it is the UNK which has arrived at this conclusion , for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage , and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress STOP
START even if you live above that line , the UNK will back you , for they have decided that the UNK of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged STOP
START new UNK UNK units , recently devised UNK UNK UNK , and improved UNK techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an UNK house for as little as UNK to UNK STOP
START two men can often do the installation in a day STOP
START you can UNK it yourself -- this is a central system that will cool every part of your house STOP
START its UNK ? ? STOP
START no less an authority than the UNK UNK that the savings air conditioning makes possible more than UNK its operating costs STOP
START is it UNK ? ? STOP
START home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of UNK UNK and the thermal shock they UNK STOP
START we know now that a UNK differential in temperature is the maximum usually desirable , and accurate controls assure the comfort we want STOP
START we know , too , that health is never UNK by summer cooling STOP
START on the contrary , there are fewer UNK and smaller doctor bills STOP
START the UNK air benefits UNK , UNK , UNK , hay fever STOP
START control of temperature and UNK is a UNK to the UNK and the UNK STOP
START heart conditions and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by UNK heat STOP
START UNK is easier STOP
START the UNK air means less time spent UNK a vacuum , fewer trips to the dry UNK , UNK UNK for the washing machine STOP
START the need for UNK , UNK , UNK becomes more UNK STOP
START clothes hold their shape better , and UNK and UNK become almost forgotten words STOP
START it will improve your UNK STOP
START when you're less UNK , things just naturally look UNK STOP
START the children can have their daytime UNK and hot meals , and be put to bed on schedule in UNK rooms STOP
START you'll sleep longer and better , too , UNK UNK and free of hot weather UNK STOP
START you can forget about UNK , and leave the UNK windows up all year around STOP
START best of all , central air conditioning is something you can afford STOP
START like its UNK UNK , the UNK , a UNK can be expected to last 20 to 25 years or more STOP
START that brings its UNK cost down mighty low STOP
START for any house STOP
START no matter what style your home is , ranch , UNK , colonial or contemporary , central air conditioning is easily installed STOP
START the equipment won't take up valuable space either STOP
START it can go in UNK waste space STOP
START but there's no UNK that the UNK and most economical way to get UNK UNK air conditioning is when you build STOP
START if that's done , the house can be designed and UNK for best operation , and this can mean savings both in the size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself STOP
START if you can't see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building , by all means make provision for its easy adding later STOP
START manufacturers have designed equipment for just such circumstances , and your savings over starting from UNK will be substantial STOP
START if your house is to have a forced warm air system , cooling can be a part of it STOP
START this costs less than having a completely separate cooling system , for your regular heating UNK , UNK and UNK UNK do double duty for cooling STOP
START you can get UNK air UNK in the same variety of styles in which you buy a UNK alone -- high or low boy , UNK or UNK STOP
START the units can be installed in basement , UNK , UNK , or in a UNK located in the living area STOP
START the cooling UNK is located in the UNK UNK STOP
START from the UNK small UNK UNK UNK to a UNK refrigeration section set in the yard , UNK , UNK , or basement STOP
START if you plan to add cooling later to your heating system , there are things to watch for STOP
START be sure UNK that require UNK get it when they are installed STOP
START they may be UNK later STOP
START be sure your UNK and UNK are big enough to handle cooling STOP
START this is especially important if you live in a UNK UNK STOP
START be sure you get a UNK heating system , and UNK that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating STOP
START you can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house STOP
START for cooling , UNK water is UNK instead of hot water STOP
START instead of UNK you'll have UNK units , each with its own UNK STOP
START these systems are more expensive than UNK forced air systems STOP
START the minimum cost for an average UNK , UNK house with basement , is likely to run UNK above the cost of the heating alone STOP
START separate systems STOP
START if the problems of UNK cooling with your heating are UNK , it may be UNK to plan on a completely separate cooling system STOP
START the UNK kind of separate system uses a single , UNK unit STOP
START it is , in effect , an UNK room UNK equipped with UNK UNK UNK to UNK the cooled , UNK , UNK air where it is wanted STOP
START in a long , UNK ranch , two such units can be installed , one serving the living area , the other the sleeping UNK STOP
START in a UNK house , one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first floor , another in the UNK to cool the second STOP
START in each case , having separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of UNK individual UNK control STOP
START the heat UNK STOP
START one of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be UNK to heating STOP
START as you know , a UNK makes UNK air cool by UNK the heat out of it and then UNK this heat UNK STOP
START a relatively simple UNK arrangement UNK the cycle so that the machine literally runs backward , and the heat is UNK from outdoor air and turned UNK STOP
START up until recently , this heat UNK method of UNK air was efficient only in areas of UNK UNK and when outside temperatures were above 40 degrees STOP
START now , the machine has been improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures down to 15 degrees STOP
START you can get this added heating feature for as little as UNK more than the price of cooling alone STOP
START consider it as a UNK UNK , at UNK cost , for those UNK when the UNK UNK , a UNK holds up UNK delivery , or for cool summer UNK or UNK when you don't want to start up your whole heating plant STOP
START what size UNK ? ? STOP
START how large a cooling unit you need , and the method of its installation , depends on a variety of factors STOP
START among other things , besides the nature of your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from the outside , it will depend upon your personal habits and the UNK of your family STOP
START families with children usually don't want the house quite so cool STOP
START if you are a party UNK , you may need added capacity STOP
START the body is a heat machine , and 20 to 25 guests can easily double your cooling load STOP
START cooling requirements are best expressed in terms of aj STOP
START a UNK is a unit of heat , and the UNK UNK of a UNK refers to how much heat your machine can UNK out of your house in an hour STOP
START a very rough rule of UNK is that , under favorable conditions , you'll need 15 UNK of cooling for every square foot of your house STOP
START this is if outdoor temperatures have a high average of UNK degrees STOP
START you'll need more if the high average is above that , less if it's below STOP
START UNK are also UNK by tons STOP
START a ton of cooling UNK to the cooling you get by melting a ton of ice STOP
START by accepted definition , a UNK UNK will provide UNK UNK of cooling in one hour STOP
START you may find a UNK UNK by UNK STOP
START it is generally an UNK method of UNK , for the UNK is that of the UNK motor , and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you'll get STOP
START a UNK UNK , for example , may vary in effectiveness from under UNK UNK to well over 10,000 aj STOP
START the UNK procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need , rather than trying to do this yourself STOP
START don't urge your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough STOP
START better to have your equipment slightly UNK than too big STOP
START UNK why : STOP
START reducing UNK is often as important as cooling STOP
START an UNK unit will cool off your house quickly , then shut down for a long period STOP
START before it UNK on again , UNK can build up and make you UNK even though the temperature is still low STOP
START with a unit of the right size , a UNK will run continuously during hot weather , reducing UNK as UNK as it does temperature STOP
START UNK UNK STOP
START attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and UNK operating expense UNK STOP
START a UNK , UNK house can be UNK cooled and heated for as little as UNK a year , or UNK a month STOP
START if you have a house which heat doesn't UNK easily , your unit will have less heat to remove STOP
START keep the direct sun from reaching the house and you've won the first battle STOP
START in a new house , generous roof UNK are a logical and effective solution STOP
START if the house you plan to buy or build won't have big UNK , you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed UNK , fences and UNK STOP
START shade trees , too , are a big help , so keep them if you can STOP
START drawn UNK and UNK do some good , but not nearly as much as UNK devices on the outside of the house STOP
START the more directly the sun strikes walls and roof , the greater its heat impact STOP
START the way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you're going to need STOP
START a shift in the walls , or a change in the roof slope , so the sun UNK them more UNK , can save you money STOP
START you can use UNK glass to stop the sun , double glass and UNK glass to combat UNK STOP
START UNK large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house STOP
START they're easier to shade there STOP
START an UNK space above UNK makes a house easier to cool STOP
START you'll even gain by putting your water UNK outside the conditioned space , and using an electric range instead of a gas one STOP
START gas UNK to the UNK load STOP
START UNK , UNK , UNK to the maximum STOP
START in UNK , the numbers to remember are UNK STOP
START they stand for 6 inches of UNK UNK UNK in the ceiling , 4 inches in the side walls , 2 inches in the UNK STOP
START such UNK UNK not only permits a much smaller cooling installation , but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling STOP
START a UNK roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per cent STOP
START it costs two to three times as much to remove a UNK in summer as it does to add one in winter , so every UNK UNK is worth attention STOP
START you'll foil them in UNK , along with their UNK UNK , by having and using a kitchen range UNK UNK , a UNK UNK for when you UNK , and an outside UNK for the clothes UNK STOP
START keeping UNK quiet STOP
START it's no use UNK that all UNK are quiet , but the noise they produce can be kept to a minimum STOP
START good UNK is important in the installation , so if you're doing your own UNK , don't award the job on the basis of price alone STOP
START avoid UNK placement directly above a UNK STOP
START most recreation work calls for a good deal of UNK STOP
START this is particularly true in site selection STOP
START you must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are ; ; STOP
START you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed STOP
START with such a program you can make UNK UNK of the best sites available STOP
START begin the examination of a site with a good map and UNK UNK if possible STOP
START these are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies STOP
START the new UNK of UNK maps being made by the federal government are excellent for UNK yourself to the natural features of the site STOP
START these are UNK and available from the UNK society , washington 25 , UNK STOP
START in recent years many counties and the UNK service have taken UNK UNK which show features in detail and are very good for planning use STOP
START most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the UNK office showing UNK of land STOP
START UNK the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation STOP
START this gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions , the exposure to the sun and wind , the water interests , UNK , which vary greatly with the UNK STOP
START it is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take UNK at the site STOP
START these are a great aid for planning use back at the office STOP
START for site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park UNK to carry through the study STOP
START however , there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation STOP
START county judges , UNK , engineers , assessors , and others who have lived in the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences STOP
START a visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or UNK opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area STOP
START how much study is required ? ? STOP
START this , of course , depends on the character of the site itself , the previous experience of the UNK , and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision STOP
START it is too easy for the UNK person to make a quick judgment of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone STOP
START usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions STOP
START a site may be a UNK UNK or a UNK piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent UNK for the future with a little development or water STOP
START the same is true of areas which at first look good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use STOP
START in looking for the best sites available that meet the requirements , you need information to compare the site with others STOP
START you need answers to four important questions STOP
START what are the existing recreation features ? ? STOP
START how well can the site be developed ? ? STOP
START how useful will it be to the public ? ? STOP
START is this site available ? ? STOP
START check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests already existing at the site STOP
START naturally , a park site with UNK views , a good lake , trees , and sand UNK , will UNK more people than a nearby area with only trees and UNK STOP
START quality is UNK important STOP
START UNK on a body of clear , clean water will be UNK different from the same amount of UNK on UNK water STOP
START some recreation features , such as UNK values and water interest , also have greater UNK value than other interests STOP
START one of the most desirable features for a park are beautiful views or UNK STOP
START it may be distant views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake , colorful rock UNK , or unusual trees STOP
START a site which UNK a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic STOP
START an area on the coast may have UNK views of the UNK UNK in on a beach STOP
START a site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its trees and UNK STOP
START note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy STOP
START water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site STOP
START most park UNK look to water UNK for basic park areas STOP
START this follows naturally since UNK on an ocean , stream , or lake provides UNK values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of UNK , fishing , boating , and other water sports STOP
START a body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which UNK the greatest picnic and camping use STOP
START it also UNK the air in summer and UNK the trees and wild life STOP
START the amount of water UNK , the quantity and quality of the water , and the recreation UNK by it are important STOP
START a UNK UNK may be too UNK an area for public use STOP
START the quantity of water flow may be critical ; ; STOP
START a stream or pond which is attractive in the UNK may become UNK or dry in late summer STOP
START if the site is on a UNK , the level of the water at various UNK as it affects recreation should be studied STOP
START check the quality of the water STOP
START a stream which has all of its UNK within a national forest or other lands under good UNK practices is less likely to be affected by UNK than one passing through UNK UNK or past an industrial area STOP
START other factors , such as water temperature , depth of water , the fish life it UNK , wave action , UNK , UNK , will affect its recreation value STOP
START other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests , UNK , mountains , UNK , UNK , beaches , sand UNK , UNK , springs , UNK with which the area is UNK STOP
START just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which are of national or state significance , counties should seek out these features which are distinctive of their area STOP
START although the site may not contain the features themselves , there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site STOP
START the route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them STOP
START a group of native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can be UNK at the site STOP
START the fish , animals , and birds which may be found at the site are another interest STOP
START fishing interest calls for a check of the species found , quantity and size , the season they are available , and the UNK program of the fish commission STOP
START animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas STOP
START the site may be on one of the major UNK of UNK birds or have its own UNK bird life STOP
START UNK , UNK , and other marine life may add interest at UNK areas STOP
START each area has its own historical interests with which much can be done STOP
START park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in STOP
START the historical sign tells its story , but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the original historical items or places themselves which still have the character of the period covered STOP
START notice should be taken of unusual rock UNK , UNK , or shapes of the earth's UNK in your region STOP
START those which tell a story of the earth's formation in each area can add UNK interest to the recreation sites STOP
START an old UNK , a high UNK , an old covered bridge , a place to find UNK or other UNK UNK or a place to UNK gold , UNK may be of interest STOP
START some areas may provide UNK values such as ancient indian village sites or hunting areas , UNK , UNK , UNK STOP
START how well can the site be developed ? ? STOP
START look at the physical features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use , what can be done to correct the UNK , and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs in comparison to other sites STOP
START many things need to be checked : STOP
START size and shape STOP
START -- the size of the area alone can be a determining factor STOP
START an area may be too small for the needs of the project STOP
START areas should be large enough to include the UNK , have ample space for the use of facilities needed , and have room around the edges to protect the values of the area from UNK by private developments STOP
START UNK in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones STOP
START shape of the area is also related to the use UNK and needs of the development STOP
START a large picnic area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or UNK several hundred feet in width in UNK to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide STOP
START this is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful UNK equal in all directions STOP
START however , a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments , or to provide additional stream UNK for a UNK trail , or include UNK strips within the park unit STOP
START UNK areas STOP
START -- the values of the site may be affected by the appearance of the UNK lands , ownership and use of the land , and the UNK available there STOP
START for instance , a site UNK other publicly owned lands , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not STOP
START the UNK available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site STOP
START UNK STOP
START -- UNK is very important STOP
START check the UNK of the ground , degree and direction of UNK , UNK , rock UNK , UNK types and quality , as well as UNK STOP
START nearly level areas are required for parking areas , beaches , camp areas , UNK , UNK STOP
START determine how much UNK limits useful area or what the costs of earth moving or UNK might be STOP
START water STOP
START -- in addition to its recreation interests , water is needed for drinking , UNK , and UNK STOP
START the quantity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in site selection STOP
START the area may provide good springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines STOP
START figure the cost of providing water to the use areas STOP
START plants STOP
START -- the existing plant growth calls for thorough UNK STOP
START look at the trees as to size and interest , the amount of shade they provide , how healthy they are , the problems of maintenance , fire UNK , wind throw , UNK STOP
START an area may have been partially UNK and requires removal of UNK or UNK STOP
START some UNK may be of good UNK value , other areas of brush may need to be UNK STOP
START the extent and location of open areas is noted STOP
START exposure STOP
START -- how much will wind , rain , sun , and temperature affect the use ? ? STOP
START an area UNK from strong UNK may be highly desirable for recreation use STOP
START the direction , velocity , and season of these UNK should be noted as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area STOP
START lack of UNK and extreme temperatures may call for the development of shade and UNK of a site to make it UNK STOP
START sometimes , you have a choice of exposure for sites where the UNK or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade , morning sun , or whatever may be most desirable for the use intended STOP
START improvements STOP
START -- some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings , roads , UNK , UNK land , UNK which may raise the cost of the site STOP
START your UNK to write about UNK prokofieff to honor his UNK anniversary for the april issue of UNK UNK is accepted with pleasure , because i UNK the music of prokofieff ; ; STOP
START and with UNK purpose , because the development of prokofieff UNK , in many ways , the course of music in the union of soviet socialist UNK STOP
START the UNK prokofieff whom we knew in the united states of america was gay , UNK , UNK , full of UNK and UNK -- and very capable as a professional musician STOP
START these qualities UNK him to both the musicians and the UNK UNK UNK which supported the concert world of the UNK war 1 , era STOP
START UNK outlook as a UNK in america was , indeed , brilliant STOP
START UNK classical symphony was UNK as an UNK work from a naturally UNK and UNK musician still in his UNK STOP

START to the UNK , it was a challenge to the UNK world STOP
START what was it to prokofieff ? ? STOP
START a UNK UNK of UNK ideas ; ; STOP
START a trial UNK to test the aesthetic climate of the times ; ; STOP
START a brilliant piece de resistance ? ? STOP
START certainly its composer was an UNK UNK on a new world horizon STOP
START i heard the classical symphony for the first time when UNK conducted it in paris in 1927 STOP
START all musical paris was there STOP
START some musicians were enthusiastic , some UNK STOP
START i myself was one of the UNK ( UNK years ago ) STOP
START i remember UNK UNK in the UNK , UNK in his UNK voice : `` it may be a tour de force , UNK UNK UNK , can anyone take this music seriously '' ? ? STOP
START the answer is , `` yes '' ! ! STOP
START certainly , america took prokofieff and his classical symphony seriously , and with a good deal of pleasure STOP
START his UNK friend , UNK UNK , gave UNK of his UNK and brilliant performances in boston , new york , and washington , UNK , to which he added UNK and UNK for the whole nation STOP
START chicago was also a welcome host : there , in UNK , prokofieff conducted the world UNK of the love for three UNK , and played the first performance of his third piano UNK STOP
START `` uncle sam '' was , indeed , a rich uncle to prokofieff , in those UNK , UNK victory years of peace and UNK , UNK UNK and UNK , enjoyment and pleasure : `` the golden UNK '' STOP
START we attended the UNK of his UNK , UNK , and UNK ; ; STOP
START we studied , taught , and performed his piano UNK , chamber music , UNK , and UNK ; ; STOP
START we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities STOP
START we UNK agreed that prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first UNK of UNK UNK STOP
START nevertheless , prokofieff was much influenced by paris during the UNK : the paris which was the artistic center of the western world -- the social paris to which russian UNK UNK -- the UNK paris which attracted the UNK dollars of rich america -- the UNK paris of UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , picasso -- the UNK paris of UNK and UNK art -- the paris UNK which took young UNK to her UNK with such quick and easy UNK STOP
START so young prokofieff was the UNK of success : in his UNK ; ; STOP

START in the exciting UNK of his lovely , brilliant paris -- UNK of UNK -- excess and abandon -- world theatre of UNK UNK in tone , color , dance , design , and thought STOP
START meanwhile , three great terrible forces were UNK and UNK STOP
START in this world-wide UNK of men , minds , and machines , prokofieff was UNK to his native land STOP
START the world UNK when UNK UNK all concepts of peace and liberty , and the UNK , UNK peoples of the UNK and socialist UNK combined forces to UNK UNK UNK into UNK UNK STOP
START after this UNK , a changing world occupied the minds of men ; ; STOP
START a world UNK with new UNK , new UNK and governments , new goals and methods , and the UNK fears of UNK and UNK -- hunger and exposure STOP
START in this changed world , prokofieff settled to find himself , and to create for large national purpose STOP
START here , this happy , UNK son of good UNK proved that he could accept the UNK of a new UNK order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a UNK world STOP
START here , prokofieff became a UNK in the UNK of socialism -- producing music for the masses STOP
START it is at this point in his life that the mature prokofieff UNK STOP
START one might have expected that such a violent UNK of transition would have destroyed the creative UNK of a composer , especially one whose works were so UNK and spontaneous STOP
START but no : prokofieff grew STOP
START he accepted the environment of his destiny -- took root and grew to UNK the UNK of his early promise STOP
START by UNK he had UNK his UNK to serve his people : `` i have UNK for clarity and UNK UNK , but at the same time i have by no means attempted to UNK myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody STOP
START this is precisely what makes UNK , UNK music so difficult to UNK -- the clarity must be new , not old '' STOP
START how right he was ; ; STOP
START how clearly he saw the cultural UNK of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern UNK STOP
START and with what UNK did prokofieff back up his UNK of words -- with UNK of powerful music STOP
START compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his UNK and UNK little classical symphony and his big , UNK , UNK , and UNK fifth symphony ; ; STOP
START or the love for three UNK ( gay as it is ) with the wonderful , imaginative , colorful , and subtle UNK of the magnificent ballet , the stone UNK STOP
START this UNK has UNK , too , but it is the UNK of UNK people : UNK , UNK and humorous STOP
START of course , these works are not comparable , even though the same brain conceived them STOP
START the early works were conceived for a sophisticated , international audience ; ; STOP
START the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens STOP
START however , in all of UNK music , young or mature , we find his profile -- his `` UNK '' -- his UNK attitude STOP
START prokofieff never UNK his medium for the cause of experimentation per UNK STOP
START in UNK , he UNK the limits of UNK with good judgment and a fine imagination for color STOP
START his sense for UNK variety and UNK is UNK STOP
START his creative development of UNK designs of UNK dance UNK and love songs is UNK : UNK , UNK , UNK , and subtle STOP
START his UNK is pertinent , UNK , and rarely thick STOP
START also , it should be noted that the UNK freedom of his UNK and UNK UNK , the brilliant UNK , the UNK for UNK the UNK of UNK UNK , the skill in UNK UNK were not lost in his mature output , even in the spectacular historical UNK of the stage and UNK , where a large , dramatic UNK of sound was required STOP
START that UNK UNK and forms sometimes seem UNK routine to our ears , may or may not indicate that he was less of an `` original '' than we prefer to believe STOP
START need for UNK may be a UNK of cultural UNK and UNK STOP
START prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , helped preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the UNK UNK of current UNK may be eventually added and UNK STOP
START at this date , it seems probable that the name of UNK prokofieff will appear in the UNK of history , as an effective UNK , who was fully aware of the UNK and danger of experimentation , and used it as it served his purpose ; ; STOP
START yet was never caught up in it -- never a slave to its academic UNK STOP
START certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has UNK him to the western world -- not his UNK STOP
START so prokofieff was able to UNK his musical talents and UNK a rich UNK from them STOP
START nor can anyone be certain that prokofieff would have done better , or even as well , under different circumstances STOP
START his UNK , UNK UNK , certainly did not STOP
START why did prokofieff UNK in UNK and UNK , while UNK ( who UNK into fame like a young UNK ) UNK in UNK and UNK ? ? STOP
START i think the answer is to be found in UNK own words : `` the clarity must be new , not old '' STOP
START when prokofieff UNK his new clarity of `` UNK , UNK music , so difficult to UNK '' , he shaped his talents to his purpose STOP
START when UNK shaped his purpose to the UNK scenes of many cultures , many UNK , many UNK , many UNK , he tried to UNK himself into a UNK of many styles , determined by many UNK cultures STOP
START prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own people -- by the compass of their national ideas STOP
START but UNK was UNK by the attitudes of whatever culture he was UNK STOP
START in all his UNK , UNK made the fatal historical UNK of UNK that he could UNK other UNK UNK -- representing many peoples , time periods and styles -- into his own music by UNK the harmony , melody , or form , to UNK his own experiments STOP
START because of the UNK UNK of his early UNK materials , and his UNK for UNK -- his brilliant UNK , his UNK UNK du UNK , his UNK UNK UNK -- the world kept UNK that he could UNK the historical direction for which his native talents were UNK STOP
START but time is running out , and many of UNK UNK begin to fear that he will never find UNK UNK STOP
START his various aesthetic UNK remain as UNK of a house divided against itself : UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , and most recently , UNK -- all UNK with each other within one composer ! ! STOP
START what a UNK of UNK and UNK ! ! STOP

START UNK , UNK the age of UNK , is like a lost and UNK bird , UNK from one abandoned UNK to another , UNK for a home STOP
START how UNK UNK life UNK STOP
START prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a UNK changing world without losing his particular force and direction STOP
START in the process , his native UNK were UNK , UNK and UNK to serve their human purpose STOP
START with a large and UNK UNK technique , he UNK the materials of national heroes and events , national folklore and children's UNK tales -- UNK UNK and love songs -- into a solid musical literature which served his people well , and is providing much enjoyment to the world at large STOP

START thus in prokofieff the union of soviet socialist UNK produced one of the great UNK of the twentieth century STOP
START that his UNK , even in his early years , are those of his people , does him honor , as his music UNK those who inspired it STOP
START that he UNK every aspect of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary judgments , is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of UNK and UNK the UNK of a new culture ; ; STOP
START and perhaps of even greater significance -- his music is strong UNK evidence of the effectiveness of evolution , based on a broad UNK for the creative art of music STOP
START april 10 marked a UNK date in new UNK musical history -- indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern united states STOP
START on that date the musicians emergency fund , organized to furnish employment for musicians unable to obtain UNK during the depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their UNK in the stock market UNK , observed its UNK anniversary STOP
START roy mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a UNK with the english UNK of the early nineteenth century , especially the UNK UNK art of john sell UNK STOP
START and like this english master , mason UNK his subjects in large , UNK masses which , though they seem UNK , are in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough UNK of the natural form that inspired them STOP
START as a boy roy mason began the long process of UNK the UNK of the UNK , its UNK of weather , its change of UNK , its variable UNK STOP
START his father , a professional UNK and an amateur landscape painter , took his sons on numerous hunting UNK , and UNK to them his knowledge and love of nature STOP
START out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that roy first painted subjects he knew best : UNK in the field , UNK in the stream , UNK and UNK on the UNK -- almost always against a vast UNK of weather landscape STOP
START it is this subject matter that has brought mason a large and enthusiastic following among UNK , but it is his exceptional performance with this UNK that UNK him to artists and UNK UNK STOP
START mason had to earn the privilege of UNK himself exclusively to painting STOP
START like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family business which , though it was UNK to art of a kind -- the design and production of UNK UNK -- bore no relation to the painting of pictures STOP
START but it did teach roy the basic techniques of commercial art , and later , for twelve years , he and his sister UNK conducted an advertising art UNK in philadelphia STOP
START on the death of their father , they returned to their home in UNK , new york STOP
START after more years of concentrated effort , roy and his brother UNK finally established a UNK family business at the old stand STOP
START during all this time roy continued to paint , first only on UNK , and then , as the family business permitted , for longer periods STOP
START gradually he UNK from the shop altogether , and for the past thirty years , he has worked independently as a painter , except for his continued hunting and fishing UNK STOP
START but even on these , the UNK often takes over while the UNK UNK off ! ! STOP
START except for a rich friendship with the painter , UNK UNK who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had -- and this was limited to a few UNK , though the two artists often went on painting trips together -- roy developed his art by himself STOP
START in the best tradition , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and then to paint STOP
START he worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early UNK , including his election to the academy , were for his UNK in the UNK medium STOP
START gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique STOP
START it has been my privilege to paint with roy mason on numerous occasions , mostly in the UNK of UNK STOP
START more often than not i have found easy UNK to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where i could watch this man UNK raw nature into a composed , not UNK , painting STOP
START what i have observed time and time again is a process of integration , integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes on UNK form ; ; STOP
START color patterns that are made to UNK throughout the whole composition ; ; STOP
START and that over-all , amazing control of large UNK which is the mason UNK STOP
START finally come those little UNK of a UNK brush and the job is done STOP
START UNK -- yes ; ; STOP
START UNK -- maybe ; ; STOP
START UNK -- no ! ! STOP
START but for the technical fact , we have the UNK own testimony : STOP
START `` of late years , i find that i like best to work UNK STOP
START first i make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately af inches ) in which i pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values -- the UNK light , the middle tone , and the UNK dark -- by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns STOP
START if a human figure or wild life are to be part of the UNK final picture , i try to place them in the initial sketch STOP
START for me , these will belong more completely to their UNK if they are conceived in this early stage , though i freely admit that i do not UNK to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose STOP
START `` i am thoroughly convinced that most UNK suffer because the artist UNK nature will do his UNK for him ; ; STOP
START as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him STOP
START just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting , unless the position serves the design of the whole composition STOP
START if the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design , often only slightly , UNK pictures would result STOP
START out of long experience i have found that UNK figures and other objects like trees , UNK , and UNK can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which i call UNK STOP
START `` speed in painting a picture is valid only when it UNK UNK and UNK , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do well to take these first sketches and UNK UNK their design to achieve a UNK composition STOP
START `` if i have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition , i mean to project equal concern for color STOP
START often , in working UNK under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright , too UNK , or too light , or too dark when viewed UNK in a UNK STOP
START when this occurs , i make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor -- if i have been working on a full sheet in the field STOP
START `` when working from one of my sketches i square it up and project its linear form UNK to the watercolor sheet with UNK STOP
START when this linear draft is completed , i dust it down to a UNK image STOP
START from this point , i paint in as direct a manner as possible , by flowing on the UNK with as pure a color mixture as i can manage STOP
START however , first i UNK study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines i have described STOP
START then i plan my attack : the parts i will finish first , the range of values , the UNK of minor details -- all in all , mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of UNK STOP
START the longer i work , the more i am sure that for me , at least , a UNK method is important STOP
START trial and error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in UNK for UNK in the final painting STOP
START `` as for materials , i use the best available STOP
START i work on a watercolor UNK in the field , and frequently UNK to a large garden UNK to protect my eyes from UNK strain STOP
START in my UNK i work at a UNK table , but leave the paper UNK so that i can move it freely to control the UNK STOP
START i have used a variety of UNK UNK papers , but prefer an english make , rough surface , in UNK weight STOP
START after selecting a sheet and UNK it for UNK ( even the best sometimes has foreign ' UNK ' on its surface ) , i UNK it thoroughly on both sides with clean , cold water STOP
START then i dry the sheet under UNK pressure so that it will lie flat as a board STOP
START `` in addition to the usual tools , i make constant use of UNK tissue , not only to UNK my UNK , but to UNK up certain areas , to UNK edges , and to open up lights in dark UNK STOP
START the great UNK of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control than a UNK makes it an ideal tool for the UNK STOP
START i also use a small electric UNK to dry large UNK in the UNK STOP
START `` my UNK are different from those used by most UNK , for i combine the UNK and the UNK STOP
START the red UNK are 8 ; ; STOP
START two UNK , 6 and 10 ; ; STOP
START and a very large , flat wash brush STOP
START the UNK are a UNK 2 and a UNK inch brush UNK to a sharp UNK edge STOP
START `` my usual UNK consists of UNK colors : UNK UNK , UNK , raw UNK , raw UNK , UNK UNK , UNK , UNK blue , UNK blue , french UNK blue , UNK green , UNK green 2 , UNK yellow pale , yellow UNK , UNK gray , UNK gray , UNK gray , and UNK black '' STOP
START in UNK the UNK of roy mason , the first thing that comes to mind is their essential UNK , yet this word has such a varied UNK that it needs some UNK here STOP
START true , a mason watercolor is UNK a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory STOP
START unlike many UNK patterns that present a UNK flat convention , this UNK pictures are full of atmosphere and climate STOP
START long observation has taught mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a UNK in sharp focus -- either a light area with dark UNK or a dark one with lights ; ; STOP
START a middle distance often containing the major UNK ; ; STOP
START and a background , usually a UNK form UNK against the sky STOP
START in following this general principle , mason provides the observer with a natural eye UNK from UNK to background , and the illusion of depth is UNK created STOP
START when painting , UNK physical eyes are UNK , while his UNK eye is wide open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to UNK STOP
START he does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ; ; STOP
START rather his pictures UNK the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his UNK STOP
START it is for this reason that roy UNK selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment STOP
START his pictures UNK , though they are inspired by a particular UNK ; ; STOP
START they UNK in terms of weather , UNK , earth , and people STOP
START by dealing with common landscape in an UNK way , roy mason has found a particular UNK in american landscape art STOP
START living with his UNK is a UNK experience of seeing nature UNK through the eyes of a sensitive UNK , a breath and UNK of the outdoor world to help man honor the creator of it all STOP
START the artist was born in UNK mills , new york , in UNK , and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to california , he lived in western new york , in UNK STOP
START when i looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be march UNK , i realized that roy was born under the right UNK sign for a UNK : the water sign of UNK ( february 18 UNK march 20 ) STOP
START and how very often a water plane is UNK in his UNK , and how appropriate that he should appear in american artist again , in his UNK month of march ! ! STOP
START over the years , beginning in UNK , mason has been awarded seventeen major UNK including two gold UNK ; ; STOP
START two UNK fund purchase awards ; ; STOP
START the joseph UNK UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START two american watercolor society UNK ; ; STOP
START the UNK purchase prize for watercolor , art institute of chicago ; ; STOP
START and others in UNK , new york , UNK , new UNK , UNK , UNK , and most recently , the UNK prize for a watercolor at the UNK beach art association , STOP
START he was elected to the national academy of design as an associate in the oil class in UNK ( after receiving his first UNK fund purchase prize at the academy in UNK ) , and UNK to UNK in 1940 STOP
START other UNK include the american watercolor society , philadelphia water color club , UNK artists of america , UNK artists , baltimore watercolor society STOP
START the russian UNK beat the tar out of the american UNK in the 1960 UNK for one reason -- they were better STOP
START they were better trained , better looking , better built , better UNK and something else -- they were better dancers STOP
START our UNK are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance STOP
START the russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics STOP
START but why gymnastics at all ? ? STOP
START and is the UNK really important ? ? STOP
START after all , we did pretty well in some other areas of the UNK competition STOP
START but if it is important , what can we do to improve ourselves ? ? STOP
START it is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics STOP
START taking first things first , UNK understand the UNK called gymnastics STOP
START it is made up of UNK , which might be said to start with a UNK , run through such UNK as UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK in nearly impossible combinations of UNK UNK and UNK and apparatus work STOP
START the apparatus used by UNK was once a common sight in american UNK , but about UNK it was dropped in favor of games STOP
START the parallel bars , horse , UNK , UNK , UNK bar , UNK , and UNK formerly in the school UNK were replaced by baseball , UNK , UNK and UNK STOP
START but the russians use gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one , endurance STOP
START the UNK must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , UNK , rhythm , courage , discipline , UNK and the desire for UNK STOP
START in short , gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great deal of character as well STOP
START the addition of endurance training later , when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury , provides that final quality that makes the top UNK , soldier or citizen STOP
START another reason UNK study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life STOP
START ( an UNK teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days STOP
START most UNK have been UNK UNK UNK for centuries STOP
START ) in most sports , as in most UNK of life , the UNK are on the side of those who begin young , and the russian UNK of 16 has at least UNK years of training behind him STOP
START the american is very UNK if he has three STOP
START if a nation wished to get a head start in physical UNK over all other nations , it would start its UNK students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large number of the problems that UNK american schools STOP
START first of the problems attacked would be UNK and emotional tension , since action UNK both STOP
START UNK enough , it is UNK that there would be less reading difficulty STOP
START certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer UNK ( it is the UNK child who UNK the worst UNK ) , and higher UNK UNK , since alert children work better STOP
START russia knows this , and that is why there were over UNK UNK for places as candidates for the UNK UNK team STOP
START UNK thousand won top UNK and a chance to try for the team itself STOP
START we could scarcely find UNK in our great land of over UNK million people STOP
START and what has UNK to do with all this ? ? STOP
START a great deal STOP
START UNK young UNK have studied dance before having the UNK training on apparatus STOP
START UNK , trained in UNK and coordinated movement , and UNK to rhythm , they presented the audiences in rome with one of the most beautiful UNK ever seen at any UNK contest STOP
START american audiences in particular learned two valuable UNK STOP
START they saw completely UNK and obviously UNK men UNK with incredible grace STOP
START they were further UNK of old UNK tales by seeing the UNK , lovely russian girls UNK UNK requiring tremendous strength and with not one UNK muscle STOP
START president kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation STOP
START if we wait until children are in junior high or high school , we will never manage it STOP
START to be fit , one has to start early with young children , and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance STOP
START if the dance teachers of america make it their business to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come some day if our schools are really responsible , we will be that much ahead STOP
START school teachers , all too UNK for the job they must do , will need UNK STOP
START there should be UNK who know how to do a UNK , and also how to help other children learn it STOP
START they should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught STOP
START dance teachers can respond to president UNK request not only through their regular dance work , but also through the kind of basic UNK work that makes for strength and flexibility STOP
START very little in today's living provides the strength we need and nothing provides the flexibility STOP
START dancers do have flexibility STOP
START they often fail , however , to develop real UNK , back , chest , shoulder and arm strength STOP
START ask any group of UNK to do ten UNK or three UNK and the results , considering the amount of physical training they have had , will be very UNK STOP
START even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas STOP
START this isn't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the UNK boys in america cannot UNK themselves once , and that english school girls UNK them in almost every test ( even UNK and endurance ) STOP
START the only area in which american boys hold their own is the baseball throw STOP
START the UNK bar STOP
START for arm and shoulder strength a UNK bar is recommended STOP
START it should be installed over a door that is in full view of everyone , and a chair should be placed under it , a little to one side STOP
START those children who can UNK themselves should be told to do one UNK each time they pass under it STOP
START those who are too weak , should UNK on the chair and , starting at the top of the UNK , let themselves slowly down STOP
START when they can take ten UNK to accomplish the UNK , they will have the strength to UNK STOP
START parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home STOP
START the horse UNK STOP
START arm , shoulder , chest , upper and lower back strength will be UNK with the horse UNK STOP
START start on hands and feet STOP
START keeping the hands in the starting position , run in place to a quick rhythm STOP
START after this has become easy , use UNK and UNK UNK , UNK higher and higher STOP
START follow this by UNK from one corner of the room to the other on all UNK , UNK as high as possible STOP
START UNK STOP
START UNK are essential , but few have the strength for them at first STOP
START start on the knees in a large circle STOP
START fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body down to rest on the floor STOP
START push back up and repeat STOP
START do this exercise six times each class period STOP
START as strength UNK start in a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward STOP
START start by falling forward to a point close to the feet , and , as strength UNK , fall farther and farther out STOP
START try to push back to the stand position from the UNK position without any intermediate UNK from the hands STOP
START the UNK itself can be taught by starting at the top of the UNK with legs spread wide STOP
START let the body down slowly , taking at least five UNK for the letting down STOP
START five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one UNK STOP
START UNK STOP
START UNK come after arms , chest and shoulders have developed at least a minimum of strength STOP
START of course those who have developed more will find them easier STOP
START start with the class standing in a circle , with weight on the right foot and the left extended a little way into the circle STOP
START at first each child should do a UNK by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone , and those who need help STOP
START drop both hands to the floor and at the same time UNK the right foot up in back STOP
START the left will follow at once STOP
START the right will land first , followed by the left STOP
START return to the standing position STOP
START care should be taken to see that the hands are placed on the floor before the UNK starts and also that the landing foot is brought as close to the hands as possible STOP
START this will prevent flat falls and UNK UNK STOP
START UNK feet are better for such work than any form of UNK STOP
START eventually the class will be able to UNK up high enough so that the teacher can catch the leading leg STOP
START the child should then bring both legs together UNK , point the UNK and UNK the seat muscles STOP
START be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands at a time STOP
START UNK STOP
START the UNK is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics , and , as with all UNK , the UNK begun the better the results STOP
START have the class lie UNK with knees apart and bent STOP
START place flat UNK on either side of the head a few inches away from the ears , fingers pointing toward the shoulders STOP
START UNK the back UNK to make a bridge STOP
START be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor rather than toward the ceiling STOP
START as flexibility UNK , the feet will move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher STOP
START later this can be combined with the UNK to provide a UNK STOP
START back circle STOP
START to further increase back flexibility , work on the back circle STOP
START have the class lie UNK STOP
START place the hands in front of the chest STOP
START keep the legs straight and the UNK pointed STOP
START UNK the arms slowly , this UNK the back STOP
START at the peak of the UNK , tip the head back and UNK the knees in an effort to touch UNK to head STOP
START improvement can be measured by the UNK distance between UNK and head STOP
START UNK STOP
START the last essential to the UNK UNK program is the UNK , or forward roll STOP
START this used to be part of every child's bag of UNK , but few children can do it today ; ; STOP
START some are actually UNK of UNK forward and are completely confused when not sitting or standing UNK STOP
START for most small children , learning a forward roll is simply a matter of UNK another child who can STOP
START after it has been seen , have the child start on a UNK on hands and knees ( a thin , UNK UNK is quite sufficient for anything that does not require falling ) STOP
START he places the hands on either side of the head , keeping the UNK down on the chest STOP
START he then UNK his seat into the air and the teacher UNK it over STOP
START one or two practice runs should be sufficient for UNK STOP
START if , however , the child is weak , UNK , or afraid , more help will be needed STOP
START when the child raises his seat into the air , the teacher takes hold under both sides of the UNK ; ; STOP
START then no matter what happens , the child's performance will be controlled STOP
START by UNK the seat UNK a little , the weight is taken off the neck and the back is kept UNK STOP
START these are UNK , but correctly learned they prepare for UNK and exciting UNK that can be performed by a strong , flexible body ( we are not talking of UNK UNK ) STOP
START even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal , the good UNK will be a better dancer , a better UNK , and a human being with a greater UNK of safety in any activity STOP
START it is very important for parents to understand that early training is UNK STOP
START and UNK school , so helpful in artistic and psychological development , also UNK to this essential early training -- and can contribute even more STOP
START every UNK is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics STOP
START we have noted how some electronic techniques , developed for the defense effort , have UNK been used in commerce and industry STOP
START the host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more UNK because of their UNK in matters concerning our health and UNK STOP
START when we consider the electronic industry potential for human UNK , the prospect is UNK STOP
START the author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this area alone , the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities STOP
START the benefits electronics can bring to UNK may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery STOP
START we use the term `` UNK '' because of the close UNK between UNK and medical research STOP
START electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine , the UNK , and the UNK machine STOP
START recently many doctors have installed UNK UNK machines for deep UNK of UNK , UNK , and simple UNK STOP
START commonly used electronic devices which are found in practically every hospital are UNK tv and UNK systems for internal UNK and instruction , along with radiation UNK , UNK , and similar devices STOP
START in this article we will UNK on the advances in the application of electronics in UNK research UNK because this is where UNK commonplace equipment UNK STOP
START from the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques UNK in the past few years we have selected a few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research STOP
START ultraviolet UNK STOP
START many cells , UNK , and other microorganisms are UNK to visible light and must be stained for UNK investigation STOP
START this UNK often UNK the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside STOP
START a completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which UNK visible light with ultraviolet radiation and UNK a UNK with a UNK system to view the results STOP
START fig1 is a UNK block UNK of the ultraviolet UNK system developed at the medical electronics center of UNK institute STOP
START by UNK the talents of a medical man , UNK , a UNK , UNK , and an electronics expert , UNK , this novel technique has been developed which UNK to open broad UNK to understanding life processes STOP
START three different UNK of ultraviolet radiation are selected by the variable UNK placed in front of the three UNK UNK lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources STOP
START these UNK are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror ; ; STOP
START the specimen is UNK by the UNK STOP
START instead of the UNK eye the image UNK in the tv camera does the `` looking '' STOP
START the UNK and UNK are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum , which means that all UNK must be UNK STOP
START the UNK signal is UNK and then UNK , in UNK with the three ultraviolet light sources which are UNK by the rotating mirror so that during UNK of a second only one UNK , corresponding to red , green , or blue , is seen STOP
START ( note : because of light UNK from one ultraviolet source to another , the lights are UNK by a UNK assembly UNK by a UNK motor STOP
START this assembly also supplies a UNK UNK gate for the electronics UNK STOP
START ) this is the same system as was used in the UNK UNK system which UNK the present UNK system STOP
START three separate UNK then drive a UNK UNK tube STOP
START the result is a color picture of the specimen where the primary colors UNK to the three different ultraviolet UNK STOP
START many of the cells and microorganisms which are UNK to visible light , UNK or reflect the much shorter UNK of the ultraviolet spectrum STOP
START different parts of these cells sometimes UNK or reflect different UNK so that it is often possible to see internal UNK of cells in a different color STOP
START where the UNK under visible light may show only vague UNK or nothing at all , ultraviolet UNK and subsequent translation into a color tv picture reveal a wealth of detail STOP
START at the present time the research team which UNK this new technique is primarily interested in UNK and UNK it STOP
START UNK -- UNK analyzed STOP
START the medical title of `` UNK UNK in man '' by UNK and UNK , covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process STOP
START at the university of washington medical school , the electronics group has developed the `` respiratory gas UNK '' shown in UNK STOP
START this unit , UNK UNK `` the UNK '' , can be UNK to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's UNK STOP
START in the lower center UNK an UNK UNK indicates the percentage of carbon UNK and UNK from the upper and lower UNK of one lung , the total volume of UNK per breath , the flow of air from both UNK , and the pressure of the two UNK with respect to each other STOP
START usually the patient UNK into a UNK while walking a UNK , standing still , or in some other UNK significant position STOP
START from the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with UNK unknown accuracy and detail STOP
START UNK techniques STOP
START the original UNK primarily indicates UNK in the UNK , but today's techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the UNK , UNK of the heart and its UNK , and a much more detailed study of each UNK STOP
START for many of these measurements the chest must be opened , but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain UNK STOP
START a group of UNK at the university of washington have given a paper which briefly UNK some of these techniques STOP
START one simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin UNK tube , filled with UNK , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is UNK STOP
START a balanced resistance bridge and a UNK UNK are all the electronic UNK needed STOP
START UNK can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal UNK at opposite sides of the heart or blood UNK and exciting one with some UNK UNK energy STOP
START the travel time of sound in tissue is about UNK meters per second ; ; STOP
START thus it takes about 16 UNK UNK 25 UNK tissue STOP
START a UNK or UNK of UNK generator and UNK measuring system is required for UNK evaluation STOP
START in addition to the heart and UNK , successful measurements of liver and UNK have also been made by this technique STOP
START the UNK effect , using UNK signals , can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood UNK STOP
START a still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself STOP
START it uses both an UNK UNK arrangement of the heart and a UNK carrying a UNK inserted into the UNK STOP
START the latter measures the heat carried away by the UNK as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow STOP
START it is also possible to UNK a pressure UNK , mounted at the end of a UNK which is inserted into the UNK left UNK , to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself STOP
START this pressure measurement may be made at the same time that the UNK UNK measurement is made STOP
START a UNK version of the UNK for this procedure is shown in UNK STOP
START UNK of the two systems are measured by a UNK circuit and a resistance bridge , followed by a simple UNK UNK which UNK a UNK UNK STOP
START from this doctors can read heart rate , change in diameter , pressure , and effective heart power STOP
START UNK UNK STOP
START several years ago UNK were made by a small radio UNK UNK which could be UNK by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external UNK STOP
START this original UNK contained a battery and a UNK UNK and was about 1 UNK diameter STOP
START battery life limited the use of this `` UNK '' to about 8 to 30 hours maximum STOP
START a UNK of this technique has been described by UNK and UNK and UNK of the medical electronics center of the UNK institute STOP
START in this novel arrangement the `` UNK '' is much smaller and contains only a UNK circuit in which the UNK is formed by a UNK UNK STOP
START as shown in UNK , an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and UNK UNK times a second with short UNK STOP
START the energy received by the `` UNK '' causes the UNK circuit to `` ring '' on after the burst and this `` UNK '' takes place at the UNK frequency of the `` UNK '' STOP
START these frequencies are UNK and detected by the UNK UNK after each burst of UNK energy and , after the `` UNK '' has been UNK , precise internal pressure indications can be obtained STOP
START one of the advantages of this method is that the `` UNK '' can remain in the patient for several days , UNK observation under natural conditions STOP
START applications to UNK other than the UNK UNK are planned for future experiments STOP
START UNK in medical research STOP
START one of the most UNK applications of an important technique of submarine detection is in the exploration of the human body STOP
START our readers are familiar with the principles of UNK where sound waves are sent out in water and the UNK then indicate UNK objects STOP
START various methods of UNK , UNK , and UNK these sound waves are used to UNK submarines , map ocean UNK , and even UNK under water STOP
START in medicine the frequencies are much higher , UNK and the UNK beams themselves are much smaller , and different UNK techniques may be used , but the principles involved are the same as in UNK STOP
START because the body contains so much liquid , transmission of UNK signals UNK fairly well in muscles and blood vessels STOP
START bones and UNK UNK UNK and tend to reflect the UNK signals STOP
START based on this phenomenon , a number of investigators have used this method to `` look through '' human UNK STOP
START a good example of the results obtainable with UNK radiation is contained in papers presented by UNK who has UNK the human eye STOP
START he can UNK UNK of the UNK where conventional methods indicate blindness due to UNK STOP
START the method used to UNK the eye UNK is illustrated in UNK STOP
START the UNK is coupled to the body through a water UNK , not shown STOP
START for display , UNK uses a portion of an af , an UNK radar UNK , and then UNK the screen to obtain a permanent record STOP
START a typical `` UNK '' of a human eye , together with a description of the UNK parts , is shown in UNK STOP
START the frequency used for these experiments is 15 UNK the UNK is a UNK cut crystal with an UNK lens capable of providing beam UNK smaller than one UNK STOP
START the UNK itself moves the beam in a sector UNK , just like a radar antenna , while the entire UNK structure is moved over a UNK arc in front of the eye to `` look into '' all corners STOP
START the total picture is only seen by the camera which UNK the many sector UNK over the entire UNK UNK period STOP
START UNK and holmes at the university of UNK medical school have applied the same UNK technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results STOP
START by UNK the patient in a UNK and rotating the UNK while the UNK goes on , they have been able to get UNK views of the neck , as shown in fig7 , as well as many other UNK impossible insights STOP
START as mentioned before , bone reflects the sound energy and in fig7 the portion of the UNK shows as the black area in the center STOP
START arteries and UNK are apparent by their black , UNK centers and the surrounding white walls STOP
START a UNK of a normal lower human leg is shown in UNK with the various parts UNK STOP
START UNK UNK represented a minimal chance of either UNK UNK or serving his people so well and over so long a span of life STOP
START he was born in the small UNK town of UNK on the island of UNK in the UNK part of UNK on august 14 , UNK STOP
START his father UNK was the village UNK whose UNK income made it difficult to feed his family , let alone UNK them in a town without even a school STOP
START the two older boys , UNK and UNK , his junior by a year , therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly UNK nearby for instruction in german ; ; STOP
START his wife taught the two boys to read and write UNK STOP
START other brothers later joined them for instruction with UNK , the UNK , and also UNK was added to bible reading , german , and UNK in the UNK curriculum STOP
START UNK contributions were soon UNK and the boys had to turn to a wider circle of the UNK learned , such as the UNK , to supplement the simple teaching STOP
START from the town UNK , UNK learned drawing and mathematics and , from a university student , some academic subjects STOP
START the UNK of the town taught them english and french STOP
START whatever UNK or UNK learned UNK they passed on to each other ; ; STOP
START they read every book that they could UNK in the village STOP
START at 12 , UNK was sufficiently mature to help his father in the UNK shop , which helped UNK his interest in medicine and science STOP
START his earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life STOP
START in UNK the brothers decided to enter the university of UNK ( founded in UNK ) and the following spring found them at the university preparing to UNK for the UNK session STOP
START while UNK devoted himself to the sciences of medicine , physics , and astronomy , his brother studied law STOP
START the brothers continued to help each other during their studies , sharing a joint UNK , UNK together in the UNK and dining together at the home of their UNK STOP
START they UNK their income by small government assistance , by UNK and UNK wherever they could STOP
START so impressive were those serious years of study at the university that UNK later wrote , `` to be perfectly free , the young man must UNK in the great kingdom of thought and imagination ; ; STOP
START there is a struggle there , in which , if he falls , it is easy for him to rise again , there is freedom of UNK there , which draws after it no UNK consequences on society STOP
START i lived in this UNK contest where each day UNK a new difficulty , gained a new truth , or UNK a previous error '' STOP
START he openly UNK his pleasure in UNK and writing about science STOP
START in this third year at the university , UNK , in UNK , was awarded the first important UNK of recognition , a gold UNK for his essay on `` limits of poetry and prose '' STOP
START he completed his training in UNK also , taking his degree with high UNK in UNK , and in UNK was awarded the degree of doctor of philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine STOP
START he proposed a fresh theory of UNK which later was accepted in chemical practices STOP
START UNK of scientific activity STOP
START UNK student days were at a time when europe was in a new intellectual UNK following the UNK in america and in france , germany and italy were rising from UNK UNK and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was UNK the UNK STOP
START the new century opened with oersted beginning his professional career in charge of an UNK shop in UNK and as UNK at the university STOP
START he was UNK by the UNK of UNK discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the UNK UNK to experiments with UNK and UNK STOP
START the following year he devoted to the UNK `` UNK '' , traveling in germany , france , and the UNK , meeting the UNK UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START he also met count UNK ( born UNK thompson in UNK , UNK who was then serving the UNK of UNK , and the UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START these were UNK main contacts in science STOP
START from UNK ( UNK ) where he stayed for 10 days , he wrote , `` the first question asked everywhere is about UNK STOP
START as everybody is curious to see the battery of glass tubes i have UNK , i have had quite a small one made here of four glass tubes ( in UNK i used 30 ) and UNK to carry it with me '' STOP
START oersted joined UNK at UNK and stayed with him for 3 weeks , continuing their correspondence after he left STOP
START with UNK he was exposed to the fantastic UNK of ideas that UNK through his UNK UNK but UNK mind STOP
START oersted UNK UNK notes into an essay in french which was submitted to the UNK de france for its annual prize of UNK UNK STOP
START the sound UNK of this UNK genius were so UNK by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him STOP
START in may , UNK , UNK , in another flight of UNK , wrote to oersted a letter that contained a remarkable UNK STOP
START he related events on earth to UNK UNK phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum UNK of the UNK UNK with the years of important electrical UNK STOP
START thus , UNK UNK to the invention of the `` UNK '' jar by UNK , UNK that of the UNK by UNK , UNK produced the UNK of UNK , and UNK the UNK UNK STOP
START UNK proceeded , `` you now emerge into a new UNK in which late in the year UNK or UNK , you will have to UNK STOP
START this we might well witness '' STOP
START UNK died in UNK and oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it STOP
START in UNK oersted returned to UNK and applied for the UNK chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a UNK STOP
START however , he continued UNK and UNK , UNK the results of his experiments in german and UNK UNK STOP
START in UNK his UNK was realized and he became professor of physics at the UNK university , though not UNK full UNK ( UNK ) until UNK STOP
START during UNK UNK at the university , it was UNK equipped with physical apparatus for UNK in the sciences STOP
START he was , however , fortunate in his contact with UNK ( UNK ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in addition to his academic chair , was also UNK of the `` lion UNK '' in UNK where oersted UNK him STOP
START UNK maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at UNK disposal during and after his UNK STOP
START in UNK , UNK went abroad and oersted was appointed manager of the lion UNK STOP
START in february UNK , oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a UNK battery of UNK plates of UNK and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of UNK and lead STOP
START in the following year , UNK , oersted , simultaneously with UNK , discovered that UNK increased the strength of a UNK battery more than did UNK STOP
START eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded down with the management of the UNK and UNK in the medical and UNK UNK at the university that he could UNK only sunday UNK to `` UNK '' STOP
START he assumed his academic career with the same intensity and UNK that had marked every step in his rise from UNK STOP
START the university was the only one in UNK and the status of professor represented the upper social level STOP
START his broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movements opened many UNK to him STOP
START his friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong STOP
START the years UNK and UNK saw him in germany and france again , but on this visit to berlin he did not seek out the UNK as he had on his first journey STOP
START in berlin he published his views of the chemical laws of nature in german and this was issued in french translation ( paris , UNK ) under the title UNK UNK UNK UNK forces UNK et UNK , a work held in very high UNK by the new generation of research UNK STOP
START his interest in finding a relationship between UNK electricity and UNK is here first indicated STOP
START chapter 8 , is entitled `` on UNK '' and in it are included such remarks as , `` one has always been UNK to compare the magnetic forces with the electrical forces STOP
START the great UNK between electrical and magnetic UNK and UNK and the UNK of their laws necessarily would bring about this comparison STOP
START it is true , that nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication ; ; STOP
START but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the UNK difference STOP
START the form of UNK activity is UNK between the magnetic form and the electrical form STOP
START there , forces are more UNK than in electricity , and less than in UNK STOP
START but in such an important question , we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and UNK were only a difficulty , and not a thing which is contrary to it STOP
START one could also add to these UNK that steel UNK its UNK by heat , which UNK that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature , just as electrical bodies do STOP
START it is also found that UNK exists in all bodies of nature , as UNK by UNK and UNK STOP
START by that , one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical forces STOP
START an attempt should be made to see if electricity , in its most UNK stage , has any action on the UNK as such '' STOP
START his plan and UNK were clearly UNK STOP
START oersted returned in UNK and resumed an active part in university and political discussions STOP
START in one debate he supported the freedom of judgment as opposed to UNK , in another he held that the practice of science was in fact an act of religious worship STOP
START he continued as a popular UNK STOP
START he devised a UNK UNK in which a short wire was caused to UNK by an electric current STOP
START in UNK under royal command he UNK a very successful UNK UNK to UNK , one of the UNK islands , being one of three scientists in the UNK STOP
START it was with the assistance of one of the members of this UNK , UNK UNK , that oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric discharge in UNK vapor through which an electric current was made to flow STOP
START together they also developed a new form of UNK cell in which the wooden UNK was replaced by one of UNK , thereby producing stronger UNK STOP
START UNK was among those who UNK UNK first demonstration of his discovery STOP
START discovery of UNK STOP
START the association between electric ( both UNK and UNK ) forces and magnetic forces had been recognized by investigators for many decades STOP
START electrical literature contained numerous references to UNK that had UNK iron and had altered the UNK of compass UNK STOP
START in the late UNK UNK and van UNK , among others , had UNK iron by sending an UNK charge through it STOP
START UNK had almost UNK on a lead to the relationship between electricity and UNK when a discharge from a UNK jar was sent UNK through a piece of UNK steel making its ends magnetic STOP
START the resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made UNK STOP
START the experiments of UNK and others have already been noted but no one had determined the UNK relationship between these two primary forces STOP
START UNK own earlier experiments were UNK , possibly because he had , like other UNK , laid the UNK wire across the compass UNK instead of parallel with it STOP
START the sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the university related that the first direct event that led to the publication of UNK discovery occurred during a private UNK made before a group of other advanced students in the spring of UNK STOP
START at this UNK oersted happened to place the UNK wire over and parallel to a magnetic UNK STOP
START knowing specifically what the many feed UNK can do and how and when to feed them can make a highly competitive business more profitable for beef , dairy , and sheep men STOP

START caution : STOP
START UNK should not be fed UNK hours before animals are UNK STOP
START there are three principal feed UNK types for dairy and beef cattle : ( 1 ) UNK bunks -- cattle eat from one side while feed is put in from the opposite side of the UNK by UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START ( 2 ) UNK bunks -- they sit within the feed lot , are filled by a mechanical UNK above feeding surface ; ; STOP
START ( 3 ) special bunks -- as discussed here , they permit cattle to eat from all sides STOP
START feed is put in with an UNK STOP
START several materials or combinations of materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed UNK STOP
START the selection of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation , cost of materials available UNK , and your own UNK STOP
START no one material is best for all situations STOP
START selecting bunks by economic comparison is usually an individual problem STOP
START UNK feeding STOP
START animals eat only from one side , so the UNK UNK must be twice as long as the mechanical UNK STOP
START these bunks also serve as a UNK , so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the UNK STOP
START because of their location , on the edge of the feed lot , UNK bunks are not in the way of mechanical UNK removal STOP
START filling these bunks by the same UNK UNK used to fill UNK UNK cost of the UNK over more time and operations STOP
START UNK roads must be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all year STOP
START this will be a problem in areas of heavy UNK STOP
START marketing in the new decade will be no picnic -- for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last UNK UNK STOP
START why ? ? STOP
START companies of all types have made great advances in production capabilities and UNK -- in modern equipment and new processes , UNK r & d facilities , UNK new product development STOP
START many companies have UNK their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge STOP
START given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 UNK ? STOP
START based on our experience with UNK , , we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups -- the market place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management STOP
START 1 STOP
START problems in the market STOP
START greater UNK STOP
START there has been an UNK of UNK in recent years ; ; STOP
START there is every indication it will continue STOP
START frequently , UNK or UNK , UNK has been UNK by manufacturers , UNK , and dealers STOP
START despite generally good levels of income , we see greater price pressures than ever before -- traveling back along the chain from consumer to UNK to manufacturer STOP
START here are some key areas to examine to make sure your UNK strategy will be on target : STOP
START has the probable price situation in your field been UNK as a basis for future planning ? ? STOP
START have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse ? ? STOP
START have you actually checked out ( not just UNK tested ) different selling approaches designed to UNK the price competition problem ? ? STOP
START increased customer UNK STOP
START average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claims , partly because of widespread criticism of such UNK STOP
START this problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of businesses STOP
START have you examined this problem of increasing consumer UNK from the UNK of your own company ? ? STOP
START greater demand for services STOP
START need for service is here to stay -- and the problem is going to be UNK to solve in the sixties STOP
START there are two reasons for this STOP
START first , most products tend to become more complex STOP
START second , in a competitive market , the customer feels his weight and UNK it around STOP
START providing good customer service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product STOP
START too often it is thought of at the last moment of new product introduction STOP
START good service starts with product design and planning : many products seem to be designed for a production economy , not for a service one STOP
START proper UNK requires training your own sales organization , and your UNK organizations , not only in the techniques but also in good customer relations STOP
START have you UNK the importance of service and given it proper attention ? ? STOP
START wider UNK UNK for customers STOP
START in spending his money today , the consumer is pulled in many directions STOP
START to the manufacturer of the more UNK product -- the purchase of which can be UNK , delayed , or put off entirely -- the implications are important STOP
START your competition is now UNK greater -- you are UNK not only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast UNK of manufacturers of other UNK consumer products STOP
START many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or UNK the share of the UNK dollar being spent on their particular products STOP
START has your company thought through its strategy in this whole `` UNK buying '' area ? ? STOP
START UNK shift of customers STOP
START the trends have been in evidence for many years -- population shifts to the southwest and far west , and from city to suburbs STOP
START these shifts will continue in the next 10 UNK STOP
START have you considered the implications of continuing UNK shifts in terms of sales force allocation , strength of UNK organizations , and even plant location ? ? STOP
START market concentration and distribution in fewer accounts STOP
START we have already UNK great changes through UNK and UNK in the food industry -- at both the manufacturing and retail ends STOP
START instead of relatively small sales to many accounts , there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts STOP
START the change may require different products , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , advertising and executive attention -- practically every UNK in the marketing network may have to be adjusted STOP
START have you examined these trends , UNK the effects , and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstances ? ? STOP
START 2 STOP
START problems in marketing methods STOP
START more private UNK competition STOP
START in the area of private UNK competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade STOP
START as mass dealer and UNK organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the UNK as well as the UNK profits -- which is , in effect , what the sale of private UNK tends to do STOP
START average manufacturer frequently has helped build private UNK business , UNK largely the same qualities and styles in private UNK UNK as in UNK STOP
START moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution UNK and chain stores have insisted on high quality -- and the customer seems to have caught on STOP
START if you are up against private UNK competition , have you formulated a long-term program for UNK and UNK your market position ? ? STOP
START if private UNK competition UNK been felt in your product field as yet , have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ? ? STOP
START less personal UNK STOP
START display UNK , UNK by UNK through advertising and promotion , will continue to make UNK in the sixties STOP
START it has multiple implications and possible UNK for your marketing program STOP
START how can you cash in on this UNK type of UNK and still maintain relationships with older existing UNK which are still important ? ? STOP
START if you have a UNK product , how can you make it stand out -- justify its UNK price -- without the spoken word ? ? STOP
START UNK is still necessary , but it's a different UNK of UNK STOP
START have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products ? ? STOP
START have you studied the UNK and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements for effective marketing ? ? STOP
START are you UNK with different selling UNK in developing new customers ? ? STOP
START higher costs of distribution generally STOP
START some distribution costs are kept up by competitive pressure , some by the fact that the customers have come to expect certain UNK and UNK STOP
START no manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out the costs involved STOP
START the use of UNK handling is continuously growing STOP
START UNK are being used to keep branch inventories at more UNK levels STOP
START `` selective selling '' -- UNK sales on the larger accounts -- has been used effectively by some manufacturers STOP
START there may be possible UNK at any one of a number of UNK in your marketing and distribution chain STOP
START do you have a program for UNK all these UNK regularly and carefully -- and with some imagination ? ? STOP
START in your sales force , will a smaller number of UNK , UNK salesmen serve you best , or can you make out better with a larger number of UNK salesmen ? ? STOP
START will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer UNK in return for some benefit they can share ? ? STOP
START in one company covering the country with a UNK sales force of 10 men , the president personally UNK each major account every 6 UNK STOP
START as a result , distribution costs were cut , customer relations improved STOP
START distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties -- and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job STOP
START higher costs of advertising and promotion STOP
START from the UNK point of view , the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties STOP
START it is UNK by the need for UNK goods , and private UNK competition STOP
START how much fundamental thinking and research has your company done on its advertising program ? ? STOP
START are you following competition UNK -- trying to match dollar for dollar -- or are you UNK with new means for reaching and UNK UNK ? ? STOP
START have you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program -- from the UNK of effort , money , and effectiveness ? ? STOP
START increasing UNK of new product development STOP
START practically all UNK mention new and exciting products on the horizon STOP
START will you be out in the market place with some of these UNK new products ? ? STOP
START if competition UNK you to it , this exciting new product era can have real UNK in store STOP
START on the other hand , the process of UNK an old product and UNK the new one is usually mighty expensive STOP
START as markets become larger and marketing more complex , the costs of an error become UNK larger STOP
START is your r & d or product development program UNK in to the commercial realities of the market ? ? STOP
START are there regular communications from the field , or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with r & d people ? ? STOP
START technical knowledge is a wonderful thing , but it's UNK unless it eventually UNK the cash register STOP
START are there individuals in your organization who can UNK a new product through to UNK ; ; STOP
START who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume , production , and distribution costs ; ; STOP
START and UNK the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which management can act on with some assurance ? ? STOP
START we have seen good new products UNK because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans -- and management couldn't make up its mind STOP
START 3 STOP
START problems in marketing management STOP
START UNK of skilled salesmen STOP
START there is a UNK of salesmen today STOP
START in the future , UNK demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy , and the UNK need will be greater still STOP
START while many companies have done fine work in developing sales personnel , much of it has been product rather than sales training STOP
START nor has the training been enough in relation to the need STOP
START most marketing people agree it is going to take UNK efforts to satisfy future requirements STOP
START have you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future ( both UNK and UNK ) ? ? STOP
START has your company developed selection and training processes that are UNK to providing the UNK of salesmen you will need in the next 10 UNK ? STOP
START UNK of sales management talent STOP
START with the growing UNK of markets and intensity of competition , sales management , whether at the district , region or headquarters level , is a tough job today -- and it will be UNK in the future STOP
START men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more UNK due to the demanding combination of UNK called for by this type of management work STOP
START the growth of business has UNK the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties STOP
START does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel for the longer term ? ? STOP
START does your management climate and your management compensation plan UNK and keep UNK marketing people ? ? STOP
START UNK of complete marketing planning STOP
START every single problem UNK on thus far is related to good marketing planning STOP
START `` UNK '' tactics are going to be harder to apply STOP
START many food and UNK companies are already on a highly planned basis STOP
START they have to be STOP
START with greater UNK in plant facilities , with UNK growing , you can't switch around , either in volume or in product design , as much as was formerly possible -- or at least not as UNK STOP
START are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently in your company ? ? STOP
START we find too many sales and marketing UNK so UNK with detail that they are UNK planning STOP
START are annual marketing plans UNK throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the marketing team ? ? STOP
START do you have a long-term ( UNK or UNK marketing program ? ? STOP
START the key to effective marketing is UNK up in UNK your company's marketing problems UNK STOP
START solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately UNK your problems , whether they be in the market , in marketing methods or in marketing management STOP
START if companies will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problems and to the questions they UNK , then a long UNK step will have been taken toward more effective marketing in next decade STOP
START the controversy of the last few years over whether UNK or interior designers should plan the UNK of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference of opinion STOP
START the UNK do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior designer is UNK of understanding the UNK principles involved in planning the interior of a building STOP
START ordinary UNK may have UNK against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide UNK in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables , UNK or panel discussions -- whatever they are called -- on this subject will recognize that the final , UNK down UNK of the matter is education STOP
START it is true that most UNK schools have five year courses , some even have six or more STOP
START the element of public danger which enters so largely into UNK UNK , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure STOP
START this would , naturally , UNK their courses far beyond the largely UNK demands of interior UNK training STOP
START we may then UNK the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior design student as not having serious bearing on the subject STOP
START the real question that follows is -- how are those four years used and what is their value as training ? ? STOP
START the american institute of interior designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage UNK of such a course STOP
START an examination of some forty UNK of schools offering courses in interior design , for the most part schools UNK by membership in the national association of schools of art , and a further `` on the spot '' inspection of a number of schools , show their courses UNK pretty closely to the recommendations STOP
START one or two of the schools have a five year curriculum , but the usual pattern of american education has limited most of them to the UNK plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions STOP
START the suggested course of the UNK based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many UNK as to UNK necessities STOP
START obviously , the four year provision limits this to UNK and much desirable material must be eliminated STOP
START without UNK the relative UNK of the two courses -- UNK UNK interior design -- let us examine the educational needs of the interior designer STOP
START to begin with , what is an interior designer ? ? STOP
START `` the dictionary of occupational UNK '' published by the UNK of labor describes him as follows : `` designs , plans and UNK UNK of houses , commercial and UNK structures , UNK , UNK , ships , UNK , as well as set UNK for motion picture arts and television STOP
START makes UNK and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture , floor UNK , wall UNK , and determines color UNK STOP
START UNK complete cost estimates for UNK approval STOP
START makes necessary purchases , places contracts , UNK construction , installation , UNK and placement of furniture , UNK and other UNK UNK , and follows through to completion of project '' STOP
START in addition to this the UNK service bureau , when UNK UNK for government positions as interior designers , UNK that `` when various needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them STOP
START he must be capable of UNK for and UNK the manufacture of any UNK materials needed in the UNK '' STOP
START this seems like a large order STOP
START the interior designer , then , must first be an artist but also understand UNK and painting and lighting and UNK and finance STOP
START yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any UNK interior designer does know all this and does practice it STOP
START and further he must understand his obligation to the UNK to not only meet his physical necessities but also to UNK and improve his life and to UNK the cultural horizon of our society STOP
START few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the UNK of their curriculum STOP
START it is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise STOP
START the old established independent art schools try their best to UNK their obligations STOP
START yet even here many a problem is presented ; ; STOP
START as in a recent design competition with a floor plan and the simple command -- `` design a luxury apartment '' ; ; STOP
START no description of the UNK or his cultural level , no UNK of geographical area or local social necessities -- simply `` a luxury apartment '' STOP
START working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show pieces that look good in UNK and UNK and may please the public relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior design STOP
START it is possible , of course , to work on UNK or UNK buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so that the student may get `` the feel '' of real interior design demands STOP
START unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem is the rule STOP
START it is like medical schools in india where , in that UNK of religious UNK , the UNK of dead bodies is UNK upon STOP
START instead they learn their UNK on the UNK of plants STOP
START thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience STOP
START in the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use STOP
START but to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is UNK STOP
START UNK with UNK , UNK , real estate men , fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work STOP
START fortunately , although only a few years ago they held the student at arms length , today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of UNK -- that the student already is `` in the trade '' STOP
START even the `` history of furniture '' can hardly be taught exclusively from UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experienced STOP
START the professional organizations such as american institute of interior designers , national society of interior designers , home UNK league and various trade associations , can and do aid greatly in this work STOP
START certainly every UNK involved in interior design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations STOP
START not only should every UNK above the rank of UNK be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations , but his first UNK for membership as an UNK should be so sharply UNK that membership would be equivalent to UNK to teach the subject STOP
START participation for the UNK in this case , however , would have to be raised to full and complete membership STOP
START the largest of these organizations at present UNK to the full time UNK any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , UNK him even the right to UNK the UNK UNK after his name in the college UNK STOP
START this UNK status of the UNK cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students STOP
START the professor in turn UNK not UNK the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice STOP
START this seems somewhat UNK since if the absolute educational UNK for membership which the organizations UNK are ever enforced , the UNK will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands STOP
START in one way the UNK and societies do a UNK to the schools STOP
START that is in the UNK of the `` UNK UNK '' in their membership requirements STOP
START when these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished UNK could not have had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were rare and UNK during their youth STOP
START long hard years of `` on the job '' training had brought them to their competence STOP
START the necessity of that day has long disappeared STOP
START there is plenty of opportunity for proper education today STOP
START it is UNK for students to realize that the societies do not truly UNK the standards for which they are supposed to stand STOP
START the reason and the day of `` UNK UNK '' has long since passed STOP
START no one can deny that these `` back door '' UNK to membership provisions have been seriously UNK nor that they have not resulted in the admission of UNK UNK to membership in UNK learned societies STOP
START beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves STOP
START it will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education , a depth and UNK of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students STOP
START the local UNK who UNK in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these UNK STOP
START nor will the UNK , the UNK , still found in some of the smaller art schools , UNK STOP
START only a few years ago a middle western college UNK a request for a teacher of interior design STOP
START at the end of its letter was the information that UNK for this position `` must also be prepared to teach UNK design and advertising art '' STOP
START this kind of UNK toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer STOP
START we must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior design who have had education , experience in the profession and are willing to take on the usual UNK of teaching -- minimal income and minimal status among their UNK STOP
START considerable UNK in teaching subjects such as UNK , furniture design , UNK and color is also desirable STOP
START in all `` degree '' courses in interior design a number of `` academic '' or `` general studies '' courses are included STOP
START it is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in english , history , psychology and so on be as well informed in matters of art , especially interior design , as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects STOP
START the proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed STOP
START the matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken into account STOP
START one technical question of school organization comes to mind here STOP
START for proper UNK of schools , teachers in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a UNK STOP
START since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed STOP
START indeed , it has only been a matter of the last few years that UNK schools of art have granted degrees at all STOP
START the question , however , cannot be ignored for long STOP
START the basic problem involved is that a college setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree STOP
START most professors in the course must , naturally , again have a higher degree than the course offers STOP
START one solution is the UNK of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute STOP
START it is a sort of academic UNK and you solve it STOP
START this brings us to the question of UNK of art schools in general STOP
START only the independent art schools , that is , those not connected with any university or college , receive severe and separate investigation before UNK by the various regional organizations STOP
START it has been the custom for most universities to stretch the UNK of UNK for their liberal arts school to cover the UNK body of their fine arts department STOP
START this , plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics department , yet , nevertheless , UNK that they teach interior design , has contributed to the low UNK of many university courses in interior design STOP
START in spite of this , many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject STOP
START there will be no UNK of these UNK until all art schools , whether independent or attached to universities have separate UNK -- as do medical schools -- by an art UNK group such as the `` national association of schools of art '' STOP
START independent art schools UNK degrees must , naturally , follow this with academic UNK by the appropriate regional group STOP

START above all , don't set up UNK UNK benefits just to buy employee good will STOP
START UNK stress UNK benefits , but the individual UNK worker UNK cash every time STOP
START aim to balance your employee benefit package STOP
START some plants go UNK on one type of UNK -- say a liberal retirement plan -- and find themselves UNK elsewhere STOP
START they're asking for union trouble STOP
START communications STOP
START if you want credit for your employee services program , let your workers know what they're entitled to STOP
START encourage them to exercise their benefits STOP
START this can be done by stories in your house UNK , UNK , special publications , letters to UNK homes as well as by word of mouth through your chain of command STOP
START some companies find a little imagination helpful STOP
START UNK cards , UNK kansas city , UNK has a UNK UNK game called `` benefit UNK '' , which it UNK to employees STOP
START m & r UNK UNK , UNK UNK , gives all its workers a UNK UNK -- each check showing the amount the company UNK on a particular UNK STOP
START UNK company , new york , passes out a form UNK the value of benefits STOP
START the UNK worker thus knows his insurance package , for example , costs UNK STOP
START insurance STOP
START have the insurance company or your own accounting department break down the cost of your insurance package UNK STOP
START you may find certain coverage UNK much more than is UNK feasible , thereby UNK you to desirable UNK STOP
START check to see if some of your benefits -- such as UNK UNK pay -- can be put on a direct payment rather than an UNK basis at a savings to you STOP
START use UNK insurance wherever feasible STOP
START it can put an end to marginal claims which play UNK with your insurance rates STOP
START also , UNK of UNK policies , especially in the medical field STOP
START this will mean that every time there's an increase in hospital rates your cost will go up in like manner STOP
START put a UNK limit on benefits STOP
START don't go UNK on insurance that UNK benefits only upon death STOP
START generally , your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that protect him during his working life or during retirement STOP
START special time off STOP
START in UNK UNK leaves , specify the maximum time off and list what the UNK relation to the UNK must be to UNK STOP
START thus , you avoid UNK when an employee wants off for his fourth UNK UNK STOP
START also , reserve the right to demand proof of death despite the fact that you'll probably never use it STOP
START coffee UNK can be a real UNK if not UNK STOP
START UNK machines can UNK the long UNK to the UNK during the break with resulting waste of production time STOP
START if coffee is sold at the UNK , let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group STOP
START consider UNK UNK serving lines in production areas STOP
START make sure milk for the coffee is placed in UNK rather than in UNK , if you are supplying the coffee STOP
START otherwise , you may be UNK with a UNK milk bill by milk UNK STOP
START retirement policies STOP
START keep the retirement age flexible so skilled UNK such as tool and die makers can be kept on the job for the UNK of the company STOP
START and so UNK on the UNK can be UNK out at the earliest possible age STOP
START make sure you have minimum age and UNK requirements tied into your UNK plan STOP
START younger men usually don't think of UNK as an important job benefit factor UNK and they're UNK to change jobs several times before UNK down STOP
START choose carefully between UNK or UNK UNK plans STOP
START there are two sides of a UNK for this decision STOP
START workers usually think more of a plan they contribute to STOP
START and they can at least UNK the money they put in , plus interest , when they leave the company STOP
START a UNK plan usually won't pay off for the worker until he UNK STOP
START thus , there is an added UNK to stay on the job STOP
START UNK STOP
START make sure you don't pay for UNK that occur when an employee would not otherwise be working STOP
START these include : leaves of UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START consider UNK a system of UNK in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum UNK to the operation of the plant STOP
START it's usually not too hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods STOP
START for example , the friday after UNK can be substituted for UNK UNK STOP
START this UNK the number of expensive plant UNK and UNK STOP
START require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be UNK for pay STOP
START this cuts the UNK rate STOP
START UNK facilities STOP
START consider using UNK machines rather than UNK UNK STOP
START latest models serve hot meals at reasonable prices , and at a profit to you STOP
START if a UNK runs the UNK , keep an eye out for quality and price STOP
START if the UNK UNK like UNK , your employees won't UNK the UNK STOP
START you'll take the UNK STOP
START check your UNK location to make sure it's convenient for most employees STOP
START you may save valuable production minutes with a change STOP
START UNK STOP
START spread your vacation period over the UNK possible span of time or shut the plant down for two weeks STOP
START this will cut the expense of vacation UNK STOP
START and with the UNK method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates STOP
START also make sure you have reasonable requirements as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a vacation STOP
START you might try providing standard vacation time off but make the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous year STOP
START the long and UNK column of UNK is now moving into a new era STOP
START modern times have changed the world beyond recognition STOP
START the early years of the twentieth century seem very far away STOP
START but with all the changes in philosophy , dress and UNK -- a few things remain constant , including the devotion of americans to the great field sports , hunting and fishing STOP
START as the UNK move on , clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports STOP
START UNK UNK change , UNK for the better STOP
START just as modern transportation has UNK the early UNK covered wagon , the demand of today's UNK and women has UNK changes in their equipment STOP
START the american UNK and UNK manufacturers through UNK research and technical development have replaced the UNK UNK and UNK UNK arms with modern fast firing UNK , extremely accurate UNK , lever , and slide action UNK STOP
START and millions of UNK of entirely new and modern UNK UNK , designed for today's hunting and target shooting STOP
START and due to modern UNK and game management practices , there is still game to shoot , even with the UNK UNK on land and water STOP
START present UNK practices regard wildlife , not as an UNK natural UNK , but as an annual UNK to be UNK and also UNK STOP
START unlimited game UNK are possible and legal in more than 40 states , on shooting UNK ( one of the newer phases of modern UNK ) for five and six months each year STOP
START close to two million game birds were UNK on UNK commercial and private shooting UNK , and on state game UNK UNK game areas during the UNK season STOP
START the shooting development program of the UNK arms and UNK UNK institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines , many national UNK and the trade papers STOP
START the most effective way to develop more places for more UNK to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting UNK STOP
START this has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the new york staff of the UNK service bureau , and the UNK shooting preserve field UNK since the start of the program in 1954 STOP
START following the UNK of UNK shooting development program in 1954 , a most interesting meeting took place in washington , UNK STOP
START the group known as the american association for health , , physical education , and recreation ( a division of the national education association ) initiated a conference which brought together representatives of the national rifle association , UNK and the american fishing UNK manufacturers STOP
START this meeting was called to determine how these groups might UNK to UNK what is known as the outdoor education project STOP
START the outdoor education project took UNK of the fact , so often UNK , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life STOP
START the various team sports UNK have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development STOP
START but with the exception of professional UNK , few contact sports and physical education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average american man or woman STOP
START following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by UNK director UNK smith , today thousands of secondary schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical education and recreation programs STOP
START UNK financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education STOP
START personnel assigned through the shooting development program have UNK UNK in over UNK state and regional UNK , at which hundreds of school UNK , teachers , professors , and UNK leaders have been introduced to outdoor education STOP
START considering that the current UNK potential is 23 million UNK , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more to reach STOP
START in 1959 UNK shooting development program announced a new activity designed to UNK thousands of UNK boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports STOP
START this program is now UNK known as `` UNK UNK UNK '' STOP
START UNK UNK UNK were initially sponsored by UNK members of the UNK UNK corporation STOP
START the first program was sponsored by UNK & UNK , UNK , new york , under the direction of special events director UNK UNK STOP
START other pilot programs were conducted by a & s , UNK , new york ; ; STOP
START UNK , UNK ; ; STOP
START joseph UNK , UNK STOP
START other UNK activities followed , conducted by shopping centers , department stores , recreation equipment dealers , UNK stations , newspapers , and other organizations interested in the need existing to UNK UNK with the proper use of UNK UNK and the development of correct attitudes and UNK related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources STOP
START UNK field men have served as UNK and have UNK in 75 UNK UNK club activities which have reached over UNK enthusiastic young americans STOP
START through the efforts of UNK shooting development program these shooting activities , and many others , including UNK in the development of public and UNK financed shooting parks , trap and UNK UNK , rifle and UNK UNK programs have been UNK , to mention only a few STOP
START the continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the UNK need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand STOP
START while individual UNK are aware of this situation , too many of our political , social , educational and even religious leaders too often forget it STOP
START help is needed from dealers , at the UNK level STOP
START the american gun and UNK producers UNK a successful UNK program through their industry trade association STOP
START since UNK conception in UNK , and more specifically since the UNK of the shooting development program in 1954 , millions of dollars and UNK UNK have gone into the development of more places to shoot for more UNK and adults STOP
START we trust that you , as a gun and UNK dealer , have UNK through additional sales of equipment STOP
START are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports ? ? STOP
START are you looking ahead to the UNK market of millions of american boys and girls , who will grow up to enjoy a traditional american way of life -- ranging the fields with a fine american gun and UNK excellent UNK ? ? STOP
START is your UNK UNK and UNK department UNK for the expanding UNK ? ? STOP
START would you like to UNK UNK UNK UNK , shooting programs , and have information on UNK including six months of hunting with unlimited game UNK on shooting UNK ? ? STOP
START ask UNK UNK STOP
START we were camping a few weeks ago on UNK UNK UNK in that land of UNK , UNK and UNK on north UNK UNK outer banks STOP
START this beach UNK with no trees or hills presents a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual use STOP
START with the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of UNK shelters in which americans are camping now STOP
START there were UNK UNK , wall UNK , UNK UNK , station wagon UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , baker UNK , UNK with UNK frames , UNK trailers , travel trailers , and even a few surplus UNK serving as UNK over entire family camps STOP
START moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , games , fishing UNK , UNK and UNK STOP
START we saw similar displays in the other three UNK in this UNK national UNK recreation area STOP
START dealers would do well to visit such a UNK often , look at the equipment and talk with the UNK STOP
START here you begin to appreciate the scope of the UNK and possibilities facing the industry STOP
START camping is big and getting bigger STOP
START no one knows where it will stop STOP
START almost every official who reflects on it UNK this movement of americans to UNK UNK UNK one of the most promising of all outdoor markets STOP
START you read various UNK on how many americans are camping STOP
START the number depends on who is talking at the moment STOP
START the figures range as high as 15 million families STOP
START i've heard 10 million mentioned often , but i'm more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping STOP
START seven million families would total 30 million americans or more STOP
START consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather , to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable STOP
START more UNK than UNK STOP
START UNK state park officials often have more UNK than they know what to do with STOP
START they are struggling to meet the demand for camping space , but families are being turned away , especially on holiday UNK STOP
START the national parks , always popular camping places , are facing the same pressure STOP
START the national park service hopes by UNK to have UNK UNK available for UNK UNK a day -- almost twice what there are at present STOP
START the UNK service UNK for hundreds of thousands of UNK in its UNK national forests and is increasing its facilities steadily STOP
START but the UNK still come STOP
START they bring their families and UNK and camp UNK and UNK STOP
START they bring their fishing UNK and UNK and UNK suits STOP
START they come prepared for family fun because americans in UNK numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family experience of UNK importance STOP
START why they keep coming STOP
START there are a half dozen reasons helping to account for the UNK to the UNK STOP
START among them , according to the UNK of commerce , are : ( 1 ) shorter work weeks , ( 2 ) higher pay , ( 3 ) longer paid UNK , ( 4 ) better transportation , ( 5 ) earlier retirement , and ( 6 ) more education STOP
START the more people learn about their country , the more they want to learn STOP
START camping is family fun , and it is helping more americans see more of the country than they ever saw before STOP
START but make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn to camping is one of economy STOP
START here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford STOP
START the american automobile association , computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile , comes up with an average daily UNK figure of UNK STOP
START the UNK then UNK it down this way : UNK for meals , UNK for UNK , UNK for gas and oil , and UNK for UNK and UNK STOP
START what does the camping couple do to this set of figures ? ? STOP
START the UNK for UNK they save STOP
START because they prepare their own meals they also keep in their UNK a good portion of that UNK food bill along with most of the tip money STOP
START the automobile expenses are about the only UNK cost they can't either eliminate or UNK down UNK by camping along the way STOP
START where americans used to think of a single vacation each summer , they now think about how many UNK they can have STOP
START long UNK enable many to get away from home for three or four days several times a year STOP
START and even if they stay in UNK part of the time , they might , if the right UNK gets them in UNK , develop a UNK to UNK the usual vacation UNK with a camping trip into the wide open UNK STOP
START it would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning UNK on the idea they're buying the UNK of home STOP
START they're not STOP
START home is the place to find the UNK of home STOP
START they're buying fun and UNK and family experiences STOP
START but it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become STOP
START this is no longer a way of life for the UNK UNK and the UNK UNK STOP
START today's UNK want UNK , and they have them STOP
START and this helps explain why so many people are now going camping STOP
START it's fun , and it's easy -- so easy that there is time left after cooking , and UNK keeping , for the women to get out and enjoy outdoor fun with their families STOP
START camp meals are no great problem STOP
START neither are UNK , thanks to air UNK and sleeping UNK STOP
START neither are shelters , because there is one to meet the needs of every UNK or prospective UNK STOP
START but there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping UNK choose the best equipment for their individual needs STOP
START throughout history , the man who showed superior performance has become the commander of others -- for good or bad STOP
START since the industrial revolution , when factories emerged , this classical pattern has been followed STOP
START until recently STOP
START there have always been tales of UNK -- the competent UNK who became an UNK , UNK or not , and found he didn't like it ; ; STOP
START the UNK who UNK against the personnel and paper work ; ; STOP
START and much more commonly in recent years , the engineer who found that other duties UNK with -- or eliminated -- his engineering contributions STOP
START there have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into very UNK managers or UNK in paper work , to their own and the UNK UNK and loss STOP
START this has been more evident since our products have incorporated UNK increased technology STOP
START the UNK have been many and varied -- attempts to teach management techniques -- either in plant , at special schools , or in university `` UNK '' courses -- provision of UNK UNK or UNK STOP
START but the realization has been growing that these are not the complete answer STOP
START some men have no talent for or interest in management ; ; STOP
START UNK them into management can only create trouble STOP
START the old shop UNK still holds : `` a good UNK is usually a bad UNK '' STOP
START yet our economy UNK UNK to recognition of UNK status as the UNK of success STOP
START labor UNK to change its UNK from blue to white STOP
START all grades of management seek more UNK UNK and UNK because of social pressures STOP
START as several recent books have UNK , we have become the most UNK nation in the world STOP
START what can be done for the `` individual UNK '' who is extremely important -- and likely to be more so -- in the operation of the UNK UNK company ? ? STOP
START he is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and outside ; ; STOP
START usually concerned about america's belief that UNK and success are measured in dollars and UNK STOP
START yet UNK are UNK given only to management men , and income tends to rise with title STOP
START even the college professor in america has been affected STOP
START it is , as one engineer says , `` indeed a difficult thing for the engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he could UNK UNK skills STOP
START this difficulty UNK even though we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course STOP
START this leads one to conclude , as you have , that there is inevitably more prestige in a management position in the minds of our people '' STOP
START nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than engineering UNK and chief engineers STOP
START so we asked such men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on the `` UNK '' problem -- and more UNK -- their solutions STOP
START in the paragraphs that follow , we quote from UNK men who are identified on the final page STOP
START first : what title , what UNK ? ? STOP
START among the more familiar plans for UNK UNK is that of general electric STOP
START this is not a mutually exclusive plan ; ; STOP
START there is no one point in a man's career at which he must select either the technical or the UNK path upward STOP
START further , the management path does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by the more technical path STOP
START it is common to shift back and forth , working up through a number of UNK and UNK positions STOP
START actually , there are a number of UNK positions in both operating departments and in the UNK `` services '' operation that are filled by men with successful UNK experience who are currently UNK their capabilities STOP
START also , moving into a UNK position does not necessarily end a man's recognition as a technical expert STOP
START as examples at UNK : UNK UNK , formerly manager of the UNK division , widely recognized as a UNK designer STOP
START the late UNK , a pioneer in television design and UNK UNK & UNK of the electronics division , and later , by his own choice , an individual UNK STOP
START harold UNK , expert in UNK design , for a long period UNK & UNK of the measurements & industrial products division , and who currently , approaching retirement , is UNK and UNK engineer in the UNK & control division STOP
START in the UNK plan , a number of individual UNK have positions and compensation higher than those of many managers STOP
START these positions carry such UNK as : STOP
START UNK , advanced development STOP
START UNK engineer , STOP
START UNK engineer , heat transfer STOP
START UNK electrical engineer , STOP
START senior electrical engineer , STOP
START senior UNK STOP
START UNK has a similar system , with two UNK representing various levels of competence on the strictly technical side : UNK engineer or UNK , as the case may be , and advisory engineer or UNK STOP
START many companies have systems , particularly in r & d , which work more or less well , depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on the part of administration , as will be UNK apparent in subsequent UNK STOP
START another factor that may hold hope is for parallel recognition is , as one man says it : `` that the UNK for UNK top people along UNK lines is UNK to the UNK trained approach '' STOP
START senior staff engineer ? ? STOP
START one company UNK , early in 1959 , a vertical classification system consisting of four levels STOP
START there is no formal UNK to the UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START the top UNK level , senior staff engineer , UNK status and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision STOP
START the second level , senior engineer , rates slightly below UNK supervision STOP
START the UNK is that UNK UNK will be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third engineering level , with very few coming from the first level STOP
START the company UNK to extend upward both compensation and status for UNK engineers , but probably not into executive levels STOP
START in this organization , about half of the engineers with 15 or more years of employment are in supervision , engineering or elsewhere STOP
START this reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products -- which are not military STOP
START several other examples : central and UNK STOP
START `` we have over 20 divisions -- each of which has an engineering department headed by a chief engineer STOP
START we have set up a central r & d department , as well as UNK departments -- about UNK people working on problems related to those of our plants STOP
START a separate research department is , of course , confined to new or future designs STOP
START part of this headquarters staff , however , are engineering managers who work between UNK chief engineers and headquarters management STOP
START these headquarters engineers , headed by the UNK -- engineering , counsel and UNK UNK managers and chief engineers on product problems as well as aid with design ; ; STOP
START and many are engineers who have been advanced from the divisions STOP
START these men are considered managers of engineers STOP
START they must learn to wear several UNK , so to speak , working with management , sales and engineering problems related to the product STOP
START `` we do not have people in our organization UNK ' UNK ' or ' fellows ' , who are specialists in one particular technical subject STOP
START i suppose it is because we are just not big enough STOP
START we have a few ' UNK ' -- retired engineers retained and called in on certain problems STOP
START the only ' fellows ' in our company are those who have been UNK by UNK , UNK or UNK STOP
START i am sure that the engineer who enters management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities than he would have as a technical specialist -- because of his wider UNK '' STOP
START another structure STOP
START `` we have tried to make both UNK attractive , so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction in either STOP
START one way to UNK this is in the job structure STOP
START we have these positions , which compare directly : af STOP
START `` above these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and UNK of UNK , r & aj STOP
START the latter jobs include major management responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily through the UNK side STOP
START we have not yet succeeded in establishing recognition of technical UNK comparable to our higher levels of management , but i believe we will trend in this direction but not to exceed UNK '' STOP
START top job : research UNK STOP
START `` STOP
START approximately four years ago , we initiated a UNK UNK of UNK for technical persons STOP
START the highest position is known as a ' research UNK STOP
START this approach has not been entirely satisfactory STOP
START the primary UNK appears to lie with the technical people themselves , and their concept of what UNK status in present-day society STOP
START scientists who UNK UNK for technical recognition are often the most UNK to accept it STOP
START we have discovered that the UNK UNK such as private offices and private UNK are extremely important ; ; STOP
START and although we have attempted to provide these status symbols , support of the ' UNK ' plan has been UNK despite the creation of a salary potential for a research UNK UNK with that of men in top UNK positions STOP
START `` a serious problem accompanying the UNK approach is the difficulty of clearly UNK responsibilities and standards of performance for each level STOP
START with no set standards , there is the tendency to promote to the next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless of performance STOP
START promotion is too often based on UNK and time in salary grade instead of merit STOP
START if no specific organization plan exists UNK the number of scientists at each salary level , the result is a department UNK with UNK , UNK personnel '' STOP
START staff engineer UNK STOP
START `` we have two approaches for the technical man : the position of staff engineer , which is UNK as high in salary as department manager ; ; STOP
START and an administrative organization to take the routine load away from department managers and project engineers as much as possible , thus allowing them more time for strictly technical work STOP
START these are only UNK measures , and the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man in industry to progress without limit in salary and prestige '' STOP
START a complete plan STOP
START `` we have made limited application of the ' parallel UNK ' plan STOP
START the highest UNK UNK engineering title is ' research engineer STOP
START the salary schedule permits UNK greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering supervision ( engineering section head ) STOP
START we also have an ' engineering section head -- research engineer ' classification which has salary possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer STOP
START above this point there is no generally used parallel UNK STOP
START `` we also do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a ' professional ' and also to give public recognition to individual technical competence STOP
START these include UNK of , and assistance to , the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers STOP
START we have two UNK for UNK individual technical activity , a magazine widely distributed both within and without the company , and an information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes of all engineers STOP
START UNK is given to the award of patents to our engineers and financial support is provided for individual membership in technical societies STOP
START `` a recent , and more pertinent action , has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the UNK for engineering STOP
START this function is UNK by engineers chosen for their technical competence and who have the title , member of the technical staff STOP
START UNK compare favorably with those paid to the first two or three levels of management STOP
START additional symbols of status are granted , such as reserved parking , distinctive UNK passes UNK special UNK , and a difference in the treatment of financial progress through merit STOP
START `` we presently are involved in UNK a new development center STOP
START operations of this nature offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status STOP
START all scientific staff members will have the title , ' UNK member STOP
START the salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the scientific UNK acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific field STOP
START contrary to usual UNK UNK , the position to which UNK members report UNK will not necessarily UNK the duties of the UNK member , therefore , are not necessarily evaluated as highly STOP
START `` these recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence STOP
START it is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result entirely from company efforts STOP
START fundamental to the difficulty of creating the desired prestige is the fact that , in the business community , prestige and status are UNK in proportion to the authority that one man has over others and the extent of which he UNK in the management functions '' STOP
START UNK miles north of new york city where the UNK hills of UNK county meet the broad UNK of the hudson river there is a new home development called `` UNK heights '' STOP
START as a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every UNK county in the country with UNK ranch style UNK in the UNK range STOP
START but UNK heights is unique in one particular STOP
START its oil for heating is UNK monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point STOP
START this is a pilot operation sponsored by a new UNK UNK in delaware as the tri-state UNK corporation , with principal offices in new york state STOP
START its president is UNK UNK , partner in the law firm of UNK & waters , UNK UNK UNK new york city STOP
START UNK is UNK UNK and the UNK is mark UNK STOP
START UNK is the builder of UNK heights and president of UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK STOP
START the idea of a central UNK with lines to each house is not in itself a UNK STOP
START not a year goes by but what several local companies in the UNK canada , even overseas , write to UNK & oil heat to UNK if it's feasible and where it is being done STOP
START its editors only knew of one example to point to , a public housing development of UNK homes in new UNK described by john UNK in the march , 1950 issue STOP
START this has UNK the years but there has been considerable concern among the UNK over the fact that the oil was not UNK STOP
START rather the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons in the family STOP
START common UNK included `` UNK '' leaving her windows open all the time , a fresh air UNK , or the family was visiting `` UNK UNK '' with the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil STOP
START as a result of that attitude , others have been discouraged from trying central distribution STOP
START a new low capacity UNK is the key that UNK the situation at UNK heights STOP
START called a `` UNK '' UNK it was designed for this job by power plus industries of los angeles , a key individual being UNK UNK STOP
START tri-state has acquired its exclusive distribution for the northern , principal heating states STOP
START there's an advantage in having a firm like tri-state headed by a lawyer STOP
START the earlier new UNK development was public housing , so it easily UNK over the problems met in a private venture STOP
START these have to do with property rights , municipal official attitudes and a host of others STOP
START in working out the practical legal conclusions president waters was not thinking only of this pilot project , for it is planned to UNK this program or system in other builder developments UNK STOP
START it is always difficult , or at least UNK , to get approval of any kind of line under a public street , as one example STOP
START to overcome this , the builder UNK and UNK the street himself , then UNK it to the community while UNK a UNK UNK for the oil lines STOP
START when a family UNK a home the title is subject to a UNK UNK to tri-state STOP
START for the central storage , tri-state UNK one UNK , UNK its tanks and simply holds permanent title to that piece STOP
START in other words , the whole storage and UNK system does not belong to the UNK nor to the town but rather to tri-state STOP
START how does tri-state get its revenue from this plan ? ? STOP
START it UNK the whole UNK to a large oil company , at least large enough to have a strong credit position STOP
START this first test is being UNK for ten years but future projects will require at least 15 years STOP
START the amount paid by the oil company to tri-state for the use of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all the homes , is subject to UNK but naturally must be profitable to both parties STOP
START on this first venture the central storage is UNK UNK , in two tanks , or an average of 400 UNK for each of the 50 homes STOP
START the UNK UNK at his UNK in transport UNK , so as to maintain UNK weeks reserve supply against weather UNK STOP
START however , that is not all he has to do STOP
START he must UNK complete UNK of the UNK equipment to assure fine heating STOP
START in the present project the heating is by UNK hot water from UNK UNK units with UNK domestic hot water UNK STOP
START again , the oil man must read the meters at such intervals as he finds best STOP
START for this first development the UNK UNK the UNK is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being transferred for operation to its local UNK UNK STOP
START the major gets the assured UNK for the life of the UNK and the UNK apparently can do well because delivery cost is low STOP
START initial considerations STOP
START the officers of the new corporation have naturally UNK many UNK , as well as UNK that might be affected STOP
START for example , the officials of UNK town ( UNK ) where the project is located think highly of it because it UNK their snow UNK problem STOP
START the central storage is near a main artery quite easy to reach with large UNK on a short UNK UNK , with fewer UNK in the residential streets STOP
START the public service commission has ruled that this is not a public utility , subject to their many regulations STOP
START several financial institutions , both banks and insurance companies , have been UNK out STOP
START they like it and would supply most of the capital because of the long term UNK by strong oil companies STOP
START the government housing agencies consider it feasible with one special UNK STOP
START there must be a UNK in the UNK to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the current market price for the oil , an obvious UNK , since the account is UNK UNK , just like with gas or electricity STOP
START for a few details of the system the lines are UNK '' UNK , a product of republic steel UNK and all lines are UNK STOP
START they are laid a minimum of UNK '' deep and in some areas four feet down , particularly under roads , to stay clear of all other UNK such as water and UNK and to minimize UNK from heavy UNK STOP
START the UNK is mounted high on the basement wall STOP
START its figures are a half inch high and very easy to read , even into UNK UNK STOP
START it will UNK firing rates as low as a half UNK an hour STOP
START UNK , the builder , is convinced that the total cost of all the heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters STOP
START he believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder developments where gas is available STOP
START it would be pretty difficult to UNK a tri-state system in old neighborhoods , and that's an UNK STOP
START the job of getting property UNK and street UNK and the UNK for the tanks would become pretty UNK STOP
START but in a new development where everything starts from UNK the solutions are simple STOP
START future plans STOP
START what does tri-state actually want to do , now that it has the meters under UNK and certain phases of its UNK system in the `` patent applied for '' stage ? ? STOP
START it wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including its UNK in their new home projects , by financing and UNK the storage , UNK and meters , and UNK these for 15 years , with UNK UNK , to a strong oil company STOP
START it may also work in one other way -- by UNK its system patents and supplying the meters , letting the oil company or even the builder UNK the facilities STOP
START this whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers , for the idea has so often been mentioned , somewhat UNK STOP
START but it's too early yet to go visit UNK heights STOP
START only eight of the 50 houses were completed at the time of the UNK visit on june UNK ; ; STOP
START others were building STOP
START the big tanks were at the site but still UNK themselves STOP
START a big mechanical UNK was running the UNK , and the town building UNK was paying a friendly , if curious , visit STOP
START the UNK industry is looking up , led by a UNK of research and development STOP
START a primary UNK in these fields is imagination , and tri-state UNK corporation UNK a very good mark STOP
START every year about this time national UNK your cooling system week UNK around STOP
START it UNK in the long ( hot ) run to take good care of the water works STOP
START do it this way for the summer UNK : STOP
START first , drain that old UNK down the UNK UNK STOP
START don't save the UNK , even if it the expensive `` permanent '' type STOP
START the word means it won't UNK away easily , nothing else STOP
START the UNK UNK in the fluid are used up after one year , and you don't want to risk the UNK that two UNK use could mean STOP
START pitch it out STOP
START if a lot of UNK shows in the drain , use a good UNK UNK STOP
START then fill the system and add a UNK UNK STOP
START of course , you'll want to use the UNK water you can in your UNK STOP
START now , check for UNK in your UNK and UNK UNK , around the UNK UNK , UNK , water UNK UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START next , run the engine and let it heat up so the UNK UNK , and then look for UNK again STOP
START be sure the UNK and dirt are UNK out of the UNK UNK STOP
START use the air UNK for this job STOP
START check the temperature UNK and be sure it is working STOP
START if you use one of the new UNK cooling system fluids such as `` UNK '' be sure to check it STOP
START UNK says that the fluid can be used now for two years STOP
START check its UNK effectiveness before leaving it in during the summer STOP
START take UNK now , to be sure you avoid those UNK and UNK heat UNK when the temperature UNK this summer STOP
START don't let your mechanics pull the UNK out of those UNK delivery UNK or installation UNK of UNK STOP
START spring and summer may be here UNK , but those UNK stay in STOP
START the fact is that UNK and leaving out a UNK from any water cooled vehicle , will greatly increase the UNK consumption , reduce power and contribute to UNK plug UNK due to an UNK of excessive carbon UNK on the UNK STOP
START if you run into excess plug UNK on one UNK , check to be sure that the UNK has a UNK STOP
START the UNK is important to get your engine up to operating temperature quickly , and to keep it running at its most efficient temperature through the proper UNK of the UNK STOP
START are you paying too much for your UNK insurance ? ? STOP
START there's a good chance you are UNK on some coverage , not taking UNK coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut STOP
START have a talk with your insurance agent STOP
START be careful that you keep adequate coverage , but look for places to save money STOP
START first go over the type of coverage you now have STOP
START look for these features which may mean you can save : STOP
START UNK coverage STOP
START avoid UNK up on the same item STOP
START for example , don't pay in a UNK policy for medical coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy STOP
START does your policy have a UNK UNK ? ? STOP
START this means that if your UNK vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days , insurance can be suspended and a UNK return of your UNK made to you STOP
START this applies to UNK work of winter storage STOP
START the figure five is important in insurance STOP
START with many company policies you get a UNK discount if you insure five or more UNK STOP
START this means either cars or UNK STOP
START UNK run up to UNK of cost STOP
START usually UNK UNK can be obtained by applying UNK to your UNK plan STOP
START for example : if your UNK injury claims start payment after the first UNK , a UNK UNK saving is often made STOP
START in the period since the end of world war 2 , -- a period UNK with UNK demands for the colorful , the unusual , and the original in signs and displays -- plastics have come on so strong that today they are the UNK leaders in the field STOP
START the importance of the sign industry to the plastics industry , however , is not in terms of volume alone STOP
START designers of signs and displays have shown a UNK approach to the UNK of plastics that has influenced the UNK of other industries STOP
START many of today's developments in UNK stem from original work done with signs and displays ; ; STOP
START the art of UNK in UNK was similarly UNK by the sign makers ; ; STOP
START and the UNK UNK techniques now used for UNK , UNK , etc, UNK much to the field , as does the technology of UNK with the UNK properties of the UNK plastics STOP
START there is much that many industries can continue to learn from some of the more recent developments described below STOP
START the concept of UNK ( as shown by the UNK on UNK ) , as just one example , offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems -- no matter what industry is involved STOP
START a volume market STOP
START according to a recent wall street journal survey , plastics units now account for more than 50% of all sign sales STOP
START five years ago , they had only UNK of the market , with the remainder firmly UNK in the UNK of UNK UNK STOP
START and it's far from the end for plastics STOP
START industry sources are now UNK that UNK of the signs made during the UNK will be of plastic construction STOP
START evidence of this trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies in the field as advance UNK sign UNK los angeles , UNK STOP
START four years ago , the company's entire line was devoted to UNK signs ; ; STOP
START today , UNK is in plastics STOP
START from the volume UNK , the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive STOP
START UNK sales during 1960 reached approximately UNK million STOP
START currently , there are some UNK companies in the field , ranging from small firms with a UNK of employees to major concerns having complete facilities for production of metal , electrical , and plastic components STOP
START why the trend to plastics ? ? STOP
START what accounts for the rapid growth of plastics in the sign and display field ? ? STOP
START out of many factors which might be cited , five are most important : 1 STOP
START plastics combine such properties as UNK color , light weight , UNK UNK or UNK , resistance to UNK , as well as the ease of UNK STOP
START 2 STOP
START plastic signs are economical STOP
START according to one major UNK , materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately UNK less UNK than for a comparable UNK unit STOP
START shipping cost is also reduced ; ; STOP
START a UNK sign UNK about UNK UNK compared to UNK UNK UNK STOP
START the weight advantage , plus greater UNK of the plastic unit , UNK a saving of about UNK in shipping STOP
START the UNK weight also means less UNK UNK and UNK are needed STOP
START finally , maintenance costs on plastic signs are much lower than on UNK UNK signs STOP
START 3 STOP
START they offer exceptional design freedom , making it possible to UNK contours and details which give free range to the talents of the designer STOP
START UNK and UNK sheet plastics fill the gap between UNK and molded plastics STOP
START UNK , UNK UNK , and the freedom to form large and small , thick and thin materials make plastics UNK for the industry STOP
START 4 STOP
START plastic signs work around the UNK STOP
START internal UNK , protected from the elements , gives them powerful visual appeal at night ; ; STOP
START during UNK hours their brilliant colors command attention and interest STOP
START 5 STOP
START advances in equipment and UNK techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide choice of production techniques , ranging from UNK molding for UNK , UNK , UNK signs ( generally UNK units is the minimum ) to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited runs STOP
START among the UNK UNK methods to enter the display field are UNK UNK molding and UNK molding STOP
START what plastics to use ? ? STOP
START for outdoor signs and displays , acrylic , with its outstanding optical characteristics , weather resistance and UNK , strongly UNK the picture STOP
START at present , both the familiar cast acrylic and the newer UNK sheets are being used by sign manufacturers , with UNK now representing an estimated UNK of the total STOP
START ( see panel , UNK , for a comparison STOP
START ) STOP
START of interest is a recent UNK by du pont's UNK UNK a new UNK UNK UNK designated as UNK h 100 , which was developed specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and lighting industry STOP
START UNK cast from this material UNK UNK only one-third as much as glass , is UNK to all kinds of weather , and will not yellow STOP
START its high impact strength , even at low temperatures , UNK UNK , cracking , and UNK , according to du pont STOP
START UNK UNK UNK is used UNK for UNK signs , background panels , and molded or formed letters because of its exceptional UNK , ease of forming , and excellent UNK properties STOP
START its clarity and good optical properties are other important factors STOP
START new to the field is a UNK type UNK UNK in which the two sheets of the UNK are of different color STOP
START UNK the UNK and then UNK away the top layer is a quick and economical way to produce a UNK sign STOP
START ( see UNK , UNK , UNK ) STOP
START for specialized types of displays , such as large UNK units UNK a product , package , human or animal figures , etc, UNK plastics and UNK molded UNK UNK are other materials frequently used STOP
START a relative UNK in outdoor signs is UNK UNK film , now used as a printed UNK for UNK signs ( see below ) STOP
START for outdoor signs and displays , where the problem of UNK resistance is no longer a factor , the choice of plastics is almost unlimited STOP
START here may be found regular and impact UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK and UNK UNK , acrylic , UNK , UNK UNK foam , and UNK STOP
START the final choice of material depends upon such factors as costs , method of UNK , degree of UNK , number of units required , time available for UNK , and UNK life UNK of the unit STOP
START often , the finished sign or display UNK several types of plastics and two or more UNK techniques STOP
START UNK UNK STOP
START one of the most significant UNK in design of plastics signs is the so-called UNK UNK , now being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as advance UNK sign UNK los angeles , and industrial electric UNK new orleans , la STOP
START the essential difference between the new UNK boards and existing UNK is that the former , constructed of UNK plastic panels , are UNK from within STOP
START with the source of light behind the copy , there is no loss of UNK output , as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light STOP
START also , the light sources are UNK from dirt and weather exposure and cannot UNK the view of the sign STOP
START the copy itself , including any text or illustrations , is UNK in full color directly on a thin UNK UNK film by a UNK screen process STOP
START the film has an UNK on the back which permits it to be UNK onto the acrylic panels forming the sign , and also to be UNK off for replacement by new copy as required STOP
START spare sets of face panels UNK the change from one copy or message to another ; ; STOP
START new panels are UNK for the old right in the field on a single trip STOP
START panels with UNK copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied STOP
START signs of this type have already made their appearance in several larger cities , and others are on the way STOP
START it is believed that these boards will , within the next few years , replace many of the conventional UNK boards now in use STOP
START UNK signs also show UNK in other directions STOP
START as used by industrial electric UNK the film panels are printed one at a time , as are UNK UNK STOP
START thus the film can be applied to UNK UNK plastics faces ; ; STOP
START they can also be applied to UNK panels for use on UNK , or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin faces STOP
START in this way , the sign UNK has an economical means for UNK uniform copy on different sign UNK STOP
START recently industrial electric UNK another new development made possible by modern plastic materials -- a UNK spectacular sign STOP
START UNK of 16 UNK UNK plastic sections , it makes it possible to combine three different signs in a single unit STOP
START the UNK automatically UNK in a cycle which permits 9 UNK UNK time for each UNK subject STOP
START sixteen panels , each slightly more than UNK UNK , make up the UNK of the sign STOP
START UNK letters fill many needs STOP
START perhaps the best way to indicate the UNK of design that UNK the use of plastics in signs and displays would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this complex field -- UNK signs STOP
START signs are meant to UNK a message , and in most cases , this requires words and letters STOP
START frequently , the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products , price changes , etc STOP
START the huge market for UNK signs has UNK a universal demand for individual plastic letters , in all shapes and UNK -- and a number of companies are set up to supply them STOP
START here are some of the newer items currently available : STOP
START UNK products UNK chicago , UNK a UNK copy and display sign which consists of an UNK impact UNK background in choice of colors , onto which are mounted UNK letters , figures , or words UNK on UNK or other types of sheet stock STOP
START the background , which is available in various UNK and continuous lengths , is UNK with parallel UNK UNK which UNK the flexible letters UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK UNK , UNK letters molded of UNK , available in several UNK in either red or black STOP
START ideal for UNK use , they are UNK , and have UNK UNK on the back which fit into UNK in a UNK UNK background panel STOP
START for large letters , UNK of acrylic or UNK , there are other techniques STOP
START for example , in a typical store installation , fifty UNK six UNK acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background STOP
START the fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 UNK made it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic angle UNK UNK to the letters STOP
START UNK steel UNK were used to minimize UNK UNK STOP
START for UNK to UNK plastic UNK , very small holes may be UNK in the sides of the letters and UNK steel wire UNK through the UNK , its ends UNK behind the panels STOP
START large UNK letters are also available for sign installations STOP
START UNK sign service UNK chicago , for example , supplies them in several colors , in heights of 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 17 inches STOP
START they are molded of a special UNK formulation of UNK UNK STOP
START also available from this company are UNK UNK , UNK of UNK acrylic material , which may be UNK to any UNK acrylic background material STOP
START made in lengths from 3 to 10 UNK the bars are shaped in cross section to provide a secure fit for the UNK UNK molded in back of the letters STOP
START still another approach to the UNK letter type of sign is a UNK unit introduced by UNK products , UNK , UNK STOP
START this vacuum formed sign is UNK of UNK or smaller ) panels formed of UNK UNK sheet stock , UNK and UNK on the rear side STOP
START finished signs are produced by UNK the separate letter panels into channels of UNK , which may be mounted to various surfaces STOP
START the sheets are UNK of UNK UNK by jet UNK UNK los angeles , UNK STOP
START on UNK units , where additional structural requirements are imposed , one recent approach UNK UNK UNK or formed channels ( UNK UNK ) of the acrylic or UNK STOP
START joined side by side , such channels make possible construction of continuous UNK UNK areas up to 50 UNK and of unlimited width STOP
START letters may be UNK to the face of the combined channels , painted on the first surface , or handled in other ways STOP
START new rule UNK : : STOP
START don't build from the outside in -- try to build from the inside out STOP
START STOP
START don't insert your components into fixed UNK , they may or may not fit ; ; STOP
START position your components before you close them in STOP
START for example : STOP
START don't wall in your kitchen before you UNK the wall UNK and set the UNK STOP
START it's a lot UNK and easier to UNK the kitchen to fit the UNK and UNK the end wall after they are all in place STOP
START set your UNK before you close in the end of the UNK STOP
START don't try to UNK a UNK af through a narrow UNK STOP
START finish your UNK before you frame it in ( most economical UNK is a thin UNK UNK on either side of the UNK ) STOP
START finish UNK and UNK up your UNK and your water UNK before you wall them in STOP
START there is no better way to waste time than trying to UNK a UNK in a finished af UNK STOP
START don't position your UNK before you insert your windows in conventional construction ; ; STOP
START that way you may pay more to UNK the window into place than you paid for the window STOP
START you can save all that UNK time if you set your windows in one , two , three order -- first the UNK on one side , then the window , then the UNK on the other side STOP
START UNK your UNK UNK ( or UNK ) to the UNK and finish your UNK UNK before you UNK the ceiling STOP
START don't close in your house until everything has been carried in STOP
START last wall bob UNK UNK is the wall between the house and UNK STOP
START that way he can UNK his parts right UNK and UNK them under the roof STOP
START no auto UNK would dream of putting the head on the engine before he UNK the UNK in the block STOP
START and UNK makers , those most UNK and therefore most efficient of UNK , say they save hundreds of dollars by always building from the inside out STOP
START new rule UNK : UNK everything to get all the big savings the revolution in materials handling offers you STOP
START STOP
START this revolution is the UNK UNK news of all , because : 1 STOP
START it makes it easy to handle much UNK units , so you can plan to build with much bigger and UNK UNK components like those shown in the pictures UNK STOP
START 2 STOP
START it makes materials handling the only construction cost that ( like UNK and UNK ) should be lower today than in UNK STOP
START 3 STOP
START it changes the answers to `` who should do what , and where '' ? ? STOP
START it UNK the need for UNK UNK UNK and increases the chance for shop UNK , where almost everything can be made better and UNK STOP
START 4 STOP
START it changes the answers on when to do what at the site STOP
START for example , instead of putting in your UNK last ( as many builders do ) you can now save money by putting them in first STOP
START instead of UNK the house in first ( as most builders do ) you can now cut your costs by not UNK it in until you have to ( see p UNK ) STOP
START 5 STOP
START it changes the answers on UNK relations STOP
START not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs by `` buying direct '' and UNK the dealer STOP
START but now many of these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by UNK up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient specialized equipment to deliver everything just where it is needed -- UNK inside the house , UNK along the sides , UNK on the walls , UNK on the roof , etc STOP
START says UNK thompson : `` we dealers must earn our UNK by UNK a service for the builder UNK than he could do it himself '' STOP
START the revolution now under way in materials handling makes this much easier STOP
START the revolution is well under way , but much more remains to be done STOP
START STOP
START five years ago a house & home round table UNK by the lumber UNK research council reported UNK : STOP
START `` only one lumber dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit UNK ; ; STOP
START only one box car in eight has the wide UNK needed for unit UNK ; ; STOP
START only one UNK in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit UNK ; ; STOP
START only one builder in a thousand is equipped to receive unit UNK STOP
START `` so from raw materials to finished UNK the costs of materials handling ( most of it UNK ) add up to UNK of the total construction cost of housing '' STOP
START `` that house & home round table was the real starting point for today's revolution in materials handling '' , says UNK thompson , long chairman of the lumber UNK research council STOP
START `` it made our whole industry recognize the need for a new kind of UNK between manufacturer , UNK , equipment UNK , dealer , and builder , all working together to cut the cost of materials handling STOP
START before that we lumber dealers were working almost UNK on the problem '' STOP
START here is where things stand today : STOP
START 1 STOP
START almost all of the UNK lumber dealers who UNK primarily to the UNK market and supply UNK of this year's new houses are UNK STOP
START there are few areas left where a builder cannot find a dealer equipped to save him money by UNK everything at lower cost just where his UNK will need it STOP
START 2 STOP
START practically all UNK housing products can now be ordered in standard units UNK or UNK for mechanical handling -- including lumber , UNK UNK , glass block , face UNK , plaster , lime , UNK , UNK UNK and UNK , UNK , UNK UNK , floor tile , UNK tile , plaster base , and UNK UNK STOP
START 3 STOP
START UNK and UNK equipment makers now offer specialized units to meet almost every UNK need STOP
START for some significant new items see the pictures STOP
START 4 STOP
START more than 50% of all lumber is UNK ; ; STOP
START an UNK survey found that at least UNK lumber mills will UNK their shipments for UNK handling STOP
START of these , UNK said they make no extra charge for UNK in standard units , because they save enough on UNK UNK to UNK their UNK cost STOP
START most of the others will UNK their UNK to UNK charge rather than lose a good customer STOP
START `` with a UNK , dealers can UNK UNK lumber from UNK box cars for UNK compared with UNK or more to UNK loose lumber one piece at a time '' , says james wright of aj STOP
START 5 STOP
START lumber dealers and lumber manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for UNK shipments -- UNK '' wide by a UNK UNK '' high ( or six UNK UNK UNK '' wide by UNK UNK '' high ) STOP
START these units make it easy to load as much as UNK UNK ( say UNK lb in a UNK box car ) much more than the average for UNK cars STOP
START 6 STOP
START the UNK have responded by adding UNK more box cars with UNK UNK or wider for UNK UNK ( a UNK increase while the total number of box cars was falling UNK ) and by cutting their freight rates twice on lumber UNK in heavily loaded cars STOP
START first was a 1958 cut of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of UNK lb ; ; STOP
START later came a 1961 cut on the west coast ( still UNK elsewhere ) of UNK on UNK UNK UNK ( which works out to more than UNK on that portion of the load in excess of UNK lb STOP
START 7 STOP
START more UNK lumber is being UNK on flat cars , and UNK studies show that flat cars loaded with the new type UNK UNK method can be UNK for as little as UNK STOP
START for long UNK these shipments should be protected with UNK paper STOP
START this costs from UNK to UNK , but the cover can pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open STOP
START these UNK cut handling costs for the dealer -- and the builder STOP
START STOP
START says UNK james wright : `` since 1958 UNK that move material from the yard to the job site have UNK more radical changes than any of the UNK other equipment '' STOP
START the reason : today's components and lumber UNK are far too UNK to be handled by a UNK and a UNK STOP
START so manufacturers have UNK a new type of vehicle -- the UNK UNK STOP
START it cuts the lumber UNK cost because it takes only one man -- the UNK -- to UNK it , and because it UNK in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of hand UNK STOP
START and it helps the builder because it can handle a more UNK UNK load , can deliver it to the best spot ( in some cases , right on the roof or inside the house ) , and never takes any of the UNK UNK labor to help UNK it STOP
START says wright : `` our survey shows that one third of the retail dealers plan to increase the UNK of their materials handling in the coming two years STOP
START and most of the gain will be in UNK vehicles '' STOP
START new rule UNK : : STOP
START UNK what your men do , to help them waste less of the time you pay for STOP
START STOP
START half the UNK you pay for on most jobs are UNK because the job was not planned right , so the right tools were not UNK at the right place at the right time , or the right materials were not delivered to the UNK spots or materials were not UNK in the right order for UNK , or you bought UNK materials that took too long to fit , or your UNK had to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip STOP
START even `` america's most efficient builder '' , bob UNK of UNK , hopes to cut his labor costs another UNK per house as a result of the UNK studies now being completed on his operation by industrial efficiency engineers from the UNK works STOP
START already this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation UNK from UNK to UNK by UNK UNK time and UNK motion STOP
START builder UNK UNK of washington , past president of UNK , cut his UNK costs UNK a house by UNK the `` UNK UNK process '' worked out after careful UNK studies by the structural clay products research foundation to help UNK do better work for less STOP
START a UNK builder cut his labor costs per thousand UNK from UNK to UNK by UNK this same process , cut them another UNK to UNK by buying his UNK in convenient , UNK UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK process , with its precision UNK , its precision guide lines , its working level UNK , and its UNK UNK supply takes eight UNK to get set , but once ready it makes it easy for UNK to lay a thousand UNK a day STOP
START see page UNK STOP
START one good way to cut your labor waste is to make sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew STOP
START reports UNK UNK : `` by studying men on the job , we found that two men -- a UNK and a UNK -- can lay a floor UNK than three STOP
START we found that three men -- two UNK and a UNK -- can put up wall panels or UNK more UNK than four men -- because four men don't make two teams ; ; STOP
START they make one UNK UNK team STOP
START we found that wherever you can use two teams on a job , five men , not four , is the magic number '' STOP
START no house was ever built that could not have been built better for less if the work had been better planned and the work better scheduled STOP
START new rule UNK : : STOP
START don't waste any UNK time on green lumber to save UNK a UNK STOP
START STOP
START this is the most UNK , UNK UNK a builder can UNK STOP
START green lumber was all very well back in the days of wet plaster , when the UNK lumber was bound to UNK and then UNK as tons of water dried out the UNK STOP
START but now that all production builders build with UNK and all UNK builders build with panels , green lumber is an UNK you cannot afford STOP
START green UNK cost about UNK ; ; STOP
START dry UNK cost less than UNK more STOP
START so if a green UNK makes a UNK or a UNK UNK or anybody else waste even 20 UNK , the green UNK becomes more expensive than a dry UNK STOP
START there comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to be alone STOP
START not necessarily to be off all by ourselves , but away from the UNK and common UNK STOP
START if you've UNK in europe a time or two , it is quite certain that you've had that UNK feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the atlantic STOP
START following a guide , and UNK so , is an excellent way to see all the important places when everything is strange and new STOP
START however , after you've seen all the historical UNK and UNK , the places and UNK , the churches and UNK , the UNK and UNK , and begin to feel at home in the UNK of europe , you'll want to change your course and follow the UNK at will , far from the market places STOP
START the UNK at UNK , the traditional capital of the UNK country , has more UNK taste somehow than it has at a sidewalk UNK on the UNK de la UNK or at tour UNK STOP
START you can UNK history and follow , in UNK , the UNK in their quest for the holy UNK as they UNK out from UNK , an ancient town in the UNK of UNK UNK STOP
START and you don't meet the UNK from home in northwest UNK which has remained almost UNK by time and UNK since the middle ages STOP
START time stands still as you UNK the narrow , stone UNK in tiny villages UNK to UNK mountain UNK or UNK through UNK towns , UNK UNK UNK UNK , their faces turned to the sea STOP
START UNK been there since the days of the UNK and the UNK STOP
START and what better way to end a day than by dining with artists and UNK in a UNK but UNK UNK village on the UNK ? ? STOP
START an almost UNK way to set forth on such UNK is just to put yourself behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road STOP
START for those who need or want and can afford another car , buying one and driving it on the grand tour , then shipping it home , is one popular plan for a UNK UNK STOP
START then , of course , there are those of us who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car STOP
START the answer to this UNK is to pick up a telephone and UNK to rent one STOP
START it is that UNK STOP
START almost any travel agent will reserve a car for you STOP
START you can call one of the car rental services directly ( UNK , UNK , UNK UNK rental , and others ) and ask them to reserve a car of your choice , and some transportation lines offer this service as well STOP
START with few exceptions , your car will be waiting for you at UNK , UNK , railroad station or hotel when you arrive , UNK at no additional cost STOP
START you can wait , of course , until you arrive in europe before UNK your car STOP
START the UNK to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models readily available or you may have to wait a few days or , during the busy UNK season , when cars are in great demand , you might find it fairly difficult to get a car at all STOP
START since charges are relatively the same , UNK a car before you leave for europe will assure you of having one on tap when you want it STOP
START for those who plan to travel to europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave it in another city , or even another country , when you are ready to return home STOP
START at some cities , this UNK and delivery service is without additional charge , and , if you are UNK , when you are planning your UNK , you will take advantage of these free delivery and collection stations in major cities within the larger european countries STOP
START international UNK documents are usually provided with the car as are road maps and UNK data STOP
START a valid american driving license is accepted in all countries except UNK , UNK , UNK and eastern europe STOP
START if you plan to visit any of these countries , you can obtain your international driving permit before you leave at a UNK UNK -- around UNK STOP
START your insurance , too , with most agencies , is provided with the car , covering comprehensive fire , UNK , UNK and UNK with a UNK UNK which UNK in different countries STOP
START if you would feel UNK with full UNK insurance , there is a small additional charge , again varying from country to country and depending on the term of such insurance STOP
START the average charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly UNK a day STOP
START the charge is variable , however , and goes as low as UNK a day in UNK and as high as UNK a day in greece STOP
START rental fees are variable , too , throughout the countries of europe STOP
START there are as many rates as there are countries and models of cars available STOP
START as in the united states , there is a flat UNK rental charge plus a few cents per UNK driven , and the UNK rate drops if the car is retained for a week STOP
START it drops again after fifteen and UNK days STOP
START it is well to bear in mind that UNK will cost from UNK to UNK for the equivalent of a united states UNK and while you might prefer a familiar UNK , UNK or even a UNK , which are available in some countries , it is probably UNK to choose the smaller european makes which average thirty , UNK and even forty miles to the UNK STOP
START your choice of model will undoubtedly be governed by the number of people UNK in your group STOP
START with the exception of the sports cars , even the quite tiny UNK will seat four UNK if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and UNK space for really economical transportation STOP
START there is a large variety of models to choose from in most countries , however , including UNK UNK and station UNK and the rental UNK isn't all that much greater than for the UNK UNK STOP
START the basic costs are generally pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you reserve your car , but some of them offer UNK advantages STOP
START there is the free UNK `` rent it here , leave it there '' service , as an example , the free delivery and collection at the UNK , UNK or your hotel , UNK UNK , UNK documents and information and other similar services STOP
START a little investigation by telephone or reading the travel UNK in the newspapers and magazines will give you these pertinent details on the additional UNK benefits STOP
START the investigation will be well worth your time STOP
START all model cars are not available in all countries STOP
START quite naturally , there is a greater availability of those models which are UNK within a specific country STOP
START if you would like to start your tour in italy , where the rental fees are actually the UNK in europe , UNK in all UNK are available , as are UNK UNK UNK models STOP
START if you wish to budget closely on transportation , saving your extra dollars to UNK in UNK , one agency lists the small UNK UNK at only UNK a day plus UNK a UNK and the UNK UNK station wagon , UNK six , at just UNK a day and UNK a UNK STOP
START if you will be using your car more than fifteen days , which isn't all UNK , the daily rates drop quite sharply to UNK a day for the UNK UNK and to an UNK UNK a day for the UNK UNK station wagon STOP
START with six in the group , the cost comes to just a UNK a day per person on the daily UNK STOP
START in the majority of countries , however , the rates range from UNK to UNK a day for the smaller UNK and graduate up to UNK and UNK a day for the larger , luxury european models , with the rate per UNK driven starting at UNK and going up as high as UNK STOP
START the same model car might be available in six or eight countries , yet not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate or rate per UNK driven STOP
START the variations are not too great STOP
START rates for american cars are somewhat higher , ranging from about UNK a day up to UNK a day for a UNK UNK , but the rate per UNK driven is roughly the same as for the larger european models STOP
START rates in greece and UNK are fairly high , actually the highest in europe , and , surprisingly enough , they are also quite high in UNK STOP
START if you are planning to tour europe for longer than a month , it might be wise for you to UNK a car STOP
START the actual over-all cost , for the first month , will perhaps not be too much lower than the rental charges for the same period of time , but you will receive a new car STOP
START you will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner , which includes the factory UNK and the services valid at authorized dealers throughout europe STOP
START further , there is no mileage charge or mileage limitations when you UNK a car , and you pay only the flat monthly rate plus a UNK charge for documents and insurance since the car is registered and UNK individually for your trip STOP
START there is a fairly wide selection of models of english , german and french manufacture from which you can choose from the very small UNK 7 , UNK 2 UNK , UNK , UNK to the UNK UNK UNK STOP
START UNK a car is not as common or as popular as UNK a car in europe , but for long periods it will be UNK more economical and satisfactory STOP
START after the first month , rates are considerably less , UNK only about UNK a month for most UNK and UNK models STOP
START there are reasons for some people not UNK to rent cars and going on the UNK plan STOP
START for one thing , the UNK usually sees less and has less fun than his UNK since it becomes pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road STOP
START then , too , european UNK have UNK for being somewhat UNK on the road and some americans are not particularly UNK on getting mixed up with them STOP
START still there is a way for those who want to see some of the back country of europe by car STOP
START the way is to rent a UNK car STOP
START it isn't as expensive as most people believe it to be STOP
START your UNK expenses will average between UNK to UNK a day , but this charge is the same whether you rent a UNK UNK UNK or a UNK UNK or UNK UNK STOP
START the big spread is in the charge for each UNK driven , being governed by the rate at which UNK is UNK STOP
START since most european cars average more miles per UNK of UNK than american cars , it naturally follows that the cost per UNK for these models will be less , but the greater UNK capacity of the large american cars will UNK this , provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a UNK UNK STOP
START the fees for the rental of UNK cars vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for the UNK cars STOP
START however , whether you UNK to have a european or american model , if you rent a car with the proper UNK capacity in relation to the number of people in your party , your transportation expense will average very close to UNK per day per UNK STOP
START this will include your helpful , UNK UNK and a drive of an average of UNK UNK in any one day STOP
START if you drive greater distances than that , you'll just be UNK the surface and will never discover the UNK , UNK and beauty which UNK you in the first place to UNK the UNK STOP
START of course , if you want to throw all caution to the UNK and rent an UNK or UNK UNK just for you and your UNK , you'll have a UNK tour , but it won't be UNK , and it is not recommended unless you own a producing oil well or you've had a UNK in the irish UNK STOP
START in american UNK , almost nothing rates higher than what the movie men have called `` meeting UNK '' -- that is , UNK seems more UNK if it doesn't take place in an atmosphere of correct and UNK UNK STOP
START just about the most UNK UNK example of meeting UNK is the charles UNK UNK UNK : UNK all he did was give her a UNK of UNK , but he said simultaneously , `` i wish they were UNK '' STOP
START aside from the UNK content here , a good UNK could readily pick up a few other facts , especially if he had a little more of the conversation to go on STOP
START the way UNK said his line -- if you had the recorded UNK of a professional UNK -- would probably have gone like this : af primary stresses on UNK and wish ; ; STOP
START note pitch 3 ( pretty high ) on UNK but with a slight degree of UNK , one degree of UNK STOP
START conclusions : the people involved ( and subsequent facts bear me out here ) knew clearly the relative values of UNK and UNK , both UNK and UNK STOP
START and the UNK , UNK voice of UNK , though fairly UNK , was still well within the prescribed UNK of their culture STOP
START in other words , like UNK machines designed to work in UNK , they shared the same UNK , a mutual understanding not only of english words , but of the four stresses , UNK , and UNK that can change their meaning from black to white STOP
START at this point , unfortunately , UNK becomes a UNK small part of the picture ; ; STOP
START but consider , if you can bear it , what might have happened if UNK , for some UNK , UNK reason , had made the same remark to an UNK girl in UNK STOP
START to her UNK and UNK would have been just so much UNK STOP
START the point -- quite simply -- is this : words they might have had ; ; STOP
START but communication , no STOP
START this basic principle , the first in a UNK UNK UNK , was UNK to me by UNK lee smith , jr, at the university of UNK , where he heads the world's first department of UNK and UNK STOP
START a UNK , UNK man , apparently constructed on an UNK system of UNK UNK to the same UNK rhythm as his mind , smith began his academic career teaching speech to UNK girls -- a project considerably UNK by his devotion to a recording about `` a young UNK named arthur , who never could make up his mind '' STOP
START later , he became one of the central spirits of the army language program and the language school of UNK foreign service institute STOP
START it was there , in the course of trying to prepare new men for the `` culture shock '' they might encounter in remote overseas posts , that he first began to develop a system of UNK the `` norms of human communication '' STOP
START to the trained ear of the UNK , talk has always revealed a UNK quantity of information about the UNK -- such things as geographical origin and history , UNK identity , education STOP
START it is only fairly recently , however , that UNK have developed a systematic way of UNK UNK on paper in a way that tells even more about the UNK and about the success or failure of human communication between two people STOP
START this , for obvious reasons , makes their techniques UNK useful in studying the UNK interview , so useful , in fact , that they have been successfully used to suggest ways to speed UNK and to evaluate the progress of therapy STOP
START in the early UNK , smith , together with his distinguished UNK , george UNK ( so UNK academic he sometimes UNK his own evident UNK ) , and a third man with the UNK name of UNK ( UNK ) , agreed on some basic UNK about the UNK process that makes communication : ( 1 ) words or language ( 2 ) UNK , a set of phenomena including UNK , UNK , voice UNK , and `` tone '' of voice , and ( 3 ) UNK , the technical name for UNK , UNK expressions , and body shifts -- UNK or UNK the head , `` talking '' with one's hands , et UNK STOP
START UNK first UNK with stresses , UNK , and UNK was based on mother , which UNK , in our culture , a good deal more than bread alone STOP
START for example , if you are a reasonably UNK person , there are certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for UNK your mother STOP
START the usual UNK would be : af middle UNK , slight UNK ( UNK ) before mother , slight rise at the end STOP
START the symbols of mother's status , here , are all usual for culture UNK STOP
START quite other feelings are evidenced by this style : af note the drop to pitch 1 ( the UNK ) on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence ; ; STOP
START this is a `` UNK '' ending , and what you have here is a UNK style of speech , expressing something less than conventional respect for mother STOP
START even less regard for UNK and UNK UNK pie goes with : af in other words , the way the speaker UNK to mother is clearly indicated STOP
START and while the meaning of the words is not in this instance altered , the quality of communication in both the second and third examples is UNK UNK STOP
START an accompanying record of UNK factors for the second example might also note a UNK UNK STOP
START with this UNK sentence -- though the speaker undoubtedly thought he was dealing only with the subject of food -- he was telling things about himself and , in the last two examples , UNK that he had UNK from the customs of his culture STOP
START the joint investigations of UNK and UNK have established , in point of fact , that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words are involved , it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling over and over again what sort of people they are and how they UNK to the rest of the world STOP
START since UNK is the basic therapeutic and UNK instrument of modern UNK , the recording of interviews for UNK and study has been a UNK of UNK proportions in new research and training STOP
START some of the earliest UNK , made in the UNK demonstrated that UNK UNK immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track , whereas written records of the same interview offered far fewer UNK to therapy which -- if they were at all UNK in UNK -- were picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts STOP
START in a general way , UNK were able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt -- that the most telling UNK in UNK are UNK , that such things as stress and UNK are UNK by sound alone and not necessarily by words STOP
START at a minimum , recording -- usually on tape , which is now in wide professional use -- brings the UNK interview alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be UNK repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of UNK STOP
START UNK to this UNK battery are the experts in UNK who have carried that minimum to a new level STOP
START by adding a systematic analysis with symbols to the UNK UNK of interviews , they have supplied a new set of techniques for the therapist STOP
START UNK UNK of the UNK interview UNK points where the patient's voice UNK from expected norms STOP
START it UNK such possible UNK of communication as UNK UNK , the note of disapproval , UNK or UNK , UNK , UNK , and the UNK to speak at all -- this last often marked by a UNK beginning of UNK STOP
START interpretation , naturally , remains the role of the therapist , but orientation -- not only the patient's UNK UNK of geographical and UNK background , but also UNK but UNK UNK of danger spots in his relationship to people -- can be considerably UNK up by the UNK STOP
START his UNK UNK of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper UNK may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties , making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient STOP
START in one UNK first interview , for example , the UNK ( UNK from the book , the first five minutes ) goes like this : the UNK level tone is UNK and neutral -- he has , for example , avoided UNK `` you '' , which would UNK disapproval ; ; STOP
START or surprise , which would set the patient apart from other people STOP
START the patient , on the other hand , is far from neutral ; ; STOP
START aside from her specifically regional UNK , she reveals by the use of the UNK , `` UNK , UNK , UNK '' , a certain UNK UNK that indicates she has some UNK with literary or scientific language ( i.e, she must have had at least a UNK education ) , and she is telling a story she has UNK UNK some time before STOP
START then she UNK into `` everything and everybody '' , putting particular violence on `` everybody '' , UNK to the UNK that this is a spot to UNK -- that is , it is not UNK to the patient's general style of speech up to this point STOP
START consequently , it is referred to the therapist for attention STOP
START he may then very well conclude that `` everybody '' is probably not the true target of her UNK STOP
START immediately thereafter , the patient UNK her UNK story , UNK into an UNK , UNK , UNK UNK , `` i don't feel like talking right now '' STOP
START within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent to the therapist that `` everybody '' UNK refers to the UNK husband STOP
START she says later , but still within the opening five minutes , `` i keep thinking of a divorce but that's another emotional death '' STOP
START the UNK and UNK signals of misery are all present in the voice chart for this sentence ; ; STOP
START so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce STOP
START by saying `` another emotional death '' , she reveals that there has been a previous one , although she has not described it in words STOP
START this the therapist may pursue in later UNK STOP
START the phrase , `` emotional death '' , interesting and , to a UNK mind , rather UNK , suggests that this woman may have some UNK for words , perhaps even something of the UNK UNK called `` creative '' STOP
START since the UNK interview , like any other interview , depends on communication , it is significant to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience STOP
START his own communication apparatus operated UNK , and UNK UNK readers will note UNK its total lack of UNK to the UNK , UNK UNK mechanism of UNK STOP
START UNK enough -- although none of the UNK UNK involved could UNK compare with UNK -- when groups of them began playing back interviews , they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to UNK their own interview techniques ; ; STOP
START almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape , expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again STOP
START yet , in spite of this , intensive study of the UNK interviews by teams of UNK and UNK laid UNK the surprising fact that , in the first five minutes of an initial interview , the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just UNK wrong with him ; ; STOP
START to spot these UNK the therapist must know either UNK or UNK how to listen STOP
START naturally , the patient does not say , `` i hate my father '' , or `` UNK UNK is what UNK me '' STOP
START what he does do is give himself away by UNK information over and above the words involved STOP
START some of the classic UNK , as described by UNK , UNK , and UNK in the first five minutes , are these : UNK of UNK : STOP
START UNK or UNK of i , you , he , she , et UNK may signal UNK or uncertainty STOP
START on the other hand significant facts may be UNK -- she may mean i or everybody , as it did with the UNK and UNK woman mentioned before , may refer to a specific person STOP
START the word that is not used can be as important as the word that is used ; ; STOP
START therapist and UNK must always consider the alternatives STOP
START when someone says , for example , `` they took UNK to see that there was nothing wrong with me '' , it UNK to consider how this statement would normally be made STOP
START ( this patient , in UNK , was a UNK who had almost come to the point of accepting the fact that it was not her UNK but her UNK that was the cause of her difficulty STOP
START ) amateur UNK note here that UNK , in UNK UNK UNK , UNK when he spoke of his wife , which is hardly surprising in view of their UNK relationship STOP
START she was just another UNK from the states , and she seemed as commonplace as her name STOP
START she was the john UNK , one of those atlantic UNK that had UNK to bari to bring UNK , bombs , and bullets to the UNK air force , to field UNK UNK eighth army then UNK up the UNK of the UNK of italy in that early december of 1943 STOP
START the john UNK arrived in bari , a port on the UNK , on november UNK , making for UNK UNK , which , as the name indicates , was the ancient UNK new and modern harbor STOP
START hardly anyone UNK marked her as she UNK UNK off UNK 29 on the UNK STOP
START if anyone thought of the john UNK , it was to observe that she was UNK by a pair of ships heavily UNK with high UNK and if they were hit the john UNK would likely be UNK up with her own UNK and whatever else it was that she carried STOP
START which was UNK gas STOP
START it had required the approval of president franklin UNK roosevelt before the john UNK could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and UNK to the italian UNK STOP
START for in a world as yet UNK with the UNK of the UNK cloud , UNK gas was still regarded as the ultimate in UNK weapons STOP
START throughout the early years of world war 2 , , reports UNK that the axis powers had used gas -- germany in russia , japan in china again STOP
START they were always denied STOP
START influential people in america were warning the UNK to be prepared against UNK gas UNK by the germans in future campaigns STOP
START some UNK went so far as to urge our using it first STOP
START to silence UNK , to UNK the axis , president roosevelt issued this statement for the allies in august : STOP
START `` from time to time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the axis powers were seriously UNK use of UNK gas or UNK UNK or other UNK devices of warfare STOP
START i have been UNK to believe that any nation , even our present enemies , could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and UNK weapons STOP
START `` however , evidence that the axis powers are making significant preparations UNK of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources STOP
START `` use of such weapons has been UNK by the general opinion of UNK mankind STOP
START this country has not used them , and i hope that we never will be compelled to use them STOP
START i state UNK that we shall under no circumstances UNK to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies '' STOP
START the following month the UNK of italy was begun , and roosevelt gave effect to his warning by UNK to the UNK of UNK gas in southern italy STOP
START bari was chosen as a depot , not only for its UNK safety , but because of its UNK to UNK STOP
START any UNK gas attack would be UNK STOP
START it would be made in three waves -- the first to lay down a UNK , the second to drop the gas bombs , the third to UNK UNK which would UNK everything below STOP
START so the UNK UNK went into the hole of the john UNK STOP
START a UNK of six men from the UNK chemical maintenance company under first UNK UNK went aboard , followed by UNK UNK , the UNK security officer STOP
START UNK was UNK STOP
START only a few other people -- very important people -- knew of the UNK eggs UNK below UNK STOP
START no one else must know STOP
START thus , in the UNK way -- in the way of the right hand that knows and the left that does not -- was the stage set for tragedy at bari STOP
START it was the night of december 2 , 1943 , and it was growing dark in bari STOP
START it was getting on toward 7 o'clock and the german UNK plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit STOP
START UNK of the office of harbor defense was very UNK STOP
START he knew that german long-range bombers had been returning to the attack in italy STOP
START on november UNK , they had made a UNK on la UNK STOP
START two days later , some 30 of them had struck at a UNK off UNK , UNK a UNK -- and it had been that very night that the UNK had made its first appearance STOP
START after it had UNK the next two nights , UNK went to higher headquarters and said : STOP
START `` for three days now a german UNK plane has been over the city taking pictures STOP
START they're just waiting for the proper time to come over here and UNK this place into the UNK '' STOP
START but the older and UNK heads had UNK his warning as UNK STOP
START even though it was known that the UNK in the north was now being directed by the young and UNK general UNK , the commander who would conduct the `` little UNK '' on london in UNK , a major UNK on bari at this UNK of the war was not to be considered seriously STOP
START true , there had been UNK on UNK -- but UNK was pretty far north on the opposite coast STOP
START no , bari was out of range STOP
START more than that , UNK air had complete UNK in the eighth UNK sector STOP
START so captain UNK returned to his harbor post to watch the UNK plane put in five more UNK , and to feel the certainty of this UNK rising within him STOP
START for UNK knew that UNK UNK were made of paper STOP
START the royal air force had but a single light UNK UNK and two UNK units available STOP
START there were no UNK UNK on bari UNK STOP
START the radar station with the best location was still not UNK STOP
START telephone communication was bad STOP
START and everywhere in evidence among the few remaining UNK units was that old UNK of disaster -- multiple command STOP
START it had been made UNK evident that very morning to UNK UNK UNK , in charge of the armed guard aboard the john UNK STOP
START a british officer had come aboard and told him that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs were actually dropped STOP
START then he was to UNK his fire with a UNK shore gun firing white UNK STOP
START `` this harbor is a UNK UNK '' , the UNK had said with frank UNK STOP
START `` it's up to you to protect UNK STOP
START we can't expect any help from the UNK at UNK , either STOP
START they're all being used on UNK missions '' STOP
START UNK had been UNK STOP
START not fire until the bombs came down ! ! STOP
START he thought of the tons and tons of UNK fluid beneath his feet and UNK his head STOP
START like hell ! ! STOP
START like hell UNK wait -- and UNK the UNK gun got knocked out ? ? STOP
START what would his guns guide on then -- the north UNK ? ? STOP
START UNK UNK decided that he would not UNK until he heard the UNK of the bombs , and when night began to fall , he put UNK 2 UNK UNK and UNK 1 william UNK on the guns and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy UNK STOP
START below UNK , UNK 1 UNK UNK had begun to write a letter home STOP
START above UNK on the john UNK , lieutenant UNK UNK at the lights still burning on the port wall and felt uneasy STOP
START there were lights UNK in the city , too , even though it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible STOP
START bari was asking for it , he thought STOP
START for five days now , they had been in port and that UNK UNK was still in the hold STOP
START UNK UNK when it would be UNK STOP
START he hoped they would put in UNK way , way down in the earth STOP
START the burden of his secret was pressing down on him , as it was on lieutenant UNK and his six UNK men STOP
START lieutenant UNK could UNK the officers and men of the john UNK in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing more dangerous than high UNK bombs STOP
START they seemed happy at the delay in UNK , UNK at the chance to go UNK in a UNK liberty port such as bari STOP
START nine of them had gone down the UNK already STOP
START UNK UNK james UNK and UNK walter UNK had been the first to leave STOP
START UNK had returned their UNK UNK with the UNK UNK that is the security officer's stock in trade STOP
START the other half of the crew , plus UNK and his men , had remained aboard STOP
START UNK UNK to sea and started slightly STOP
START UNK if that wasn't a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor -- UNK UNK STOP
START the night was so clear that UNK had no difficulty making out the UNK STOP
START then the thought of a UNK sky made him UNK , and he UNK upward STOP
START his eyes UNK STOP
START it was a clear night and it was UNK ! ! STOP
START UNK UNK , military governor of the UNK UNK , had also seen and felt the `` rain '' STOP
START but he had UNK it for UNK STOP
START captain UNK UNK UNK with the UNK name UNK had just left UNK UNK with a UNK of UNK UNK oil for the UNK civilian population STOP
START UNK was on UNK STOP
START at exactly UNK , he felt a UNK object brush his face STOP
START he UNK at it UNK STOP
START he turned the beam of his UNK on it STOP
START he UNK STOP
START it was the silver foil from the UNK bar he had been UNK STOP
START he UNK STOP
START but how could -- ? ? STOP
START another , longer strip of UNK UNK his mouth STOP
START it was two feet long STOP
START it was not UNK UNK STOP
START it was `` window '' -- the UNK paper dropped by bombers to UNK radar sets , to fill the scope with hundreds of UNK that would seem to be approaching bombers STOP
START `` UNK '' ! ! STOP
START UNK UNK to his italian UNK STOP
START `` stop ! ! STOP
START stop the engines '' ! ! STOP
START UNK UNK and stopped , hundreds of brilliant white UNK UNK UNK down from the black , the air UNK UNK UNK rose in a UNK UNK , the UNK guns UNK and UNK -- and above it all motors UNK and the bombs came UNK and UNK and UNK down among the ships at UNK at bari STOP
START they had come from UNK in the UNK , these UNK UNK UNK STOP
START they had UNK over the UNK , they had taken bari by complete surprise and now they were UNK her , UNK with deadly skill STOP

START occasionally there are examples of UNK which cannot be pushed aside without UNK an UNK attitude STOP
START one day UNK , coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detailed the UNK UNK in advance so accurately that his UNK was completely UNK STOP
START UNK UNK UNK for the `` UNK '' of UNK research was altered somewhat when he UNK `` how , or why , had i been shown an UNK roll of my life film '' ? ? STOP
START the famous author tells us of the strange incident in something about myself STOP
START one day when he attended a war UNK UNK in westminster UNK his view was UNK by a UNK man on his left , his attention turned to the UNK pattern of the rough UNK UNK and someone , UNK him by the arm , UNK , `` i want a word with you , please '' STOP
START at that moment UNK was UNK with UNK UNK , suddenly UNK that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier STOP
START UNK probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , UNK us to recognize their UNK in our UNK thoughts STOP
START however , readers who accept UNK findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should UNK over the following words in his interpretation of dreams , chapter 1 : : STOP
START as `` a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case , , and what is more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the UNK or UNK power of dreams '' STOP
START dreams present many UNK of UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK STOP
START the basic mystery of dreams , which UNK all the others and UNK us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual UNK STOP
START i recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which i lived through the UNK of the UNK of a little UNK town STOP
START i am sure that nothing within me is capable of UNK that UNK sequence , so complete in detail , from the UNK of news pictures i have seen STOP
START and when psychology explains UNK , `` but the UNK mind is able to produce it '' it refers to a mental region so UNK identified that it may UNK the entire universal mind as UNK as part of the individual mind STOP
START UNK may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is UNK UNK of routine evidence STOP
START the question becomes , `` what is a dream '' ? ? STOP
START is a dream simply a mental or UNK movie ? ? STOP
START every dream , and this is true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of UNK thought , is a UNK phenomenon for which no explanation is available STOP
START in most cases we recognize certain words , persons , animals or objects STOP
START but these are UNK in original action , in some particular continuity which we don't remember having seen in real life STOP
START for instance , the UNK sees himself UNK behind UNK smith and , with photographic realism , sees smith driving the car ; ; STOP
START whereas , it is a matter of fact that smith cannot drive a car STOP
START there is nothing to suggest that the brain can UNK past impressions to fit into an original , realistic and UNK continuity like we experience in dreams STOP
START the entire concept of UNK UNK as the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support STOP
START a `` mental image '' UNK UNK us from beneath its language symbols in UNK thought , or UNK in light sleep , is actually not an image at all but is UNK of realities , viewed not in the UNK UNK stream , but within the depths of the fourth UNK STOP
START dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory UNK their basic mystery and all its components , including that UNK feeling of UNK UNK , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem STOP
START as in the theory of perception , established in UNK , the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain STOP
START but then this theory UNK that it is completely at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain STOP
START the opening UNK of the chapter UNK the theory of representative perception , in the book UNK of science by albert UNK says , `` passed on to the brain , and there , by some UNK process , it causes the mind to have a perception '' STOP
START but why is it necessary to UNK the UNK image within the brain ? ? STOP
START as UNK images are UNK to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the UNK , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers -- rather than to UNK on the transmission of an image which is already in required location STOP
START UNK , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the UNK image , the purpose of which would be to achieve UNK cooperation by UNK sympathetic UNK in the other UNK centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness STOP
START modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists of minute waves of energy STOP
START we know that the number of radio and television UNK , sound waves , UNK UNK , etc, that may occupy the very same space , each UNK upon its own frequency , is infinite STOP
START so we may conceive the UNK of the infinite number of universal , apparently UNK states of matter , UNK one after another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies STOP
START this theory makes it possible for any event throughout UNK to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness STOP
START space in any form is completely measured by the three dimensions STOP
START if the fourth UNK is a physical concept and not purely metaphysical , through what medium does it extend ? ? STOP
START it is not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent UNK past , or the UNK UNK future STOP
START three UNK flat is the usual time , and the space is crossed by moderate mileage , while the overwhelming UNK of such UNK must be conceived as a UNK UNK through an enormous number of UNK frequencies which UNK all events STOP
START the body , UNK and brain , in common with all matter , have their UNK on each of a UNK number of frequencies STOP
START the UNK in each UNK bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency , whereas those upon all other frequencies are UNK , UNK and UNK to them STOP
START consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to UNK impressions STOP
START when consciousness UNK the sleeping body and the UNK world , it continues in the UNK UNK of the UNK past and future , in a life as UNK and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep STOP
START if the UNK realistic continuity of dreams , however UNK their combinations , UNK that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be UNK from views of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life STOP
START UNK , professor of UNK at the university of pennsylvania , UNK that a UNK priest , associated with the king UNK , ( UNK UNK UNK him to the UNK chamber of the temple of UNK , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken UNK , and UNK an error in its identification STOP
START as a matter of fact , the UNK classification , the result of many weeks of labor by UNK , was about to be published by him the following day STOP
START some time later the UNK part of the UNK was found and the complete UNK , together with other new evidence , fully UNK the ancient UNK information STOP
START UNK was UNK as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream STOP
START he was almost positive it was not UNK nor UNK , and UNK it must have been german or english STOP
START we may conclude that all six points of information , UNK given by the dream priest , could have been furnished by UNK UNK UNK STOP
START but , in UNK any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly UNK that realistic , UNK visual continuity UNK by UNK UNK , violent break or sudden UNK ? ? STOP
START which theory is more fantastic : 1 STOP
START that the perfect continuity was composed from the UNK of memory impressions in the UNK brain , or 2 STOP
START that the dream was a reality on the infinite UNK of universal , gradient frequencies , across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient UNK met ? ? STOP
START the degree of circumstance , the ratio of memory to UNK , determines whether a dream will be a recognized , UNK UNK , or the UNK , effective source of the UNK UNK UNK feeling STOP
START no doubt some experiences UNK so completely as to leave no trace on the UNK mind STOP
START probably less than one percent of our UNK escape final UNK before we UNK STOP
START when we arrive at the events concerned in the UNK majority , they , of course , cannot UNK us as anything familiar STOP
START nevertheless , there are notably frequent instances of UNK UNK , in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before , a feeling which , though vague , UNK the verbal UNK from the most impressive corps of psychologists STOP
START if UNK UNK is an illusion , then UNK , it is a most UNK mental UNK UNK even the most UNK people STOP
START UNK UNK , UNK UNK for the republican presidential UNK , was attending a convention at UNK , where he was scheduled to UNK colonel UNK roosevelt for governor of new york when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met STOP
START after the preliminary business affair was finished UNK UNK and delivered the UNK speech that UNK the UNK for roosevelt STOP
START if UNK had told any academic UNK that he had a UNK feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past , he would have been informed that he was a victim of UNK UNK STOP
START but the famous UNK felt more than vague recognition for the scene STOP
START he remembered exactly when he had lived through it before , and he had something to prove he had STOP
START one week before the convention , UNK was UNK on the UNK of a country home on the hudson , UNK at the opposite shore STOP

START so wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from north country school , lake UNK , new york STOP

START because the food is selected with thought for its UNK value , care for its origin , and prepared in a manner that UNK the most UNK , the food does taste good STOP

START as UNK began to show through the UNK windows , fogg would place a call to william UNK at the UNK station at UNK , vermont , for temperature and UNK readings STOP
START UNK could also give the UNK a pretty good idea of area UNK by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station STOP
START `` UNK '' were judged by comparison with known mountain heights and cloud positions STOP
START later on in the day fogg could get a better weather picture from the UNK weather bureau UNK by frank UNK STOP

START ( UNK get the engine oil flowing with an electric UNK under a big UNK cover STOP
START ) UNK to show that UNK was UNK and here to stay , bob fogg always made a point of taking off each morning on the UNK of seven , UNK rain , snow and UNK in true UNK tradition STOP

START often , UNK through the UNK , he was forced to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling , UNK above the UNK or the white river along the line of the broken railroad STOP
START when driving rain or UNK UNK in one valley , fogg would UNK up and over to reverse course and try another one , ranging from the UNK up to UNK in search of safe passage through the mountain passes STOP
START the UNK wright engine was never stopped on these trips STOP
START it UNK over UNK , UNK while fogg UNK UNK with the armed UNK from UNK at fort UNK UNK , and one from UNK and UNK at the stjohn field STOP
START sometimes , on a return trip , the UNK would `` go UNK '' high over the clouds STOP
START there UNK take a compass reading , figure his air speed , and UNK that in a certain number of minutes UNK be over the broad UNK of the UNK valley where it would be safe to let down through the UNK and see the ground before it hit him STOP

START day after day fogg UNK back and forth on his UNK air mail route , until the farmers in their UNK UNK and the road UNK came to recognize the UNK plane as their UNK with the rest of the country STOP

START you realize you are getting in the old UNK class STOP
START to put it UNK , you are getting UNK STOP
START UNK happened ? ? STOP
START the answer is a new era STOP
START now , UNK on the horizon are such things as estimated UNK , calculated UNK and UNK STOP
START the planning UNK into existence STOP
START all UNK of plans come to life STOP
START this is followed by a UNK in conferences STOP
START yes sir ! ! STOP
START conferences become very popular STOP
START when a plan burst its UNK , UNK conferences supply the necessary UNK , and life goes UNK on STOP

START some have plenty of money -- some have very little money STOP
START some are UNK with an UNK of good health -- some are in poor health and many are UNK STOP
START some have lovely homes -- some live in small UNK STOP
START some have beautiful gardens -- some not even a UNK of grass STOP
START some have UNK of mind , the ability to accept what they have , and make the most of it ( a wonderful gift to have , believe me ) -- some see only darkness , the bitter side of everything STOP
START well , whatever you have , that's it ! ! STOP
START you've got to learn to live with it STOP
START now ! ! STOP
START the question is `` how are you going to live with it '' ? ? STOP
START you can sit back and UNK and UNK your lot STOP
START yes ! ! STOP
START you can do this STOP
START but , if you do , your life will be just one thing -- UNK -- complete and UNK STOP
START it seems to me , the first thing you've got to do , to be happy , is to face up to your problems , no matter what they may be STOP
START make up your mind to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years of life STOP
START one thing , i am sure of , you must get an interest in life STOP
START you've got to do something STOP
START many of you will say , `` well , what can i do '' ? ? STOP
START believe me ! ! STOP
START there are many , many things to do STOP
START find out what you like to do most and really give it a UNK STOP
START if you can't think of a thing to do , try something -- anything STOP
START maybe you will surprise yourself STOP
START true ! ! STOP
START we are not all great artists STOP
START i , UNK , can't draw a straight line STOP
START maybe you are not that UNK either , but how about UNK around with the old UNK ? ? STOP
START you may UNK yourself and acquire a real UNK for it STOP
START UNK , i'll UNK you have a lot of fun STOP
START do you like to UNK ? ? STOP
START does making your own clothes or even UNK clothes , interest you ? ? STOP
START do you love to run up a UNK , UNK on UNK , make UNK UNK ? ? STOP
START if you do , go to it STOP
START there is always a market for this line of work STOP
START some women can sit and UNK , UNK , UNK or UNK by the hour , and look calm and UNK and turn out beautiful work STOP
START where UNK is concerned , i'm a total loss STOP
START when you see a UNK in my hands you will know the family UNK have fallen off and i have to UNK them back on , or get out the safety UNK STOP
START then again , there's always that lovely old UNK of UNK or UNK UNK STOP
START not for me , but perhaps just the thing for you STOP
START well ! ! STOP
START UNK about UNK tile , UNK or similar arts and UNK ? ? STOP
START some people love to UNK tile and it's amazing what beautiful designs they come up with as a result of their cracking good time STOP
START how about the art of cooking ? ? STOP
START do you UNK to make UNK and UNK , or special UNK and UNK ? ? STOP
START there is always an open market for this sort of UNK , in spite of low UNK UNK , UNK UNK and UNK to the contrary STOP
START some people can UNK most anything out of a piece of wood STOP
START some make beautiful UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK houses , etc STOP
START perhaps you couldn't do that but have you ever tried to see what you could do with a UNK of wood ? ? STOP
START outside of cutting your fingers , maybe you would come up with nothing at all , but then again , you might turn out some UNK little UNK STOP
START some women get a real UNK out of UNK STOP
START they love to dust , UNK , UNK , UNK UNK , move the furniture around from place to place , take down the UNK , put up new ones and have themselves a real ball STOP
START maybe that's your UNK STOP
START it certainly isn't mine STOP
START i can look at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that's where it belongs STOP
START perhaps you would like to become a writer STOP
START this gives you a wide and varied choice STOP
START will it be short stories , fiction , UNK , UNK , poetry , children's stories , or even a book if you are really UNK ? ? STOP
START ever since i was a child , i have always had a UNK to try my hand at writing STOP
START if you do decide to write , you will soon become UNK with UNK UNK and UNK STOP
START don't be discouraged ! ! STOP
START this is just being a normal writer STOP
START just let the UNK UNK fall where they may , and keep on UNK , and finally you will make the grade STOP
START few new writers have their first story accepted , so they tell me STOP
START but , it could happen , and it may happen to you STOP
START then there's always UNK , UNK UNK , UNK , UNK , salt and pepper UNK , UNK , dogs , UNK , UNK , or shall we just say UNK anything your heart desires ? ? STOP
START i can hear some of you UNK UNK STOP
START you say , `` but it costs a lot of money to have a UNK STOP
START i UNK got that kind of money '' STOP
START true ! ! STOP
START it does cost a lot of money for most UNK but there are UNK that are for free STOP
START how about a rock collection , or a collection of leaves from different trees or UNK and in different colors ? ? STOP
START then , take flowers STOP
START they are many and varied STOP
START also , there's UNK books , UNK newspaper pictures and UNK , or any items of interest to you STOP
START it's getting interested in something that counts STOP
START as for me , i am holding in reserve two huge UNK ( i love UNK ) to put together when time UNK heavy on my hands STOP
START so far , the covers have never been off the UNK STOP
START i just don't have time to do half the things i want to do now STOP
START so in UNK , fellow retired members , i UNK you to make the most of each day , enjoy each one to the UNK degree STOP
START travel , if you can STOP
START keep occupied to the point you are not UNK with life and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to be UNK sweet STOP
START good luck ! ! STOP
START to one and all -- good days ahead ! ! STOP
START an important UNK of maturity is UNK STOP
START the mature person is creative STOP
START what does it mean to be creative , a term we hear with increasing frequency these days ? ? STOP
START when we turn to UNK UNK we find him helpful as usual STOP
START `` to be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist -- to produce where nothing was before -- to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power '' STOP
START we are creative , it seems , when we produce something which has not previously existed STOP
START thus UNK may run all the way from making a UNK , building a chicken UNK , or producing a book , to founding a business , creating a league of nations or , developing a mature character STOP
START all living creatures from the UNK form of insect or animal life evidence the power of UNK , if it is only to UNK a form like their own STOP
START while man shares this UNK function with all his UNK in the UNK process , he is the only animal with a true UNK and conscious creative ability STOP
START an animal , bird or insect UNK either a UNK , or UNK or UNK in UNK UNK according to UNK STOP
START man's great UNK over these UNK UNK is in the development of his imagination STOP
START this gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old UNK , ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and UNK forms STOP
START it has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by UNK this inner image into its UNK in the objective world STOP
START in our own time we have seen the most fantastic UNK of a UNK UNK come into UNK STOP
START the vision of a lord UNK expressed in a poem 100 years ago took visible form over london in the air UNK of UNK STOP
START in fact all of our UNK world is the resultant of man's UNK of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more STOP
START it is in this one aspect , at least , that man seems to be made in the image of his creator STOP
START not only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms , but even more UNK , he can turn it UNK to help create new and better forms of himself STOP
START we recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training can become UNK , UNK , dancers , musicians and artists , developing many UNK STOP
START we know that UNK can learn to UNK a wide variety of character roles STOP
START by this same combination of the will and the imagination , each one of us can learn to UNK UNK the kind of character we would like to be STOP
START we must realize with UNK UNK in his the open self that `` man is the being that can continually UNK himself , the UNK that is himself the material for his own creation '' STOP
START so far in history man has been too greatly UNK with UNK things into his environment rather than first creating the sort of person who can make the highest use of the things he has created STOP
START is not the present world crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us and between UNK of sufficient wisdom and character to UNK the tragedy STOP
START is it not the obligation of us older citizens to UNK our weight to being creative on the character side and to UNK our own UNK process ? ? STOP
START sir UNK UNK in his book UNK of man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in being the only animal which requires a long period of UNK and childhood under family protection , so is he the only animal who has a long period after the decline of his UNK STOP
START some recent writings assume that the UNK young UNK are a thing of the remote , UNK past ; ; STOP
START that UNK all UNK are thoroughly familiar with the best UNK and know enough from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and UNK out of the situation STOP
START perhaps -- but extensive discussions with contemporary UNK , family doctors and UNK indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance STOP
START UNK and talking may be UNK and easier , but the important UNK information is still lacking for far too many UNK men and women STOP
START various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in making the first UNK a good rather than a bad memory for one or both STOP
START UNK must be highly assured both in time and place STOP
START that is , locking the room or UNK door gives UNK of location , but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough for an utterly UNK UNK STOP
START if the UNK party UNK late , and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before UNK the trip or making an early start , the husband may UNK tensions and UNK by UNK to his UNK that lying in each UNK arms will be UNK enough for these few hours STOP
START the UNK should come at the next UNK place when they have a long private time ( day or night ) for that purpose STOP
START first UNK for the UNK brings with it the various problems connected with UNK and the hymen STOP
START one thing should be clear to both husband and wife -- neither pain nor UNK UNK has to occur when the hymen is UNK during the first sex act STOP
START ignorance on this point has caused a great deal of UNK anxiety , UNK and suspicion STOP
START the hymen is , in essence , a UNK UNK that more or less completely covers the entrance to the UNK in most female human beings who have not had sex relations STOP
START ( hymen , in fact , is the greek word for UNK STOP
START ) STOP
START often it is thin and UNK and gives way readily to the male UNK at the first attempt at UNK STOP
START as might be expected , girls in this situation UNK very little and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their UNK STOP
START it is also important to realize that many girls are born without a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one ; ; STOP
START so that the absence of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex relations STOP
START but there is a basis in fact for the UNK of the UNK beliefs STOP
START some UNK are so strongly developed that they cannot be UNK without considerable pain to the girl and marked loss of blood STOP
START more rarely , the hymen is so UNK that it does not yield to penetration STOP
START extreme cases are on record in which the doctor has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit UNK relations to be UNK STOP
START these cases , for all their UNK , are so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen is a serious problem to UNK STOP
START in recent times , when sexual matters began to be discussed more UNK and more openly , the emotional aspects of UNK received considerable attention STOP
START obviously , the UNK pair has many adjustments to make to their new situation STOP
START is it necessary to add to the other tensions the UNK of making the UNK husband the one who brought pain to his UNK ? ? STOP
START UNK and marriage UNK began to UNK that the UNK should UNK a UNK before marriage STOP
START if he UNK any problem because of the quality of the hymen , it was recommended that simple procedures be undertaken at once to UNK the hymen or , preferably , to UNK it STOP
START as a natural UNK of this approach it was often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for UNK UNK by UNK the UNK STOP
START this recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only UNK to smooth UNK of the sex act STOP
START the UNK is an UNK capable of remarkable contraction and UNK STOP
START this is obvious when it is remembered that , during UNK , the UNK must UNK enough to permit the passage of the baby STOP
START the UNK system of muscles that manage the contraction and UNK of the UNK are partly under voluntary control STOP
START but an UNK UNK may work against the conscious intention of the woman STOP
START that is , when first penetration takes place , the pressure and pain signals may UNK cause all the UNK muscles to contract in an effort to bar the UNK and prevent further pain STOP
START the advantages of UNK by the UNK are both physical and psychological STOP
START since it is a purely professional situation , none of the pain is associated with UNK or the beloved STOP
START by using instruments of gradually increasing size , the UNK is gently , and with minimum pain at each stage , taught to yield to an object of the appropriate shape STOP
START in this process the UNK muscles come under better conscious control by the girl STOP
START she UNK how to relax them to accept -- instead of UNK them to UNK -- the entering object STOP
START apart from the standard problem of controlling the UNK muscles , other serious UNK may exist that need special UNK treatment STOP
START it is far better to have such conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the UNK where they can create a really serious situation STOP
START when no medical problems exist , the newly married couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves STOP
START special information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still of great value STOP
START UNK , UNK and remembered passages from UNK literature can create physical and emotional problems if UNK taken as scientific facts and useful UNK STOP
START the importance of UNK UNK is obvious STOP
START the long , UNK approach and the UNK UNK of UNK work on several levels STOP
START under the excitement of UNK and sexual UNK the UNK UNK and UNK and the local UNK greatly increases , providing an excellent UNK to help achieve an easier penetration STOP
START extensive observations by UNK during UNK UNK have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the UNK wall ( the top line of the UNK as the woman lies on her back ) may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin STOP
START but during the same examination , two fingers may be inserted along the UNK wall ( the bottom of the UNK in the same position ) without any pain ; ; STOP
START and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times STOP
START these regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest UNK STOP
START the husband and wife should start with this UNK information clearly in mind STOP
START they may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too much pressure on the UNK and the UNK wall of the UNK ; ; STOP
START at least until repeated UNK has UNK it and pain is no longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of UNK STOP
START in fact , the technical procedure in medical UNK may be UNK adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the UNK STOP
START UNK talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing the girl a favor if he is UNK and UNK during the first penetration STOP
START the false UNK is that a gradual advance UNK the pain while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased with his UNK and UNK for his UNK in UNK the problem once and for all STOP
START such talk is seriously in error STOP
START UNK at this time can be a very severe shock to the UNK , both physically and UNK STOP
START the UNK , UNK penetration may UNK and UNK the UNK walls as well as do excessive damage to the hymen STOP
START the pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a UNK UNK of UNK relations and cause her , UNK , to make the sex act UNK and difficult for both by UNK her UNK muscles to UNK his penetration instead of UNK them to UNK it STOP
START serious attention must also be given to the UNK problems in the UNK situation STOP
START the necessity for keeping alert to his UNK UNK can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous desire STOP
START the emotional UNK may be so great that he may experience a UNK climax STOP
START this is a very common experience and should in no way UNK or UNK either husband or wife STOP
START or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the UNK pace of the UNK can put him off UNK and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period STOP
START the signals to proceed may therefore come when he is UNK not able to take advantage of them STOP
START the best course is to UNK his physical excitement by a change of pace that makes him UNK again STOP
START this may require imagination and UNK himself that now he can be demanding and UNK STOP
START he can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost STOP
START now while he uses talk , UNK or requires UNK from her , his UNK will UNK understand the situation and UNK help him UNK his physical situation so they can have the UNK they both so UNK desire STOP
START a final word STOP
START the UNK information on this point shows that first UNK , even when it is achieved with minimum pain or difficulty , is seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman STOP
START too many new things are happening for it to be a complete UNK UNK STOP
START only under rare circumstances would a UNK experience an UNK during her first UNK STOP
START both man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax , and even the absence of the UNK UNK pleasure are not a sign that the wife may be cold or UNK STOP
START if the early approaches are wise , understanding and patient , the UNK of UNK UNK will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older STOP
START writing in a large volume on the nude in painting and UNK , UNK the nude : a study in ideal form , UNK clark UNK : `` the human body , as a UNK , is rich in associations STOP
START it is ourselves and UNK UNK of all the things we wish to do with ourselves '' STOP
START perhaps this is a UNK to the amazing variety and power of reactions , attitudes , and emotions UNK by the nude form STOP
START the wide UNK of reactions is clearly illustrated in the UNK studies in human UNK STOP
START differences were related to social , economic , and educational UNK STOP
START whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt to avoid or be UNK by UNK , those educated beyond the eighth grade increasingly UNK and approved UNK in sexual relations STOP
START such understanding helps to explain why one UNK UNK UNK years of married life could UNK with some pride that her husband had `` never seen her entirely naked '' , while another woman , UNK an equal number of years of married life , is proud of having `` shared the UNK way of life -- the really free , natural nude life -- for most of that period '' STOP
START attempts at UNK always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions STOP
START the UNK UNK sees the nude or UNK human form as `` UNK and UNK , a threat and danger '' to all the young , or good , or religious , or moral persons STOP
START the equally UNK UNK of freedom from any kind of UNK may find the nude human form the `` natural , honest , free expression of man's spirit and the UNK of beauty and UNK '' STOP
START one is always a little UNK to UNK into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected STOP
START i still recall the UNK shock i experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic UNK of the `` clean , UNK , free way of natural life in UNK '' , who seemed to brave much UNK and UNK in fine spirit STOP
START in tradition and in poetry , the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony STOP
START the UNK each bring to it UNK love , and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy STOP
START at its most UNK moments , husband and wife are UNK far above UNK UNK STOP
START everything else is closed away STOP
START this is the ideal STOP
START but marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved STOP
START instead one partner or the other UNK the sexual relationship STOP
START in the past , it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife UNK STOP
START but today there are signs that these roles are being UNK STOP
START in a growing number of american homes , marriage UNK report , the wife is taking a UNK role in sexual relationships STOP
START it is she who UNK the time , the place , the UNK , and the frequency of the sexual act STOP
START it is she who says UNK or UNK to the UNK questions of sexual technique and mechanics -- not the husband STOP
START the whole act is UNK to her pleasure , and not to theirs STOP
START beyond a certain point , of course , no woman can be dominant -- nature has seen to that STOP
START but there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is UNK of the UNK bed STOP
START of course , there remain many `` UNK '' marriages in which the husband maintains his UNK STOP
START yet even in these marriages , psychologists say , wives are UNK themselves more strongly STOP
START the UNK , most UNK wife of today is a UNK by her mother's or UNK standards STOP
START to many experts , this trend was inevitable STOP
START they consider it simply a sign of our times STOP
START our society has `` UNK '' the woman , giving her new independence and new authority STOP
START it is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role STOP
START `` the sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum '' , UNK UNK UNK UNK , medical director of the planned UNK UNK of america and author of the recent book , release from sexual tensions STOP
START `` it reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself STOP
START a world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual relationships in which wives are more UNK , too '' STOP
START yet many psychologists and marriage UNK agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be UNK and even dangerous STOP
START it can , in fact , UNK a marriage STOP
START when a husband is UNK UNK and UNK of his UNK desires , she is UNK of the UNK and pleasure nature intended for her STOP
START and she begins to regard him as UNK , UNK and UNK STOP
START on the other hand , UNK UNK UNK the husband , UNK his UNK , and UNK him of his UNK STOP
START he is a target of UNK to his wife , and often -- since private affairs rarely remain private -- to the outside world as well STOP
START `` a marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the UNK UNK '' , UNK UNK STOP
START this opinion is supported by one of the nation's leading UNK , UNK UNK , director of the mental health division of the philadelphia department of public health STOP
START `` when the roles of husband and wife are UNK , so that the wife becomes leader and the husband UNK '' , UNK says , `` the effects on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be UNK '' STOP
START in one extreme case , cited by a UNK UNK , an office UNK wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the UNK she demanded STOP
START to win her UNK , her husband first took an additional job , then UNK began to UNK from his UNK STOP
START caught at last , he was UNK to prison STOP
START while he was in UNK his wife UNK him STOP
START more typical is the case of a suburban long island UNK described by a marriage UNK STOP
START this woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired '' for UNK relations STOP
START to please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic UNK STOP
START finally , he was cooking , washing UNK , UNK the children , and even UNK -- and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them STOP
START one wife , described by a new york UNK , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly UNK meetings and the UNK neighborhood card parties STOP
START another put sex on a UNK basis STOP
START after every money argument , she UNK her UNK UNK until the matter was settled in her favor STOP
START experts say the UNK in marriages like these can almost be UNK STOP
START the wife is likely to be young , sophisticated , UNK as a UNK -- often a girl who has UNK a promising career for marriage STOP
START she knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to UNK her husband STOP
START the husband is usually a UNK professional , UNK with his job -- often an organization man whose UNK for getting ahead is : `` don't rock the boat '' STOP
START sometimes this leads to his becoming UNK dominant in marriage STOP
START UNK in on the job and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area STOP
START more often , though , he is so UNK to UNK to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home STOP
START some psychologists , in fact , suggest that UNK UNK often are more to UNK for UNK marriages than their wives STOP
START the UNK attempt at control , these psychologists UNK , is sometimes merely a UNK effort to UNK her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job STOP
START naturally no woman can ever completely UNK the sexual initiative STOP
START unless her husband also desires sex , the act cannot be UNK STOP
START generally , however , in such marriages as those cited , the husband is at his UNK mercy STOP
START `` the pattern '' , says UNK UNK , UNK at new UNK lincoln institute for UNK , `` is for the husband to UNK about UNK and UNK , virtually UNK in his hope that she will UNK him the signal that UNK is the night '' STOP
START no one seriously UNK , of course , that the UNK wife is , UNK speaking , a new character in our world STOP
START after all , the UNK husband with his UNK wife is a UNK figure of long standing , in literature and on the stage , as UNK points out STOP
START there is no evidence that these UNK became suddenly UNK when they crossed the UNK of the master UNK STOP
START furthermore , UNK says , a certain number of UNK , UNK men always have been around STOP
START they aren't `` UNK '' and they aren't UNK ; ; STOP
START they're just UNK in all of life STOP
START they like to be dominated STOP
START one such man once UNK to UNK UNK , new york UNK , that he preferred to have his wife the sexual UNK STOP
START asked why , he replied UNK : `` because that's no activity for a gentleman '' STOP
START but such cases were , in the past , unusual STOP
START society here and abroad has been built around the UNK male -- even the bible appears to UNK the concept STOP
START family survival on our own western frontier , for example , could quite literally depend on a man's strength and ability to bring home the UNK ; ; STOP
START and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything , including the marriage bed STOP
START this carried over into the more UNK late UNK and early UNK centuries , when the man ruled the UNK in the best UNK life with father manner STOP
START in those days , a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere STOP
START `` UNK wasn't expected to like it '' , UNK UNK , the late UNK UNK , once UNK up the attitude of the UNK STOP
START wives of the period UNK thought of themselves as `` used '' by their UNK -- and , history indicates , they often quite literally were STOP
START when was the turning point ? ? STOP
START when did women begin to assert themselves UNK ? ? STOP
START some date it from woman UNK , others from when women first began to challenge men in the UNK , still others from the era of the UNK UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START virtually everyone UNK , however , that the trend toward female sexual UNK was UNK UNK with the postwar UNK to the suburbs STOP
START left alone while her husband was miles away in the city , the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male STOP
START circumstances gave her almost UNK UNK over UNK , UNK and home maintenance STOP
START she found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless STOP
START she liked this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give it up STOP
START `` very few wives '' , says UNK , `` who balance the UNK , UNK the car , choose where the family will live and deal with the UNK , are suddenly going to become UNK where sex is concerned STOP
START a woman who UNK other family affairs will UNK the sexual relationship as well '' STOP
START and an additional factor was helping to make women more UNK UNK -- the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response STOP
START marriage UNK and women's magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax STOP
START they began to describe in detail the UNK capacity for response STOP
START in fact , the noted UNK and sex UNK , UNK UNK , has declared UNK that women are `` UNK superior '' to men STOP
START according to UNK , the average UNK american woman is capable of far greater sexual UNK than her partner STOP
START not surprisingly , UNK says , some recently UNK wives are out to claim these capabilities STOP
START yet , UNK , according to UNK UNK , many wives UNK their UNK for not standing up to them STOP
START an aggressive woman wants a man to demand , not UNK under STOP
START `` when the husband becomes UNK in the face of his UNK UNK '' , UNK says , `` the wife , in turn , finds him inadequate STOP
START often she UNK to gain sexual satisfaction '' STOP
START one such wife , UNK says , became UNK with her weak husband and UNK through a series of UNK affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man STOP
START but her personality was such that each affair UNK only until that UNK , too , had been UNK and reduced to UNK STOP
START then the wife UNK to the next on the list STOP
START in some cases , however , domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary , UNK by a passing but UNK emotional need STOP
START thus a man who is UNK a stone wall at the office may become UNK aggressive in bed -- the one place he can still be UNK STOP
START if his UNK problems work out , he may return to his old pattern STOP
START sometimes a burst of UNK will UNK over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she feels age UNK up STOP
START on the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and UNK may suddenly become UNK -- asking , psychologists say , for UNK that his wife still finds him desirable STOP
START or a wife may make sudden demands that she be UNK , UNK or UNK , simply because she needs her UNK UNK STOP
START in any case , UNK remarks , such problems are a UNK own affair , and can't always be measured by a general UNK STOP
START `` as long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex , it makes little difference if one or the other UNK '' , UNK UNK STOP
START `` the important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment '' STOP
START other experts say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period , it is likely to UNK the marriage STOP
START and just as domination today often begins with the wife , so the cure generally must lie with the husband STOP
START `` to get a marriage back where it belongs '' , comments UNK of the lincoln institute , `` the husband must take some very basic steps STOP
START he must begin , UNK , by becoming more UNK STOP
START he must become more UNK of his own desires , more demanding and less ' understanding ' '' STOP
START too many UNK , UNK continues , worry about `` how well they're doing '' , and fear that their success depends on some UNK or technique of sexual play STOP
START she gave herself a title , lady UNK UNK STOP
START the new york UNK her another , the golden girl of UNK society STOP
START UNK police gave her a third , less UNK , title , UNK STOP
START and UNK police have the final say in the matter since she died there on september 20 , 1960 , `` diane UNK UNK , 30 , UNK circumstances -- unusual '' STOP
START early in her life she had discovered that where there were men , there was money , and with the two came luxury and liquor STOP
START she was still in the play for pay business when she died , a top UNK who had given the world's UNK profession one of its rare UNK of UNK STOP
START she never UNK the fact that she liked to play STOP
START her neighbors in the expensive UNK apartment building told reporters that the UNK beauty had talked at times about her past as `` the golden girl of the UNK UNK trial '' STOP
START it was the trial of UNK UNK UNK ( UNK ) UNK for UNK UNK in new york that put the UNK on the international UNK STOP
START ( UNK later served 21 months when he was found guilty of UNK a ring of UNK call girls STOP
START ) STOP
START diane was needed as a material witness in the case and new york police UNK three UNK before they found her in their own back yard -- in a UNK hotel , of course STOP
START she had been moving in UNK society as lady UNK UNK , a name that made some of the UNK columns STOP
START it was when she was UNK as a material witness that she got the UNK she liked best STOP
START UNK in UNK and UNK , she UNK to assistant district attorney UNK UNK describe her to the UNK judge : STOP
START `` this girl is the golden girl of UNK society STOP
START `` in 1951 she was a UNK in new york county STOP
START in the spring and early summer of that year she met a UNK foreign UNK who took her to france , where she later met a very UNK man and UNK all europe with him STOP
START `` at UNK she met an UNK by the name of pulley UNK STOP
START he was the official UNK for king UNK , now in UNK STOP
START she was in egypt during the revolution and had UNK difficulty STOP
START she UNK in order to get it STOP
START `` we have checked her in different parts of europe and egypt and finally back into this country STOP
START she has been acting as a UNK STOP

START diane UNK denied this to the court STOP
START `` that's a lie STOP
START i never gave that boy a cent STOP
START i am not a UNK , and i had only one very UNK boy friend '' , she said STOP
START during the course of the trial , UNK UNK up part of that statement STOP
START `` diane is the type of girl '' , UNK said , `` who wouldn't get UNK -- even on her UNK night -- unless you UNK up all your money in the middle of the floor '' STOP
START but she seemed to have UNK the number of her `` boy friends '' STOP
START she came to new york from UNK as a UNK , but with a `` UNK '' instead of a UNK STOP
START as she told it , `` he's a rich boy friend , an old UNK about 60 '' STOP
START she was mary UNK UNK then , UNK , but not naive STOP
START she had talked her `` boy friend '' into sending her to new york to take a screen test STOP
START the screen test was never made -- but diane was STOP
START she quickly moved into UNK society , possibly UNK her conscience by talking constantly of her desire to be in show business STOP
START she seemed so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail circuit set up a practical UNK STOP
START an UNK was introduced to her in a bar as `` UNK , the famous UNK '' STOP
START the UNK UNK asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows STOP
START `` UNK love to UNK for you '' , she UNK STOP
START the UNK was held a few minutes later in UNK apartment STOP
START she thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show the UNK UNK how well she could dance STOP
START after a few minutes he said , `` i can't use you if you dance like that STOP
START UNK like to see you dance nude '' STOP
START she UNK UNK STOP
START diane loved to dance in the nude , something she was to demonstrate time and again STOP
START she developed another UNK habit STOP
START even among the fast set in which she was moving , her method for keeping an UNK from UNK too early was unique STOP
START when the date would try to bid her UNK at the door , she would tell him , `` if you go home now , i'll UNK '' STOP
START more often than not he would UNK to the inevitable STOP
START one who needed no such UNK was a french UNK STOP
START one of the UNK UNK that he satisfied was for travel STOP
START she wanted to go around the world , but she settled for a french holiday STOP
START in an UNK interview with a french newspaper the UNK told of spending several months with her STOP
START `` then she went to UNK where she met a member of a powerful greek UNK of UNK '' STOP
START the greek evidently fell for her , `` UNK x '' UNK , and to UNK what he thought was an affair in the making he gave her UNK UNK ( about UNK ) and led her to the UNK tables STOP
START she could do no wrong at the tables that time STOP

START the medical device UNK of today , of course , is a far more sophisticated operator than his UNK of UNK -- the UNK UNK of UNK oil and other patent UNK STOP

START that's why the UNK , the american medical association ( UNK ) , and the national better business bureau ( UNK ) have estimated the UNK of mechanical UNK to be a substantial portion of the UNK million or so paid to medical UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK general recently reported that mail order UNK -- among which UNK therapeutic devices figure UNK -- are at the highest level in history STOP
START similarly , the american cancer society ( UNK ) , the UNK and UNK foundation , and the UNK have each stated UNK that medical UNK is at a new high STOP
START for example , the UNK has reported it was receiving four times as many inquiries about UNK devices and 10 times as many UNK compared with two years ago STOP
START authorities UNK to quote exact figures , however , UNK that any sum they come up with is only a surface UNK -- turned up by their inevitably limited UNK -- of the real UNK of the medical UNK STOP
START in this sense , authorities believe that all estimates of UNK device UNK are conservative STOP
START the economic UNK that the device UNK UNK is important , of course STOP
START but it is our health -- more precious than all the money in the world -- that these modern UNK doctors with their UNK therapeutic UNK are UNK away STOP
START by UNK on the sick , by playing UNK on the hopes of the desperate , by causing the UNK to delay proper medical care , these medical UNK create pain and misery by their very activity STOP
START typically , UNK gross and UNK both lost more than their money as the result of their experiences with their UNK UNK STOP
START UNK gross found that the treatments given her for a UNK UNK by the UNK were not helping her STOP
START as a result , she UNK medical authorities and learned that the devices her UNK `` doctor '' was using were UNK STOP
START she suffered a UNK UNK and had to be UNK STOP
START UNK her fellow UNK , also experienced a UNK UNK just as soon as he discovered that he had been UNK of his life savings by the limited UNK who had been UNK his wife -- a woman suffering from an UNK disease , multiple UNK -- and himself STOP

START `` neither me nor my wife were helped by that UNK treatments '' STOP
START and there was the case of tom UNK , a UNK , who was referred by a friend to a health machine UNK who treated him with a so-called UNK machine for what doctor UNK said was a system full of UNK and UNK STOP
START after his UNK got worse , tom decided to see a real doctor , from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung STOP
START yes , tom caught it in time to stay alive STOP
START but he's a welfare case now -- a human UNK -- thanks to this modern UNK doctor STOP
START but the machine UNK can cause far more than just suffering STOP
START in such diseases as cancer , UNK , and heart disease , early UNK and treatment are so vital that the waste of time by the patient with doctor UNK UNK UNK can prove fatal STOP
START moreover , the UNK patient who UNK on cure by the UNK device and therefore cuts off his UNK UNK can be UNK UNK STOP
START for instance : STOP
START in chicago , some time ago , UNK age 27 , a UNK since he was six , stopped using UNK because he had bought a `` magic UNK '' -- a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with UNK UNK worth a small fraction of a cent -- sold by the UNK company of chicago for UNK as a UNK STOP

START although she weighed only UNK pounds when she visited him , UNK permitted her to go on a UNK fast in which she took nothing but water STOP
START inevitably , UNK died of UNK and UNK , UNK 60 pounds STOP
START moreover , her husband and child UNK UNK her STOP
START ( small wonder a UNK jury awarded the husband UNK for his UNK death STOP
START ) STOP
START in california , a few years ago , a UNK by the name of UNK sold electric UNK as a cure for cancer STOP
START he did this by the UNK practice of buying up used electric UNK for UNK to UNK from UNK of patients who had died , UNK them , and selling them at UNK each STOP
START when authorities UNK him of UNK medicine without a license ( he got off with a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of UNK ) , one of his UNK was not around to UNK : he was dead of cancer STOP
START by no means are these isolated cases STOP
START `` unfortunately '' , says chief UNK UNK david UNK , who has UNK many device UNK , `` the UNK who trade on the hopes of the UNK ill often cannot be successfully UNK because the patients who are the chief UNK die before the case is called up in court '' STOP
START death ! ! STOP
START have no doubt about it STOP
START that's where device UNK can lead STOP
START the evidence shows that UNK therapeutic machines , substituted for valid medical UNK , have UNK the UNK of thousands STOP
START who are the UNK of the device UNK ? ? STOP
START authorities say that UNK are a prime target STOP
START says UNK UNK , director of the UNK division of public information : `` UNK are apt to direct their appeal directly to older people , or to UNK from UNK UNK such as UNK , UNK , UNK , and cancer STOP
START people who have not been able to get relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in by UNK '' STOP

START tooth fit explained STOP
START UNK is the UNK expression for the way teeth fit together when the UNK are closed STOP
START UNK , or a bad fit , is what parents need to look out for STOP
START one main type of UNK is characterized by a UNK UNK and UNK upper front teeth STOP
START a UNK too prominent in relation to the rest of the face , a UNK forward of the lower front teeth , an UNK lower UNK , and an UNK upper UNK indicate the opposite type of UNK STOP
START these two basic UNK have , of course , many variations STOP
START a child probably requires some form of treatment if he has any of the following conditions : STOP
START a UNK UNK of the upper or lower UNK STOP
START UNK , UNK , UNK , or widely UNK teeth STOP
START front teeth not meeting when the back teeth close STOP
START upper teeth completely covering the UNK when the back teeth close STOP
START the UNK ( third from the middle on top , UNK each front tooth as the first ) beginning to UNK like UNK STOP
START second teeth that have come in before the first ones have fallen out , making a double row STOP
START contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago , when all UNK was UNK on some unfortunate habit , recent studies show that most tooth UNK has at least its beginning in UNK UNK STOP
START however , this does not mean that a child's teeth or UNK must necessarily UNK those of someone in his family STOP
START tooth UNK may be the result of excessive UNK or UNK , UNK , or UNK -- but it's important to remember that there's a difference between normal and excessive UNK habits STOP
START it's perfectly normal for UNK to UNK their UNK , and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old STOP
START occasional UNK up to the fifth year may not affect a UNK teeth ; ; STOP
START but after that , if UNK pressure is frequent , it will have an effect STOP
START UNK can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long STOP
START if a child UNK a UNK at the age of two , the UNK teeth may shift toward the empty space , thus UNK the place intended for the permanent ones and producing a UNK STOP
START if baby teeth are retained too long , the UNK second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal time or may have to UNK in the wrong place STOP
START UNK can save teeth STOP
START every UNK sees children who are UNK by their UNK teeth STOP
START some such UNK rarely smile , or they try to speak with the mouth closed STOP
START in certain cases , as in UNK UNK , a child's personality is affected STOP
START yet from the UNK point of view , UNK teeth should be UNK for physical reasons STOP
START bad UNK may result in early loss of teeth through a UNK of the UNK structure that UNK their roots STOP
START this serious condition , UNK known as UNK , is one of the chief causes of tooth loss in adults STOP
START then , too , UNK or UNK teeth are UNK to UNK food particles , increasing the UNK of rapid decay STOP
START `` for these and other reasons '' , says UNK , `` UNK can UNK the life of teeth '' STOP
START the failure of teeth to fit together when closed UNK with normal UNK , so that a child may UNK food whole and put a burden on his UNK system STOP
START because of these UNK UNK , a child may avoid certain foods he needs for adequate UNK STOP
START badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech UNK as UNK STOP
START the when and how of UNK STOP
START `` most UNK work is done on children between the ages of 10 and 14 , though there have been patients as young as two and as old as UNK '' , says UNK STOP
START in the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed , yet the continuing growth of UNK tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy STOP
START UNK work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not UNK , by a system of UNK UNK with an involved UNK network , to the bone in the UNK ; ; STOP
START they are not UNK directly to the bone STOP
START UNK pressure , applied over a period of time , produces a change in the UNK UNK , so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided STOP
START what can UNK UNK expect when she enters the UNK office ? ? STOP
START on her first visit the UNK will take UNK , UNK , tooth measurements , and `` tooth UNK '' -- an impression of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and UNK STOP
START if he UNK to proceed , he will UNK for UNK an UNK consisting of UNK , plastic plates , fine UNK , and tiny springs STOP
START this UNK will UNK a gentle and continuous or UNK pressure on the bone STOP
START as the tooth moves , bone cells on the pressure side of it will UNK , and new ones will form on the side from which the tooth has moved STOP
START this must be done at the rate at which new UNK tissue grows , and no UNK STOP
START `` if teeth are moved too rapidly , serious injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding bone holding them in place '' , explains UNK STOP
START `` moving one or two teeth can affect the whole system , and an UNK plan of treatment can UNK the growth pattern of a child's face '' STOP
START during the first few days of wearing the UNK and immediately following each adjustment , UNK may have a slight UNK or UNK , but after a short time this will UNK STOP
START parents are often concerned that UNK UNK may cause teeth to decay STOP
START when in place , a UNK band actually UNK the part of the tooth that is covered STOP
START next UNK will enter the treatment stage and visit the UNK once or twice a month , depending on the UNK of her condition STOP
START during these visits the UNK will adjust the UNK to increase the pressure on her teeth STOP
START last comes the retention stage STOP
START UNK teeth have now been guided into a desirable new position STOP
START but because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original position , a UNK UNK is used to UNK them in place STOP
START usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the UNK and UNK across the teeth STOP
START UNK may wear this only at night or for a few hours during the day STOP
START then comes the time when the last wire is removed and UNK UNK out a UNK and more attractive girl than when she first went to the UNK STOP
START how long will this take ? ? STOP
START UNK one tooth that has come in wrong may take only a few months STOP
START UNK all the teeth may take a year or more STOP
START an added UNK such as a UNK UNK may take two or three years to correct STOP
START what is the cost ? ? STOP
START the charge for a complete UNK job UNK in various parts of the country STOP
START work that might cost UNK to UNK in the south could cost UNK to UNK in new york city or chicago STOP
START an average national figure for two to three years of treatment would be UNK to UNK STOP
START `` factors in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill and education of the UNK '' , says UNK STOP
START to become an UNK , a man must first be UNK by his state as a UNK , then he must spend at least two years in additional training to acquire a license as a specialist STOP
START `` costs may seem high , but they used to be even higher '' , says UNK STOP
START `` fees are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago '' STOP
START the reason ? ? STOP
START people today are aware of the value of UNK , and as a result there are more UNK in the field STOP
START most UNK require an initial payment to cover the cost of UNK materials and construction of the UNK , but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years STOP
START in many cities in the united states UNK associated with UNK schools will take patients at a UNK UNK STOP
START some municipal agencies will pay for UNK treatment for children of UNK parents STOP
START research helps families STOP
START growth studies have been carried on consistently by UNK STOP
START UNK has UNK records of head growth , started 20 minutes after children's UNK STOP
START `` in the past anyone who said that UNK of all UNK is UNK was UNK at ; ; STOP
START now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large extent '' , he says STOP
START `` fortunately through our growth studies we have been able to see what nature does , and that helps us know what we can do '' STOP
START this knowledge both UNK and UNK UNK and treatment STOP
START for example , a boy may UNK a small UNK from one UNK and large teeth from another STOP
START in the past an UNK might have tried , over four or five years , to UNK and fit the UNK large teeth into a UNK that , despite some growth , would never UNK them STOP
START now a UNK can recommend UNK immediately STOP
START in other cases , in view of present-day knowledge of head growth , UNK will recommend waiting four or five years before treatment STOP
START the child is kept on call , and the UNK UNK the growth STOP
START `` nature often takes care of the problem '' , says UNK STOP
START `` a child with a certain type of head and teeth will UNK tooth UNK '' STOP
START that is why UNK UNK parents not to insist , against their UNK advice , that their child have UNK work done too early STOP
START `` both because of our UNK stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions , some parents demand that the UNK try to correct a problem before it is wise to do so STOP
START let the UNK decide the proper time to start treatment '' , he UNK STOP
START superior new material for UNK work is another result of research STOP
START plastics are easier to handle than the UNK UNK formerly used , and they save time and money STOP
START plaster of paris , once UNK in making impressions of teeth , has been replaced by UNK ( UNK material ) that work quickly and accurately and with least UNK to a child STOP
START prevention is best STOP
START as a rule , the earlier general UNK treatment is started , the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be STOP
START `` after your child's baby teeth are all in -- usually at the age of two and one half to three -- it's time for that first UNK UNK '' , UNK UNK STOP
START `` then see that your UNK has a routine UNK once a year '' STOP
START to help prevent UNK problems from arising , your UNK can do these things : STOP
START he can correct decay , thus UNK early loss of teeth STOP
START if a child does lose his first teeth UNK because of decay -- and if no preventive steps are taken -- the other teeth may shift out of position , become UNK and UNK STOP
START in turn the other teeth are likely to decay because food particles may become UNK in them STOP
START from time to time the medium UNK other people `` around him '' , who were `` on the other side '' , and reports what they are saying STOP
START after a while there come UNK and names , and he is interested to hear some rather unusual family UNK STOP
START as the hour UNK , the sensitive seems to UNK more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements STOP
START there are a few UNK of coming events STOP
START another medium , another sitter , would produce a somewhat different content , but in general it would probably sound much like the UNK reading STOP
START some UNK speak in practical , UNK terms , while others may stress the spiritual STOP
START not all , as a matter of fact , consider themselves `` UNK '' in the sense of receiving messages from the UNK STOP
START in fact , some UNK rule this out , UNK to consider their expression as strictly UNK perception ( UNK ) , on this side of the `` UNK '' STOP
START however that may be , people are known to go to UNK for diverse reasons STOP
START perhaps they are UNK a recent death and want comfort , to feel in touch with the UNK , or seek indications for future plans STOP
START they may , of course , be UNK UNK -- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of UNK STOP
START the UNK with whom the UNK foundation is working in this experiment are in a UNK or only slightly UNK state , so that the sitter can make comments , ask and answer questions , instead of talking with a `` control '' who speaks through an UNK sensitive STOP
START what we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary conversation STOP
START but it is not really only a conversation STOP
START many a sitter ( in a personal sitting ) has been UNK to realize that the medium was describing very UNK his state of mind STOP
START he himself might not have been really aware of his own UNK ; ; STOP
START it had been UNK , UNK , UNK and only partly realized -- until she described it to him ! ! STOP
START most striking indeed is this UNK ability to put a finger on `` UNK '' UNK and to clarify them STOP
START however , in the next visit that the UNK made to the medium , he did not receive a personal reading STOP
START instead he brought with him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium knew nothing STOP
START for this was to be a `` UNK sitting '' STOP
START as was noted earlier , it is important that in valid , objective study of this sort of communication , the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive STOP
START UNK UNK , director of research at the UNK foundation , described the basis for the experiment in a UNK article , ( `` new research on survival after death '' , spring 1958 ) STOP
START he remarked : `` it has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was received UNK by the medium from the sitter '' STOP
START the possibility has to be ruled out that the UNK UNK may tap the memory of the sitter , and to do this , the two central characters in this drama must be separated STOP
START one way to do this is by `` UNK UNK '' , UNK the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute , the UNK sitter STOP
START if the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name ( given by the UNK ) , he cannot possibly give any UNK , conscious or unconscious , far less ask leading questions STOP
START all he can do is to be an objective and careful UNK , seeking to help the sensitive in UNK and making more specific her UNK impressions STOP
START sometimes in these experiments `` UNK UNK '' are used STOP
START here the absent sitter makes a `` date '' with a UNK ( someone close to him who is UNK ) , asking him to `` come in '' at a certain hour , when a channel will be open for him STOP
START in this case the UNK sitter will know only the name of the UNK , nothing else STOP
START he gives this to the medium at the appointed time , and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages from the UNK STOP
START as always , a tape recording or detailed notes are made , and a UNK of this is sent to the absent sitter STOP
START so this UNK situation has set up at least a UNK UNK between the UNK UNK and the absent UNK mind STOP
START it is now harder to assume UNK as a basis for the statements -- though research still does not know how far UNK UNK can range STOP
START now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him STOP
START here again laboratory approaches are being UNK , for it is recognized how `` UNK '' these readings can be , how they can apply to many people , and are often stated in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case STOP
START if you look at a reading meant for someone else , you will probably see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you , even when you were not in the picture at all ! ! STOP
START an interested sitter may think the sensitive has made a `` hit '' , describing something accurately for him , but can he really be sure that another sitter , hearing the same statement , would not apply it UNK to his own circumstances ? ? STOP
START it is , of course , easy to see how `` UNK '' will mean uncle UNK to one person and little UNK to another STOP
START `` a journey '' , `` a little white house '' , `` a change of outlook '' , can apply to many people STOP
START and even more complex items can be interpreted to UNK to one's own point of view , which is by nature so personal STOP
START one sitter may think `` a UNK UNK '' UNK a reading as surely directed to him ; ; STOP
START to another , it seems that nobody but his father ever used the phrase , `` UNK boy '' ! ! STOP
START to get around this quite difficult corner , there is one first aid to UNK : prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him STOP
START if he is not told which of four or five readings was meant for him , he can more readily UNK each item in a larger frame : `` does that statement really sound as if it were for me , significant in my particular life ? ? STOP
START or am i taking something that could really apply to almost anybody , and UNK that many other people probably have had a similar experience '' ? ? STOP
START UNK , UNK would consider as impressive such statements as the following , which , if they turned out to be UNK , are so unusual as to be really significant : STOP
START `` he had four children , two sets of UNK STOP
START after being a lawyer for twenty-five years he started studying for the ministry STOP
START part of his house had been moved to the other side of the road STOP
START he died of UNK in UNK '' STOP
START methods have been developed of UNK `` weights '' to statements ; ; STOP
START that is , it is known UNK that names beginning with r are more common than those beginning with UNK ; ; STOP
START that fewer women are named UNK than UNK ; ; STOP
START that in the united states more people die of heart disease than of UNK STOP
START so each reading can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these weights STOP
START specific dates would be important , as would double names STOP
START various categories have been UNK to find out about these `` empirical probabilities '' against which to measure the readings STOP
START in the UNK foundation's long-range experiment , readings are made by a variety of UNK for a large number of UNK UNK , trying to throw light on this question of the significance of UNK statements STOP
START it is very important indeed , in the field of UNK perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis , to know whether the statements are actually only those which any UNK person might venture and an eager sitter UNK to himself STOP
START or , on the other hand , are UNK facts being stated , facts which are in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody ? ? STOP
START that is one thing the experiments are designed to find out STOP
START so , after the sitting has been held , several readings at one time are mailed , and the distant sitter ( whose name or whose UNK name was given to the medium ) must mark each little item as correct ( hit ) , UNK ( miss ) , doubtful , or especially significant ( applying to him and , he feels , not to anyone else ) STOP
START he is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his STOP
START all these UNK are then UNK up and UNK , by adding up the UNK and UNK , with the weight placed on those in the UNK own reading STOP
START that is , if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him , the total experimental score falls STOP
START UNK , if he gives a heavy UNK to his own reading , and finds more accurate facts in it than in the others , a point is UNK up for the UNK , objective UNK of this type of UNK material STOP
START and there are some positive results , though the final findings will not be known for a long time -- and then further research can be formulated STOP
START in another approach to the same procedure , the content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium is likely to UNK her statements STOP
START does she often speak of locations , of cause of death ? ? STOP
START does she accurately give dates , ages , kind of occupation ? ? STOP
START it is possible to find out in which categories most of her correct statements fall , and where she makes most of her `` UNK '' STOP
START now when , so to speak , the cream has been UNK off , and the items in the successful categories separated out , the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated `` cream '' , where the sensitive is at her best STOP
START UNK impressions are evidently of all UNK and seem to involve all the UNK STOP
START `` i feel cold '' , the medium says , or `` my leg UNK '' , `` my head is heavy '' STOP
START or perhaps she UNK words or sounds : `` there's such a noise of UNK machinery '' , or `` i hear a child UNK '' , or `` he says UNK all here and UNK to see you '' STOP
START maybe an entire scene comes into consciousness , with action and motion , or a UNK view : `` a house under a UNK tree , with a little stone path going up to the door '' STOP
START the sensitive often seems to UNK definite UNK , too , or UNK feels emotions STOP
START sometimes she displays amazing UNK UNK and seems to see all details in perspective , as if the scene were actually there STOP
START if pressed by the sitter for more detail , she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply , almost as if she were physically going closer STOP
START if asked how she gets her impressions , she probably can only say that she `` just gets them '' -- some more UNK than others STOP
START perhaps this is not so extraordinary after all STOP
START even in normal experience one gets impressions without knowing exactly how -- of atmosphere , of one UNK UNK , UNK , UNK STOP
START of course , there is an element of training here : these UNK people , by concentration , study , guidance , have learned to develop their power STOP
START simply using it increases its intensity , i was told by one sensitive STOP
START nor does a medium automatically know how to UNK her UNK STOP
START impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value STOP
START it is apparently by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious , and the medium has to UNK these into meaning STOP
START if communication with an UNK on the `` other side '' is taking place , this too may assume the form of UNK UNK STOP
START during one reading an image appeared of a UNK in UNK STOP
START but this did not necessarily refer to an actual UNK ; ; STOP
START taken with other details it could have referred to a state of mental or spiritual UNK STOP
START in this connection it is worth noting how names are sometimes obtained STOP
START though they are often heard UNK , as if a voice were speaking them , in other cases they are UNK UNK as symbols : a slope to UNK the name `` hill '' , for instance STOP
START one medium saw two sheets UNK on a line and found that the name UNK was significant to the sitter STOP
START farming is UNK STOP
START the UNK life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock STOP
START livestock must be tended every day , UNK STOP
START a slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or UNK STOP
START even if there are no livestock , the UNK cannot leave the farm for long periods , particularly during the growing season STOP
START the worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily STOP
START he cannot leave the farm to take work in another UNK on short notice ; ; STOP
START such a move may mean a loss of capital STOP
START hard physical labor and UNK hours are a part of life STOP
START the UNK must get up early , and , at times , work late at night STOP
START frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain STOP
START no matter how well work is planned , bad weather or unexpected UNK can cause extra work that must be caught up STOP
START it may not be profitable for a part-time UNK to own the UNK machinery that a full-time UNK can UNK in UNK STOP
START production may fall far below expectations STOP
START UNK , UNK , disease , and insects take their UNK of crops STOP
START UNK or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the UNK UNK , even into his capital STOP
START returns for money and labor UNK may be small even in a good year STOP
START the high cost of land , supplies , and labor make it difficult to farm UNK on a part-time basis STOP
START land within UNK distance of a growing city is usually high in price , higher if it has UNK possibilities STOP
START part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller UNK STOP
START if the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high , farm labor costs will also be high STOP
START a part-time UNK needs unusual skill to get as high production per UNK , per cow , or per UNK as can be obtained by a competent full-time UNK STOP
START it will frequently be UNK for him to own the most UNK equipment STOP
START he may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations , such as UNK or UNK , and for these , he may have to wait his turn STOP
START there will be losses caused by UNK that arise while he is away at his UNK job STOP
START the farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lost STOP
START this may be true whether the farm is owned or UNK STOP
START if the farm is UNK , the rent must be paid STOP
START if it is owned , taxes must be paid , and if the place is not free of mortgage , there will be interest and payments on the principal to take care of STOP
START advantages STOP
START a farm provides a UNK and UNK environment for children STOP
START it gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air STOP
START the children can do UNK adapted to their age and ability STOP
START UNK for a UNK , a UNK , or some UNK UNK in children a sense of responsibility for work STOP
START part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost , provided the farm is owned free of UNK and UNK enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs STOP
START for some retired persons , part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income STOP
START it is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of UNK for their health STOP
START generally , the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city STOP
START the savings are not as great , however , as is UNK supposed STOP
START usually , the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and UNK somewhat more STOP
START where schools , fire and police protection , and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country , real estate taxes are usually about the same STOP
START a part-time UNK and his family can use their spare time UNK STOP
START some persons consider the work on a farm UNK STOP
START for some UNK workers it is a welcome change from the regular job , and a physical UNK STOP
START land , labor , and equipment needed STOP
START part-time farming can take comparatively little land , labor , and equipment -- or a great deal STOP
START it depends on the kind and the scale of the farming operation STOP
START general requirements for land , labor , and equipment are discussed below STOP
START specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14 STOP
START land STOP
START three quarters to 1 UNK of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use , and for a small UNK of UNK , a cow , and two UNK STOP
START you could not , of course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small STOP
START if you want to raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale , you'll need more land STOP
START in UNK how much land you want , take into account the amount you'll need to bring in the income you expect STOP
START but consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your other work STOP
START the cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision STOP
START some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development STOP
START this is a highly UNK venture STOP
START sometimes a desired UNK is offered only as part of a larger UNK STOP
START when surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep up , it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an UNK that the development of UNK properties might UNK the residential value of the farm STOP
START labor STOP
START if you have a UNK , full-time job you can't expect to grow much more than your family uses -- unless other members of the family do a good deal of the work or you UNK help STOP
START as a rule , part-time farmers UNK little help STOP
START in UNK on the enterprises to be managed by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 STOP
START list the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month STOP
START you may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one STOP
START do not include all your spare time or all your UNK spare time -- only what you are willing to use for farm work STOP
START equipment STOP
START if you are going to produce for home use only , you will need only hand tools STOP
START you will probably want to UNK someone to do the UNK , however STOP
START for larger UNK , you'll need some kind of power for UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START if you have a UNK of half an UNK or more you may want to buy a small garden UNK ( available for UNK to UNK with UNK , 1960 prices ) STOP
START these UNK are not entirely satisfactory for UNK , particularly on UNK soils , so you may still want to UNK someone to do the UNK STOP
START cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the UNK UNK STOP
START if you are going to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery UNK when you choose among farm enterprises STOP
START you can keep your machinery investment down by buying good UNK machinery , by sharing the cost and UNK of machinery with a UNK , and by UNK someone with machinery to do certain jobs STOP
START if an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed -- such as a spray UNK , a combine , or a UNK -- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work STOP
START selecting a farm STOP
START before you look for a farm you'll need to know ( 1 ) the kind and scale of farming you want to UNK ; ; STOP
START and ( 2 ) whether you want to buy or rent STOP
START information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in UNK on the kind and scale of your farming venture STOP
START if you are not well UNK with the area in which you wish to locate , or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming , usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy STOP
START discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm STOP
START location STOP
START UNK to work STOP
START -- STOP
START choose a location within easy UNK distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities STOP
START then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have to sell the farm STOP
START the presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable STOP
START obviously the farm should be on an UNK road STOP
START UNK to markets STOP
START -- STOP
START if you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby STOP
START if you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk , for example , you should be close to a town or city STOP
START kind of neighborhood STOP
START -- STOP
START look for a farm in a neighborhood of UNK homes STOP
START there are UNK in the country as well as in the city STOP
START few rural areas are protected by UNK STOP
START a UNK , filling station , UNK yard , UNK plant , or some other business may go up near enough to UNK your home or to UNK its value STOP
START facilities in the area STOP
START -- STOP
START check on the schools in the area , the quality of teaching , and the provision for transportation to and from them STOP
START find out whether fire protection , sewage system , gas , water UNK , and electrical lines are available in the UNK STOP
START if these facilities are not at the door , getting them may cost more than you expect STOP
START you may have to provide them yourself or get along without them STOP
START you cannot get along without an adequate supply of pure water STOP
START if you are considering a part-time farm where the water must be provided by a well , find out if there is a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one UNK STOP
START a pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden STOP
START pond water can be UNK for human use , but most part-time farmers would not want to go to so much trouble STOP
START the following amounts of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic uses STOP
START UNK and soil STOP
START is the land suited to the crops you UNK to raise ? ? STOP
START if you can't tell , get help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist STOP
START soil type , UNK , or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones STOP
START small areas that aren't right for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop STOP
START the house STOP
START will the house on any part-time farm you are considering make a satisfactory full-time residence ? ? STOP
START how much will it cost to do any necessary UNK and UNK ? ? STOP
START if the house is not UNK adequately for electricity or if UNK or a central heating system must be installed , check into the cost of making these improvements STOP
START buying a farm STOP
START the value of the farm to you will depend on -- STOP
START its worth as a place to live STOP

START and still another witness , one who had UNK out from under a UNK of UNK , had to tell how the UNK had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot STOP

START `` it is not an individual that is in the UNK at this historical trial '' -- said UNK UNK , `` and not the UNK UNK alone -- but anti-semitism throughout history '' STOP
START how could supplying eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could UNK in the murder of millions of jews without being an UNK contribute to a UNK against anti-semitism ? ? STOP
START and if it was not an individual who was in the UNK , why was the trial , as we shall observe later , all but UNK in the attempt to prove eichmann a `` UNK '' ? ? STOP
START these questions touch the root of confusion in the UNK case STOP
START it might be contended , of course , that eichmann in UNK UNK UNK feelings was lying or UNK on a private definition of anti-semitism STOP
START but in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case UNK by UNK UNK and set forth in the UNK STOP
START in such a case the UNK should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue by argument STOP
START one who could be linked to anti-semitism only by UNK his UNK is scarcely a good specimen of the UNK throughout the ages STOP
START UNK at eichmann though he might , the UNK could not establish that the UNK was UNK the way he felt about jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of anti-semitism STOP
START yes , he believed that the jews were `` enemies of the UNK '' , and such a belief is , of course , typical of `` UNK '' UNK ; ; STOP
START but he believed in the UNK in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a UNK UNK on the nature of things STOP
START the real question was how one passed from anti-semitism of this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-semitism itself STOP
START in regard to eichmann , it was to be found in the UNK outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-semitism , a principle by which the UNK of anti-semitism itself was made more UNK STOP
START perhaps under the guidance of this UNK principle one could , as eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the jews and still be their UNK STOP
START not through fear of UNK orders , as eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar UNK that began in a UNK of the UNK UNK contained in the UNK interpretation of history and grew with each of UNK UNK into a permanent UNK and sense of magical UNK that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more UNK the better , `` well , UNK try it '' STOP
START at any rate , the substance of UNK testimony was that all his actions UNK from his membership in the party and the UNK , and though the UNK did his UNK to prove actual personal UNK of jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the UNK lesson UNK to that extent STOP
START but if the trial did not UNK the special UNK UNK so deadly to jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it UNK very effectively against the ordinary anti-semitism of which the UNK made such effective use in germany and wherever else they could find it STOP
START if anti-semitism was on trial in UNK , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of UNK department of jewish affairs , as UNK by the UNK and murder of jews by UNK and UNK UNK in germany , as well as in poland , UNK , UNK ? ? STOP
START the UNK UNK conference called by UNK in january UNK , to UNK the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million jews spread throughout the nations of europe , was attended by representatives of major UNK of the german state , including the UNK minister of the interior , the state secretary in charge of the four year plan , the UNK minister of justice , the under secretary of foreign affairs STOP
START the measures for UNK proposed and accepted at the conference affected industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government STOP

START in other words , the UNK of the murder plan made clear that physically UNK the jews was but an extension of the UNK measures already operating in every phase of german life , and that the new UNK counted on the general anti-semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder STOP
START this , in fact , it turned out to be STOP
START since the magnitude of the plan made UNK impossible , once the UNK had began to turn , persons controlling german industries , social institutions , and armed forces became , through their anti-semitism or their UNK of it , conscious UNK of UNK UNK ; ; STOP

START what more could be asked for a trial intended to UNK the world against anti-semitism than this opportunity to UNK the exact UNK between the respectable UNK and the UNK UNK ? ? STOP
START not in UNK anti-semitism but in the anti-semitism of the UNK german man of affairs lay the potential warning of the trial STOP
START no doubt many of the citizens of the third UNK had conceived their anti-semitism as an `` innocent '' UNK of jews , as do others like them today STOP
START the final solution proved that the UNK of any variety UNK himself as being UNK in the UNK and UNK of others STOP
START ought not an UNK trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how representative types of `` mere '' UNK were drawn step by step into the program of UNK and UNK ? ? STOP
START the UNK in his opening remarks did refer to `` the UNK of anti-semitism '' among the germans which UNK `` UNK and transformed '' STOP
START but if there was evidence at the trial that aimed over UNK head at his UNK in the societies where he UNK , the press seems to have UNK it STOP
START nor did the trial UNK much attention to UNK the UNK of anti-semitism to the UNK , both in building their own power and in destroying that of UNK organizations and states STOP
START certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-semitism is to demonstrate its UNK as a dangerous weapon STOP
START eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the UNK can be used to UNK the ordinary man of present-day society into a UNK to all his neighbors STOP
START do UNK everywhere know enough about how the UNK of the jews in germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to UNK the UNK , UNK apart individuals and groups , UNK the UNK and most UNK UNK , UNK trust and personal dignity , and finally UNK people to follow their UNK into the UNK by making them UNK in UNK UNK ? ? STOP
START the career of eichmann made the trial a potential UNK for UNK UNK : UNK of being UNK for a jew , he UNK protection in his UNK uniform ; ; STOP
START UNK to the UNK idea , he is forced to overcome habits of UNK and UNK ; ; STOP
START once in power he begins to give UNK to a criminal UNK that causes him to UNK between UNK and UNK of those above him STOP
START `` is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? ? STOP
START the trial should have asked the nations STOP
START but though this UNK in no way UNK UNK guilt , the UNK , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of it STOP
START finally , if the mission of the trial was to UNK anti-semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the UNK UNK of the countries in which the final solution was UNK by native UNK -- i.e, germany , poland , UNK , UNK -- and those in which it met the UNK of human UNK -- UNK , UNK , italy , UNK , france ? ? STOP
START should not everyone have been UNK to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations UNK by anti-semitism proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their jewish UNK from the UNK ? ? STOP
START wasn't this meaning of UNK experience in various countries worth UNK ? ? STOP
START as the first collective UNK of the UNK UNK , the trial of eichmann represents a recovery of the jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be UNK by silence ) STOP
START only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin STOP
START it is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the trial of what had been done to the jews of europe STOP
START it is not that the facts of the UNK were UNK ; ; STOP
START most of the information UNK in UNK had been brought to the surface by the numerous war UNK UNK and UNK UNK , and by reports , UNK , and UNK accounts STOP
START in UNK , UNK , in 1952 , a roman catholic hospital presented seven protestant UNK with an UNK to UNK the planned UNK UNK or to UNK from the hospital staff STOP
START three agreed , but four UNK and were suspended STOP
START after a flood of UNK , they were UNK at the beginning of 1953 STOP
START the peace of the community was badly disturbed , and people across the nation , reading of the incident , felt uneasy STOP
START in new york city in 1958 , the UNK UNK of UNK refused to permit a UNK to provide a protestant mother with a UNK device STOP
START he thereby UNK a bitter controversy involving protestants , jews and roman catholics that continued for two months , until the UNK board of UNK UNK the UNK on UNK therapy STOP
START a year later in UNK , UNK a roman catholic hospital UNK an UNK UNK because of his connection with the planned UNK association STOP
START immediately , the religious groups of the city were UNK in an angry dispute over the UNK UNK of a man's right to freedom of religious belief and conscience STOP
START these UNK , typical of many others , UNK the UNK fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , UNK and UNK among religious groups in this country than the UNK issue STOP
START it has UNK up UNK on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over UNK regulations in municipal UNK and health and UNK agencies STOP
START it has UNK on the national level in the matter of including UNK information and material in foreign aid to UNK countries STOP
START where it is not actually UNK , it UNK and UNK in UNK UNK like a UNK , ready to UNK at any moment STOP
START the time has come for citizens of all UNK to UNK in an effort to remove this UNK and UNK issue from the political and social life of our nation STOP
START the first step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the UNK level STOP
START instead of emotional UNK , loaded phrases and UNK , we need a UNK study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached STOP
START `` all too frequently '' , points out james UNK , UNK editor of UNK , `` catholics run UNK over protestant UNK in this matter , by failure to consider the UNK behind the protestant position and , particularly , by their UNK at the fact that protestant opinion on birth control has changed in recent decades '' STOP
START all too often our language is UNK UNK STOP
START the second step is to recognize the substantial agreement -- frequently UNK by UNK and UNK newspaper reporting -- already existing between catholics and UNK concerning the over-all objectives of family planning STOP
START instead of UNK being obliged or even encouraged to UNK the greatest possible number of UNK , as many UNK imagine , the ideal of responsible UNK is stressed STOP
START family planning is encouraged , so that parents will be able to provide properly for their UNK STOP
START pope UNK 12 , declared in 1951 that it is possible to be UNK from the normal obligation of UNK for a long time and even for the whole UNK of married life , if there are serious reasons , such as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , UNK , economic and social `` indications '' STOP
START this means that such factors as the health of the parents , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life , the degree of population density of a country and the UNK of housing facilities may UNK be taken into consideration in determining the number of UNK STOP
START these are substantially the same factors considered by UNK in family planning STOP
START the laws of many states permit birth control only for medical reasons STOP
START the roman catholic church , however , UNK a much more liberal policy on family planning STOP
START catholics , protestants and jews are in agreement over the objectives of family planning , but UNK over the methods to be used STOP
START the roman catholic church UNK only UNK or the rhythm method , also known as the use of the UNK or safe period STOP
START the church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine author : it involves no UNK of UNK laws , but simply an UNK and UNK use of them STOP
START with the exception of the roman catholic and the orthodox catholic churches , most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical UNK , allowing the couple free choice STOP
START there is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement STOP
START the grounds for the UNK position are UNK ( old testament ) , the UNK of the fathers and doctors of the early church , the UNK tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest UNK authority and the natural law STOP
START the latter plays a prominent role in roman catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from UNK , in determining the ethical character of UNK methods STOP
START the roman catholic UNK tradition UNK as UNK that the primary objective purpose of the UNK act is UNK and that the UNK of the mutual love of the UNK is the secondary and subjective end STOP
START this conclusion is based on two UNK : that man by the use of his reason can UNK god's purpose in the universe and that god makes known his purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangements STOP
START thus , man can readily UNK that the primary objective end of the UNK act is UNK , the UNK of the race STOP
START moreover , man may not UNK or UNK the physical arrangements established by god , who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception STOP
START UNK that god is the author of this law and of all laws of nature , roman catholics believe that they are obliged to UNK those laws , not UNK or UNK them STOP
START let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between protestants and roman catholics appear to be UNK STOP
START but people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of UNK , without taking up arms against those who UNK with them STOP
START why is it so different in regard to birth control ? ? STOP
START it is because each side has sought to UNK its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief , or at least the practical consequences thereof , upon others STOP
START it is always a UNK for a religious organization , especially a powerful or dominant one , to UNK through the UNK UNK of the law its UNK viewpoint upon others STOP
START both roman catholics and protestants have UNK to this UNK in the past STOP
START consider what happened during world war 1 , , when the protestant churches united to push the UNK law through congress STOP
START many of them UNK believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is UNK evil and UNK STOP
START with over four million american men away at war , protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public STOP
START with the return of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens STOP
START the attempt to UNK that belief UNK in a UNK of UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK that led to a UNK of law UNK in our history STOP
START the so-called `` UNK experiment '' came to an UNK end STOP
START that UNK , painful and UNK experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society STOP
START that experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today STOP
START up to the turn of the century , UNK was condemned by all christian churches as UNK , UNK and contrary to divine law STOP
START this was generally reflected in the civil laws of christian countries STOP
START today , the roman catholic and orthodox churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction STOP
START the various UNK conferences , expressing the anglican viewpoint , mirror the gradual change that has taken place among protestants generally STOP
START in UNK , the UNK conference repeated its UNK UNK of UNK and issued `` an UNK warning against the use of UNK means for the UNK of conception , together with the grave UNK -- physical , moral , and religious -- thereby UNK , and against the UNK which the extension of such use UNK the race '' STOP
START UNK the view that the sexual union is an end in itself , the conference declared : `` we UNK UNK what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of christian marriage STOP
START one is the primary purpose for which marriage exists , namely , the UNK of the race through the gift and heritage of children ; ; STOP
START the other is the UNK importance in married life of UNK and UNK UNK '' STOP
START the conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of UNK STOP
START in UNK , the UNK conference again UNK the primary purpose of marriage to be the UNK of children , but UNK that , in certain limited circumstances , UNK might be UNK legitimate STOP
START in 1958 , the conference UNK birth control as the responsibility laid by god on parents everywhere STOP
START many other protestant denominations UNK the UNK in such action STOP
START in march , UNK , 22 out of UNK members of a committee of the federal council of churches UNK artificial methods of birth control STOP
START `` as to the necessity '' , the committee declared , `` for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the UNK of children , and consequently of control of conception , there can be no question STOP
START there is general agreement also that sex union between UNK and wives as an expression of mutual affection without relation to UNK is right '' STOP
START since then , many protestant denominations have made separate UNK , in which they not only approved birth control , but declared it at times to be a religious duty STOP
START what determines the morality , they state , is not the means used , but the motive in general , the means ( excluding UNK ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical STOP
START this development is reflected in the action taken in february , 1961 , by the general board of the national council of churches , the largest protestant organization in the aj STOP
START the board approved and UNK the use of UNK devices as a part of christian responsibility in family planning STOP
START it called for opposition to laws and UNK practices UNK the information or availability of UNK STOP
START the general board declared : `` most of the protestant churches hold UNK and UNK UNK to be UNK right when the motives are right STOP
START the general protestant conviction is that motives , rather than methods , form the primary moral issue , provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception '' STOP
START an action once UNK condemned by all christian churches and UNK by the civil law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of protestant denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty STOP
START this viewpoint has now been UNK into action by the majority of people in this country STOP
START repeated UNK have UNK that most married UNK are now using UNK in the practice of birth control STOP
START for all concerned with UNK legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the american people is clear , profound and UNK STOP
START to try to UNK the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative UNK would be to UNK the same UNK of law and order that was UNK by the UNK UNK experiment STOP
START this brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : they are moral judgments and matters of theological belief STOP
START conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : the civil law is concerned with public UNK STOP
START only confusion , failure and UNK result when the effort is made to UNK upon the civil authority the impossible task of UNK private homes to UNK the possibility of sin STOP
START among the chief UNK of such an UNK UNK would be religion itself STOP
START on april 17 , UNK , the UNK little UNK UNK , discovery , weighed UNK in UNK pool , london , and UNK down the UNK toward the sea STOP

START what disaster struck the discovery during those seventeen months ? ? STOP
START what happened to the fourteen UNK men ? ? STOP
START these questions have remained one of the great sea UNK of all time STOP
START for hundreds of years , the evidence available consisted of ( 1 ) the UNK UNK journal , ( 2 ) a highly UNK account by one of the UNK , ( 3 ) a note found in a dead man's desk on board , and ( 4 ) several UNK reports STOP
START all told , they offered a highly confused picture STOP
START but since 1927 , UNK UNK into ancient court records and legal UNK have been able to find UNK pieces of information STOP
START not enough to do away with all UNK , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage STOP
START historians have had two reasons for UNK so long in their investigations STOP
START first , they wanted to clarify a UNK , UNK UNK STOP
START second , they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain -- a man whose name is UNK UNK on our maps , on american towns and counties , on a great american river , and on half a million square miles of UNK UNK STOP
START the name : henry hudson STOP
START this is the story of his last tragic voyage , as nearly as we are able -- or ever , probably , will be able -- to determine : STOP
START the sailing in the spring of UNK was hudson's fourth in four years STOP
START each time his objective had been the same -- a direct water passage from western europe to the far east STOP
START in UNK and UNK , the english UNK company had sent him UNK to look for a route over the north UNK or across the top of russia STOP
START twice he had failed , and the UNK company indicated it would not back him again STOP
START in UNK , the UNK east india company hired hudson , gave him two learned UNK , UNK him out with a ship called the half moon , and supplied him with UNK UNK STOP
START this time he turned UNK , to the middle atlantic coast of north america STOP
START his chief discovery was important -- the great north ( later , the hudson ) river -- but it produced no northwest passage STOP
START when the half moon put in at dartmouth , england , in the fall of UNK , word of hudson's findings UNK out , and english interest in him UNK STOP
START the government UNK hudson to return to UNK with his ship STOP
START he UNK went to london and spent the winter talking to men of wealth STOP
START by UNK , he was supported by a rich merchant UNK under the UNK of henry , prince of UNK STOP
START he had obtained and UNK a veteran ship called the discovery and had UNK a crew of UNK , the largest he had ever UNK STOP
START the purpose of this fourth voyage was clear STOP
START a century of exploration had established that a great land mass , north and south america , lay between europe and the UNK STOP
START one by one , the UNK in the coast that promised a passage through had been UNK and UNK STOP
START in fact , hudson's UNK up the great north river had disposed of one of the last hopes STOP
START but there remained one mysterious , UNK gap , far to the north STOP
START nearly twenty-five years before , captain john davis had noted , as he UNK near the UNK circle , `` a very great UNK , the water UNK and UNK , as it were the meeting of UNK '' STOP
START he named this opening , between UNK island and UNK , the `` UNK UNK '' STOP
START ( later , it was to be called hudson UNK STOP
START ) STOP
START in UNK , george UNK , in the same little discovery that hudson now UNK , had UNK 300 miles up the UNK before his UNK men turned the ship back STOP
START hudson now proposed to UNK all the way through and test the UNK beyond for the UNK UNK STOP
START even hudson , experienced in UNK sailing and determined as he was , must have had UNK as he UNK down the UNK STOP
START ahead were UNK , UNK waters STOP
START on previous UNK , it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain STOP
START on the second voyage , he had turned back at the frozen island of UNK UNK and UNK given the crew a UNK stating that he did so of his own free will -- which was obviously not the case STOP
START on the third voyage , a UNK rising from a quarrel between UNK and english crew members on the half moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to UNK in UNK STOP
START worse , his present crew included five men who had UNK with him before STOP
START of only one could he be sure -- young john hudson , his second son STOP
START the mate , robert UNK , who had kept the journal on the half moon , was experienced -- but he was a bitter old man , ready to UNK or desert at any opportunity STOP
START UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , was a good worker , but UNK independent STOP
START UNK UNK and UNK UNK were like the rest -- UNK , ready to UNK against hudson in a crisis STOP
START but men willing to UNK at all into waters where wooden ships could be UNK like eggs were hard to find STOP
START hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an UNK STOP
START and he refused to be anything else STOP
START it is believed that hudson was related to other UNK men of the UNK company and was trained on company ships STOP
START he was a UNK , married , with three sons STOP
START ( the common UNK that he was UNK and that his first name was UNK stem from UNK documents of his third voyage STOP
START ) in UNK , hudson was probably in his early UNK , a good UNK , a UNK UNK , but otherwise UNK UNK to his chosen profession STOP
START hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the UNK STOP
START there at the UNK edge waited one henry greene , whom hudson listed as a `` UNK '' STOP
START greene was in UNK a young UNK from UNK , who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred -- UNK , UNK and UNK STOP
START he was not the sort of UNK hudson wanted his UNK to see on board and he had greene wait at UNK , where the discovery picked him up STOP
START for the first three weeks , the ship UNK up the east coast of great britain , then turned UNK STOP
START on may 11 , she reached UNK STOP
START poor UNK and UNK locked her up in a harbor the crew called `` UNK bay '' STOP
START the subsequent UNK wait made the crew UNK STOP
START with hudson looking on , his UNK greene picked a fight with the UNK UNK , edward wilson STOP
START the issue was settled on shore , greene winning and wilson remaining UNK , determined to catch the next fishing boat back to england STOP
START with difficulty , hudson persuaded him to UNK the ship , and they UNK from UNK STOP
START early in june , the discovery passed `` UNK '' ( southern UNK ) and in UNK entered the `` UNK UNK '' STOP
START UNK ice bore down from the north and west STOP
START UNK hung over the route constantly STOP
START UNK UNK rose as much as fifty feet STOP
START the UNK compass was UNK because of the UNK of the magnetic north UNK STOP
START as the UNK grew larger , hudson was forced to turn south into what is now UNK bay , an UNK of the great UNK STOP
START after finding that its UNK led nowhere , however , he turned north again , toward the main , UNK UNK -- and the crew , at first uneasy , then UNK , UNK STOP
START the trouble was at least partly UNK doing STOP
START for weeks he had been saying that hudson's idea of sailing through to UNK was absurd STOP
START the great , UNK ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason STOP
START a group of UNK announced to hudson that they would UNK no farther STOP
START instead of UNK the UNK , as many UNK of the era would have done ( sir UNK UNK UNK a man's head off under similar circumstances ) , hudson decided to be reasonable STOP
START he went to his UNK and emerged carrying a large chart , which he set up in view of the crew STOP

START the popularity of folklore in america stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in america STOP
START and the emphasis on nationalism in america is in proportion to the growth of american influence across the world STOP
START thus , if we are to observe american folklore in the twentieth century , we will do well to establish the relationships between folklore , nationalism and UNK at the UNK STOP
START historians have come to recognize two UNK facts concerning nationalism and international influence STOP
START 1 ) every age UNK the events of its history in terms of what should have been , creating UNK about itself that UNK contemporary beliefs and UNK contemporary actions STOP
START what actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred STOP
START 2 ) as a country UNK its cultural and political attitudes on others , it UNK its heritage in hopes of UNK its UNK STOP
START its folklore and legend , usually UNK as history , are allowed to account for group actions , to provide a UNK point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification STOP
START one can apply these facts to britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her UNK over palm and UNK , and they can be applied again to the united states in more recent years STOP
START the popularity of local color literature before the UNK war , the steady UNK of the lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier west in our mass UNK are cases in point STOP
START nor is it an accident that baseball , growing into the national game in the last 75 years , has become a UNK of american life , that learned societies such as the american folklore society and the american historical association were founded in the UNK , or that courses in american literature , american civilization , american anything have swept our school and college UNK STOP
START of course , nationalism has really UNK its UNK in a country as UNK as ours , and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture UNK of the UNK united states STOP
START yet nationalism has lost few of its UNK for the historian , writer or man in the street STOP
START it is an UNK UNK that most american history and most american literature is today written from an essentially UNK and UNK point of view at the very time america is UNK her UNK over palm and UNK STOP
START after all , the average american as he lies and UNK for the enemy in UNK or as she UNK the newspaper in some UNK hope of personal contact with the front is UNK that his or her UNK is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal UNK UNK and control STOP
START UNK identification with an international struggle , whether UNK or peaceful , requires absurd UNK and intense emotional involvement STOP
START such identification comes for each group in each crisis by UNK history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes STOP
START in america , such UNK has served a particularly useful purpose STOP
START a UNK people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political UNK in a new and UNK land STOP
START but we must never forget , most of the appropriate heroes and their UNK were created overnight , to answer immediate needs , almost always with conscious aims and ends STOP
START UNK UNK george washington became the symbol of UNK and the father image of the UNK states STOP
START UNK lincoln emerged as an UNK of the national constitution STOP
START robert UNK represented the dignity needed by a UNK UNK STOP
START and their roles are UNK by those of UNK henry , UNK UNK , UNK jackson , UNK UNK , UNK roosevelt and many , many more STOP
START therefore , the UNK , as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years , will be UNK of two facts STOP
START 1 ) most of the UNK that are created to UNK the UNK of UNK are essentially UNK and are not folk UNK at all STOP
START 2 ) the concept that an `` american national folklore '' exists is itself probably another UNK legend STOP
START folklore is individually created art that a UNK group of people preserve , vary and UNK through oral transmission STOP
START it has come to mean UNK , UNK , tales , songs , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK and such literary forms of expression STOP
START related to written literature , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form , it UNK its UNK when UNK or removed from its oral existence STOP
START though it may exist in either UNK or UNK societies , it UNK a role of true cultural importance only in the latter STOP
START in its UNK and commercial UNK to discover our folk heritage , the public has remained UNK of UNK such as this STOP
START UNK , americans have swept UNK and UNK materials like paul UNK tales , UNK lincoln UNK and labor union songs up as true products of our american oral tradition STOP
START nor have we remembered that in the melting UNK of america the hundreds of isolated and UNK UNK , regional and occupational groups did not UNK into a UNK national unit until long after education and UNK had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying UNK significant material STOP
START naturally , such UNK facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or UNK UNK by means of folklore STOP
START that much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully UNK among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is UNK STOP
START as long as his material is UNK , can in some way be UNK to the masses and appears `` democratic '' to his audience , he remains satisfied STOP
START from all this we can now see that two UNK of development run through the history of UNK american folklore STOP
START on the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in UNK methods of research , who have sought out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the UNK , regional and occupational groups that make up this nation STOP
START on the other we have the UNK and the national UNK who have been willing to use any UNK , `` frontier western '' or colonial material UNK STOP
START unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , UNK and musicians ) who have used american folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two UNK even in the most general of ways STOP
START after all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to american UNK STOP
START in addition , this country has been settled by many peoples of many UNK and their UNK has become UNK slowly , in an age of UNK and easy communication , within an UNK and changing society STOP
START the problems UNK even the experts STOP
START for that matter , the experts themselves are a mixed breed STOP
START UNK , UNK , historians and such by profession , they approach their discipline as UNK , UNK , commercial UNK , UNK or some combination of the four STOP
START they have widely varying UNK and aims STOP
START they have little `` UNK de corps '' STOP
START the outlook for the amateur , for instance , is usually dependent on his UNK for local history or for the UNK STOP
START his love of folklore has UNK in it , and he doesn't care much about the UNK or the UNK STOP
START folklore is his UNK , and he , all too UNK , wishes it to remain as such STOP
START the amateur is closely related to the UNK , who is actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field STOP
START the UNK UNK the contact with rural life ; ; STOP
START he UNK folklore for the very `` field and stream '' reasons that many persons UNK game ; ; STOP
START and only rarely is he UNK concerned with the meaning of what he has located STOP
START UNK , both these types , the amateur and the UNK , are UNK and many of them don't distinguish well between real folklore and UNK material STOP
START but there are also the commercial UNK and the UNK -- one dominated by money , the other by nineteenth-century german scholarship STOP
START both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the UNK has found STOP
START both UNK at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage system and the electric light lines STOP
START the commercial UNK , who can't afford to be critical , gets along well with the amateur , from whom he UNK , but he frequently steps on the UNK UNK by UNK to keep his material genuine STOP
START his standards are , of course , completely foreign to those of the UNK STOP
START to both the amateur and the commercial UNK the UNK UNK a soul , UNK appreciation with his UNK UNK and UNK STOP
START dominated by the UNK circle of the university promotion system , the UNK looks down on and gets along UNK with the other three groups , although he cannot deny his UNK to the UNK STOP
START the knowledge that most americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial UNK and a few UNK UNK and UNK STOP
START the work done by the UNK , the men who really know what folklore is all about , has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a limited , learned audience STOP
START UNK want books that will sell , recording UNK want UNK that will not seem strange to ears used to UNK and jazz music , grade and high schools want UNK , but moral , material STOP
START the UNK is apt to be too honest to fit in STOP
START as a result , most people don't have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is ; ; STOP
START they see it as a UNK of UNK , moral UNK and UNK UNK , with a UNK or remedy thrown in here and there STOP
START and so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the UNK that even at the college level most of the UNK folklore courses given in the united states survive on sentiment and nationalism alone STOP
START if one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work , the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this UNK american public STOP
START and while every writer must be dealt with as a special case , the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions about each STOP
START does the writer know the difference between an `` UNK '' UNK or tall UNK and a true product of the folk ? ? STOP
START when the writer uses material does he UNK with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure ? ? STOP
START is the writer UNK ? ? STOP
START is he swept away by sentiment and UNK for an america that was ? ? STOP
START or does he UNK want to tap the real springs of american attitude and culture regardless of how UNK and UNK they may be ? ? STOP
START when he gets the answers to his questions he will be discouraged STOP
START in the first place , a good many writers who are said to use folklore , do not , unless one counts an occasional UNK or UNK STOP
START robert UNK , for instance , writes about rural life in new england , but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems STOP
START this has not , however , prevented UNK from UNK him a `` folk poet '' , simply because he is a rural one STOP
START in the second place , a large number of writers , making a more direct claim than UNK to being `` folk writers '' of one sort or another , clearly make no distinctions between genuine and UNK material STOP
START UNK vincent UNK john brown's body comes immediately to mind in this connection , as does john UNK the UNK of UNK and carl UNK the people , yes STOP
START the last two writers UNK strong political UNK into their works , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a UNK of protest by a UNK and UNK UNK mass STOP
START folklore , as used by such writers , really reflects images UNK into it by the very person using it STOP
START the folk are simply not UNK with respect to nation or political attitude STOP
START in fact , there is much evidence to indicate they don't care a bit about anything beyond their particular regional , UNK and occupational limits STOP
START nevertheless , with a reading public that UNK for the `` good old days '' and with an awareness of our expanding international interests , it is easy for the UNK to obtain a UNK position in literature by use of all UNK of UNK , real or UNK , and it is easy for the UNK and UNK to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk STOP
START as part of the same arrangement , torrio had , in the spirit of peace and good will , and in exchange for armed support in the april election campaign , UNK upon o'banion a third share in the UNK smoke shop UNK and a cut in the UNK beer trade STOP
START the UNK was to prove UNK STOP
START o'banion was a complex and UNK man , whose bright blue eyes UNK with a kind of frozen UNK into UNK STOP
START he had a round , frank irish face , UNK in a UNK UNK that stayed UNK in place even when he was UNK bullets into UNK body STOP
START he carried three guns -- one in the right UNK UNK , one under his left UNK , one in the left outside coat UNK -- and was equally UNK with both hands STOP
START he killed accurately , freely , and UNK STOP
START the police UNK him with twenty-five UNK but he was never brought to trial for one of them STOP
START like a fair number of UNK he UNK UNK STOP
START he was an expert UNK , UNK UNK in the arrangement of UNK and UNK STOP
START he had no apparent UNK of morality ; ; STOP
START he divided humanity into `` right UNK '' and `` wrong UNK '' , and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and UNK under STOP
START he had what was described by a UNK as a `` UNK UNK '' STOP
START he walked with a heavy list to the right , as that leg was four inches shorter than the other , but the UNK did not reduce his UNK UNK with his guns STOP
START UNK thought him `` just a superior sort of UNK '' but he was , in fact , with his UNK and UNK , and UNK UNK to UNK or UNK pain , a UNK UNK STOP
START he was also at this time , although not so UNK in high politics and the UNK as torrio and UNK , the most powerful and most dangerous UNK leader in the chicago UNK , the UNK king STOP
START o'banion was born in UNK , the son of an UNK irish UNK , in the north UNK little hell , close by the UNK quarter and death corner STOP
START he had been a UNK boy at the holy name UNK and also served as an UNK to father UNK STOP
START the influence of mass was less UNK than that of the UNK , UNK UNK among the UNK houses , UNK , and UNK UNK of his UNK ; ; STOP
START he ran wild with the child UNK of the UNK , and went through the normal UNK course of UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START at the age of ten , when he was working as a UNK in the loop , he was knocked down by a UNK which resulted in his UNK UNK leg STOP
START because of this he was known as UNK ( but , as with UNK and his UNK of UNK , never in his presence ) STOP
START in his UNK o'banion was UNK in the UNK market street UNK and he became a singing UNK in UNK UNK , a UNK low and UNK UNK in north clark street , where UNK customers were UNK UNK of their money by the singing UNK before being thrown out STOP
START he then got a job with the chicago UNK as a UNK UNK , a rough UNK employed to see that his UNK news UNK were not UNK upon by UNK UNK STOP
START he was also at the same time UNK practical experience as a safe UNK and UNK , and learning how to shoot to kill from a UNK UNK UNK named UNK UNK , later committed to UNK UNK as a UNK UNK , but whose eyes UNK with tears when the young UNK UNK a UNK about an irish mother in his clear and UNK UNK STOP
START UNK first conflict with the police came in UNK , at seventeen , when he was committed to UNK prison for three months for UNK ; ; STOP
START two years later he served another three months for assault STOP
START those were his only UNK behind bars , although he collected four more charges on his police record in UNK and UNK , three for UNK and one for UNK STOP
START but by now UNK political pull was beginning to be effective STOP
START on the occasion of his UNK UNK the UNK bond was furnished by an UNK , and the charge was UNK UNK STOP
START on one of his UNK UNK he was actually come upon by a detective sergeant john UNK down on his knees with a tool UNK in a UNK office safe in the UNK telegraph building ; ; STOP
START the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was UNK , at a cost of UNK in UNK , it was estimated STOP
START as promptly as torrio , o'banion UNK into UNK STOP
START he conducted it with less UNK and more spontaneous violence than the UNK , but he had his huge north side portion to UNK and he made a great deal of money STOP
START unlike the UNK , he UNK conducted UNK , UNK , and UNK UNK , and refused to touch UNK STOP
START he was also personally active in UNK politics , and by UNK o'banion had acquired sufficient political might to be able to state : `` i always deliver my UNK as per requirements '' STOP
START but whose requirements ? ? STOP
START until UNK o'banion UNK and UNK UNK had kept his north side UNK UNK democratic STOP
START there was a UNK UNK that went around at that time : UNK UNK carry the UNK and UNK UNK '' ? ? STOP
START UNK , in his UNK UNK '' STOP
START but as november UNK drew close the democratic UNK was UNK troubled by UNK reports that o'banion was being UNK by the opposition , and was meeting and UNK with important UNK STOP
START to UNK any change of UNK , the democrats UNK UNK a UNK UNK for o'banion , as public UNK for his past services and as a UNK of where his UNK lay STOP
START the reception was held in a private dining room of the UNK hotel on lincoln park west STOP
START it was an interesting UNK of UNK , union UNK , UNK UNK , UNK officials , and UNK STOP
START the guest list is in itself a little UNK of the state of american UNK life at this time STOP
START it included the top o'banion men and chief of UNK UNK UNK STOP
START when UNK UNK heard of the UNK he UNK UNK for an explanation of why he had been UNK the police department by UNK with these UNK and UNK STOP
START UNK said that he had understood the party was to be in UNK of UNK UNK , the UNK of a loop UNK house STOP
START `` but when i arrived and UNK a number of UNK characters i had thrown into the detective bureau basement half a dozen times , i knew i had been UNK , and UNK almost at once '' STOP
START in fact , UNK was UNK during the UNK with the presentation of a UNK UNK UNK STOP
START there was a brief UNK while one of UNK men UNK out both his guns and threatened to shoot a UNK who was UNK him for a tip STOP
START then o'banion was presented with a UNK watch set with UNK and UNK STOP
START this dinner was the start of a new UNK in the relationship between the UNK and the UNK , which , prior to UNK , says UNK , `` had been maintained with more or less UNK '' , but which UNK was marked by these UNK UNK , UNK by a UNK as `` UNK UNK '' , at which `` UNK UNK UNK by UNK with UNK , openly , in the big downtown UNK '' STOP
START UNK continued : `` they became an institution of the chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial UNK of the municipal and county governments in UNK '' STOP
START however , this UNK UNK did its UNK no good whatever STOP
START o'banion accepted his UNK watch and the UNK to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better republican deal STOP
START on election day -- november 4 -- he UNK UNK his force of UNK men , UNK , and experts in UNK repeat UNK STOP
START the result was a UNK for the republican candidates STOP
START this further demonstration of UNK UNK power did not please torrio and UNK STOP
START in the past year there had been too many examples of his UNK UNK and UNK for their UNK STOP
START he UNK publicly with a UNK , UNK UNK that UNK their UNK latin minds , and UNK towards them personally with an UNK UNK that UNK them beneath their UNK STOP
START they were disturbed by his UNK UNK -- as , when his UNK , UNK UNK , complained that he had been UNK by UNK miller , a UNK UNK , UNK of a jewish UNK and one of four brothers of tough reputation , who were UNK , a UNK in loose UNK league with torrio and o'banion , frank , a UNK , and UNK , the UNK STOP
START to settle this slight , o'banion went down to the la UNK theatre in the loop , where , he had learned , UNK miller was attending the opening of a musical UNK STOP
START at the end of the performance , UNK and UNK came out into the UNK UNK UNK among a UNK of UNK and UNK first UNK STOP
START o'banion drew his guns and fired at UNK , severely UNK him in the UNK STOP

START o'banion UNK away his gun and walked out of the theatre ; ; STOP
START he was neither UNK nor even UNK STOP
START that sort of UNK , for that sort of reason , in the view of torrio and UNK , was a UNK STOP
START a further example of the UNK difference in UNK was when two UNK held up a torrio beer UNK on a west side street and demanded UNK to let it through STOP
START one of the UNK UNK o'banion -- on a line UNK by the detective bureau -- and reported the situation STOP
START UNK reaction was : `` three hundred dollars ! ! STOP
START to them UNK ? ? STOP
START why , i can get them knocked off for half that much '' STOP
START upon which the detective bureau UNK rifle UNK to prevent trouble if o'banion should send his UNK out to deal with the UNK UNK STOP
START but in the UNK the UNK , unhappy with this solution , UNK torrio and returned to o'banion with the message : `` say , UNK , i just been talking to johnny , and he said to let them UNK have the three hundred STOP
START he says he don't want no trouble '' STOP
START but torrio and UNK had UNK cause to hate and UNK the UNK STOP
START for three years , since the liquor territorial conference , torrio had , with his UNK patience , and because he knew that UNK could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business , UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP
START they had suffered , in UNK silence , the sight of his sharp practice in UNK STOP
START when , as a diplomatic gesture of UNK and in payment for the loan of UNK in the april election , torrio had given o'banion a UNK of UNK , the profits from that district had been UNK a month STOP
START in six months o'banion had UNK the profits to UNK a month -- mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty chicago UNK UNK to shift out to the UNK STOP
START these UNK customers had until then been buying their supplies from the UNK , UNK , and UNK UNK , and now they were UNK for trade with the UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START once again UNK UNK UNK had caused a UNK of ill will STOP
START the revenue from UNK UNK territory went up still higher , until the yield was more than the UNK UNK from the far bigger trade area of UNK south and west sides STOP
START but he still showed no intention of sharing with the UNK STOP
START at last , even the controlled torrio was unable to hold still , and he UNK suggested that o'banion should take a percentage in the UNK UNK in return for one from his UNK beer UNK STOP
START UNK UNK was a UNK UNK and a flat refusal STOP
START still more UNK UNK was UNK by the o'banion UNK UNK from a west side UNK yard of a UNK load of UNK UNK worth UNK and by one of the UNK UNK of the UNK era -- the UNK UNK UNK , which became famous for the cool UNK of the operation STOP
START here was stored UNK worth of UNK UNK STOP
START these UNK cases were UNK off in a UNK operation by the o'banion men , who left in their UNK the same number of UNK filled with water STOP
START a tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide , an UNK or a UNK UNK STOP
START the most UNK of all was launched by the UNK of the island of UNK in UNK ; ; STOP

START whether or not plato's UNK of the lost UNK of UNK is true , UNK UNK that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times STOP
START indeed , a UNK destructive tsunami that UNK in the UNK sea in 1945 has even UNK the interest of UNK and UNK in the UNK story of the flood STOP
START one of the most UNK tsunami on record followed the famous UNK UNK of november 1 , UNK ; ; STOP
START its waves UNK for a week and were felt as far away as the english coast STOP
START tsunami are rare , however , in the atlantic ocean ; ; STOP
START they are far more common in the pacific STOP
START japan has had 15 destructive ones ( eight of them UNK ) since UNK STOP

START in UNK an UNK in japan UNK waves so huge that they UNK into the UNK sea ; ; STOP
START one wave UNK more than UNK ships and boats in UNK bay STOP
START a tsunami in the UNK islands in UNK washed away an entire town ( UNK ) , leaving only two UNK trees standing where the community had been STOP
START in UNK a japanese tsunami killed UNK people and swept away 10,000 homes STOP
START the dimensions of these waves UNK all our usual standards of measurement STOP
START an ordinary sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from UNK to UNK -- no longer than UNK feet in the atlantic or UNK feet in the pacific STOP
START but a tsunami often UNK more than 100 miles and sometimes as much as UNK miles from UNK to UNK STOP
START while a wind wave never UNK at more than 60 miles per hour , the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be UNK in hundreds of miles per hour STOP
START the greater the depth of the water , the greater is the speed of the wave ; ; STOP
START UNK law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due to UNK STOP
START in the deep waters of the pacific these waves reach a speed of UNK miles per hour STOP
START tsunami are so UNK in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly UNK STOP
START their UNK sometimes is as little as two feet from UNK to UNK STOP
START usually it is only when they approach UNK water on the shore that they build up to their UNK heights STOP
START on the UNK day in UNK when the great waves approached japan , UNK at sea noticed no unusual UNK STOP
START not until they UNK home at the end of the day , through a sea UNK with bodies and the UNK of houses , were they aware of what had happened STOP
START the seemingly quiet ocean had UNK a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches UNK with UNK , UNK thousands of them and UNK villages along the shore STOP
START the UNK waves are more dangerous on flat UNK than on UNK ones STOP
START they usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height , but when they UNK into a UNK UNK or harbor they may rise to UNK proportions STOP
START generally the first UNK of a tsunami is a rather sharp UNK , not different enough from an ordinary wave to UNK UNK observers STOP
START this is followed by a tremendous UNK of water away from the shore as the first great UNK UNK STOP
START UNK are left high and dry , and the beaches are covered with UNK fish STOP
START at UNK large numbers of people ran out to UNK the amazing UNK of the UNK beach STOP
START many of them paid for their UNK with their lives , for some minutes later the first UNK wave UNK over the shore STOP
START after an UNK in japan in UNK people on the coast at UNK were so UNK by the extraordinary UNK of the sea that they UNK to higher ground STOP
START when a second UNK came , they UNK back to the beach , UNK that they might be UNK under UNK STOP
START just as they reached the shore , the first huge wave UNK upon them STOP
START a tsunami is not a single wave but a series STOP
START the waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an hour or more ( because of their great length ) , and this has often UNK people into thinking after the first great wave has UNK that it is all over STOP
START the waves may keep coming for many hours STOP
START usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the UNK STOP
START among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at UNK was UNK UNK of the UNK institution of UNK , one of the world's UNK marine UNK STOP
START he was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves STOP
START their UNK and UNK , he reported , was accompanied by a great UNK , UNK and UNK STOP
START the third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest STOP
START on some of the UNK beaches the waves came in gently ; ; STOP
START they were UNK on the UNK facing the direction of the UNK from which the waves had come STOP
START in UNK bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high STOP
START the highest waves , UNK feet , occurred at UNK valley STOP
START scientists and UNK have occasionally seen strange UNK of the phenomenon STOP
START during a UNK tsunami in japan the sea UNK UNK at night STOP
START the UNK of the water is now believed to have been caused by the UNK of vast numbers of the UNK UNK UNK UNK by the UNK of the sea STOP
START japanese UNK have sometimes observed that UNK UNK up in their UNK during a tsunami have UNK UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START the fish have UNK vast numbers of UNK UNK , raised to the surface by the UNK STOP
START the waves of a UNK tsunami in UNK bay brought to the surface and UNK to death huge numbers of UNK that normally live at a depth of UNK feet STOP
START UNK UNK UNK them in by the thousands STOP
START the UNK system developed since the 1946 disaster in hawaii UNK mainly on a simple and UNK instrument devised by commander UNK of the coast and UNK survey staff STOP
START it consists of a series of UNK and a UNK chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface STOP
START ordinary water UNK are UNK STOP
START but when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean , they set in motion a corresponding UNK in a column of UNK which UNK an electric circuit STOP
START this in turn sets off an UNK , UNK the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress STOP
START such equipment has been installed at UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK harbor STOP
START the moment the UNK goes off , information is immediately UNK to UNK , which is the center of the warning system STOP
START this center also receives UNK reports on UNK from four coast survey stations in the pacific which are equipped with UNK STOP
START its staff makes a preliminary determination of the UNK of the UNK and UNK UNK stations near the UNK for a tsunami STOP
START by means of UNK showing UNK times and depths in the ocean at various locations , it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival at hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the pacific STOP
START the civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger , and they issue UNK and take all necessary UNK steps STOP
START all of these activities are UNK to a UNK communication system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work UNK STOP
START since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the pacific , but only one was of any consequence STOP
START on november 4 , 1952 , an UNK occurred under the sea off the UNK UNK STOP
START at UNK that afternoon ( UNK time ) the shock was recorded by the UNK UNK in UNK STOP
START the warning system immediately went into action STOP
START within about an hour with the help of reports from UNK stations in alaska , UNK and california , the UNK UNK was placed at UNK degrees north UNK and UNK degrees east UNK STOP
START while accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the pacific ( UNK reported it was covered with nine feet of water ) , the UNK station made its UNK and UNK the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at UNK at UNK UNK time STOP
START it turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946 STOP
START they UNK a UNK UNK against a UNK in UNK harbor , knocked down telephone lines , UNK automobiles , UNK UNK , killed six cows STOP
START but not a single human life was lost , and property damage in the UNK islands did not exceed UNK STOP
START there is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage STOP
START but it is plain that a warning system , however efficient , is not enough STOP
START in the UNK areas of the pacific there should be restrictions against building homes on exposed UNK , or at least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or UNK strongly against waves STOP
START the key to the world of UNK is change ; ; STOP
START nothing remains the same STOP
START life has UNK from simple combinations of UNK in the sea to complex combinations in man STOP
START the land , too , is changing , and UNK are daily UNK of this STOP
START UNK result when movements in the earth twist UNK until they break STOP
START sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground surface ; ; STOP
START often the shifts cannot be seen , but they are there ; ; STOP
START and everywhere can be found UNK of earlier UNK once deeply UNK STOP
START today's UNK are most numerous in UNK where the earth's UNK is presently concentrated , but UNK of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them STOP
START the effects of UNK on civilization have been widely UNK , even UNK STOP
START the role of an UNK in starting the destruction of whole cities is UNK UNK , but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster STOP
START UNK has often UNK with fact to color reports STOP
START we have learned from UNK much of what we now know about the earth's interior , for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled STOP
START these waves have shown that UNK miles below the surface a liquid core begins , and that it , in turn , has a solid inner core STOP
START UNK UNK as far as 400 miles below the surface , but they do not occur at greater depths STOP
START two UNK UNK are based on these facts STOP
START ( 1 ) as far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to UNK forces by UNK flow rather than by breaking , as rigid surface UNK do STOP
START ( 2 ) if UNK do occur at such depths , why not deeper ? ? STOP
START knowledge gained from studying UNK waves has been applied in various fields STOP
START in the search for oil and gas , we make similar waves under controlled conditions with UNK and learn from them where there are UNK rock structures favorable to the UNK of these resources STOP
START we have also developed techniques for UNK and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the ground which they UNK STOP
START the following discussion of this subject has been adapted from the book causes of UNK by UNK UNK STOP

START at twelve minutes after five on the morning of UNK , april 18 , UNK , san francisco was UNK by a severe UNK STOP
START a sharp UNK was followed by a UNK roll STOP
START in UNK county UNK , near the river UNK , there is a quiet little UNK by the name of garryowen , which means `` garden of UNK '' STOP
START undoubtedly none of the UNK realize the influence their town has had on american military history , or the UNK of UNK that have been done in its name STOP
START the cry `` garryowen '' ! ! STOP
START UNK from the UNK of a UNK cavalry UNK was the last sound heard on this earth by UNK numbers of UNK , UNK and UNK , mexican UNK under UNK UNK , japanese in the south pacific , and chinese and north UNK communists in UNK STOP
START garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th UNK regiment , `` the fighting seventh '' STOP
START today a battle cry may seem an UNK , for in the modern army , UNK de corps has been UNK to UNK UNK and tables STOP
START but don't tell that to a veteran of the fighting seventh , especially in a UNK on UNK night STOP
START of all the thousands of men who have served in the 7th UNK , perhaps no one knows its spirit better than lieutenant colonel UNK UNK STOP
START UNK and UNK , with steel blue eyes and a chest UNK with UNK , chandler is the UNK of the UNK UNK STOP
START the truth is , however , that when UNK chandler first reported to the regiment the only UNK he had ever UNK was a UNK chair and the only weapon he had ever UNK was a pencil STOP
START chandler had been UNK in the medical service corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the kansas city medical depot when he decided that if he was going to make the army his career , he wanted to be in the fighting part of it STOP
START though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk officer , he managed to get transferred to the combat forces STOP
START the next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as UNK officer of troop h , 7th cavalry , in the middle of corps UNK in japan STOP
START outside of combat , he couldn't have UNK in a UNK spot STOP
START first of all , no unit likes to have a new UNK brought in from the outside , especially when he's an UNK UNK STOP
START second , if there is ever a perfect time to pull the UNK out from under him , it's on UNK STOP
START in combat , helping your UNK make a UNK of himself might mean getting yourself killed STOP
START but in UNK , with the top UNK watching him all the time , it's easy STOP
START chandler understood this and expected the worst STOP
START but his first few days with troop h were full of UNK , beginning with first sergeant robert early STOP
START chandler had expected a tough old UNK with a UNK voice STOP
START instead sergeant early was quiet , sharp and UNK STOP
START he had UNK in the army straight out of high school and had immediately set about learning his new trade STOP
START there was no weapon early could not take apart and UNK UNK STOP
START he could lead a UNK and he knew his paper work STOP
START further , he had taken full advantage of the UNK correspondence courses STOP
START he not only knew UNK , but mathematics , history and literature as well STOP
START but for all his UNK confidence , sergeant early was right out of the garryowen mold STOP
START he was filled with the spirit of the fighting seventh STOP
START that saved UNK chandler STOP
START sergeant early let the new UNK know just how UNK he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the united states army STOP
START he fed the captain UNK of history about the troops and the regiment STOP
START for example , it was a UNK of the 7th cavalry under colonel george UNK UNK that had been UNK out at the battle of the little big horn STOP
START it didn't take captain chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulders as commander of troop aj STOP
START but what made the load UNK was the realization that every officer , UNK and UNK was ready and willing to help him carry it , for the good of the troop and the regiment STOP
START UNK over , the 7th returned to UNK duty in UNK , captain chandler still with them STOP
START it was the 7th cavalry whose UNK were charged with UNK the UNK palace of the emperor STOP
START but still UNK chandler was not completely convinced that men would really die for a UNK word , `` garryowen '' STOP
START the final proof was a small incident STOP
START it happened at the UNK day party , a big affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for over UNK of a century to the UNK of an irish march STOP
START in the middle of the party chandler looked up to see four UNK faces bearing down upon him , each UNK above the UNK , UNK UNK he had ever seen STOP
START the faces UNK to lieutenant UNK UNK , his wife and their two children STOP
START and when the singing began , it was the UNK who UNK the old irish songs the best STOP
START though there was an occasional UNK UNK about UNK UNK , the jewish officer from chicago , singing UNK about the UNK UNK , no one really thought it was strange STOP
START for UNK UNK , like UNK UNK , the UNK boy who carried UNK last message , or UNK UNK , the UNK army on UNK , was a garryowen , through and through STOP
START it was no UNK that UNK was one of the most beloved UNK leaders in the regiment STOP
START and so UNK chandler got the spirit of garryowen STOP
START he set out to keep troop h the best troop in the best regiment STOP
START one of his UNK was to see to it that every man -- cook and UNK as well as UNK -- qualified with every weapon in the troop STOP
START even the UNK sergeant , bill brown , a UNK , UNK transfer from an UNK division , went out on the range STOP
START the troop received a new leader , lieutenant robert UNK , fresh out of UNK and UNK for regular army status STOP
START UNK was sharp and military , but he was up against tough competition for that UNK UNK , and he wanted to play it cool STOP
START so UNK chandler set out to sell him on the spirit of garryowen , just as he himself had been sold a short time before STOP
START when the UNK war began , on june 25 , 1950 , the anniversary of the day UNK had gone down fighting at the little big horn and the day the regiment had UNK the UNK of UNK during world war 2 , , the 7th cavalry was not in the best fighting condition STOP
START its entire complement of UNK officers on the UNK level had UNK as UNK for another unit , and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across UNK in world war 2 STOP
START just a month after the UNK war broke out , the 7th cavalry was moving into the lines , ready for combat STOP
START from then on the fighting seventh was in the thick of the UNK fighting in UNK STOP
START one night on the UNK river , UNK chandler called on that UNK UNK de corps STOP
START the regiment was UNK in on the east side of the river and the north UNK were steadily building up a concentration of UNK troops on the other side STOP
START the UNK knew an attack was coming , but they didn't know when , and they didn't know where STOP
START at 6 o'clock on the morning of august 12 , they were in doubt no longer STOP
START then it came , against troop aj STOP
START the enemy had UNK across the river during the night and a full force of UNK men , armed with russian machine guns , attacked the position held by UNK men STOP
START they came in waves STOP
START first came the UNK UNK , UNK UNK being driven into death as a massive human UNK UNK STOP
START they were followed by UNK north UNK troops , who mounted one charge after another STOP
START they UNK the 7th UNK forward UNK positions through UNK weight of numbers , over UNK of their own dead STOP
START another force UNK the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear STOP
START captain chandler saw that it was building up strength STOP
START he assembled a group of 25 men , composed of wounded UNK UNK UNK , the company UNK , supply men , UNK and UNK , and led them to the hill STOP
START one of the more seriously wounded was lieutenant UNK , the young officer UNK for the regular army STOP
START chandler left UNK at the bottom of the hill to direct any UNK he could find to the fight STOP
START then UNK chandler started up the hill STOP
START he took one step , two , broke into a trot and then into a run STOP
START the first thing he knew the words `` garryowen '' ! ! STOP
START burst from his UNK STOP
START his UNK UNK the old battle cry after him and charged the hill , firing as they ran STOP
START the UNK fell back , but UNK at the top of the hill and UNK down the UNK with a screen of fire STOP
START chandler , looking to right and left to see how his men were UNK , suddenly saw another figure UNK up the hill , UNK UNK and UNK the battle cry as he ran STOP
START it was bob UNK , who had suddenly found himself UNK with the spirit of garryowen STOP
START he had formed his own task force of three UNK and led them up the hill in a fighting seventh charge STOP
START because of this UNK attack the main group that had been UNK down on the hill was able to UNK forward again STOP
START but an enemy UNK hit UNK in the head and UNK simultaneously STOP
START he went down like a wet UNK and the UNK hit the dirt in the face of the UNK enemy fire STOP
START enemy UNK came UNK down , seeking a soft spot STOP
START they found it at the UNK between troops h and g , and prepared to UNK STOP
START UNK UNK saw what was happening STOP
START he turned to his UNK STOP
START `` UNK , men '' , he said STOP
START `` follow me '' STOP
START UNK UNK to his feet and started forward , `` garryowen '' ! ! STOP
START on his UNK , his men following STOP
START but the bullets UNK home before he finished his battle cry and UNK UNK fell dead STOP
START for an UNK his men UNK , unable to believe that their lieutenant , the most popular officer in the regiment , was dead STOP
START then they let out a UNK of UNK and UNK and , UNK , UNK and UNK `` garryowen '' ! ! STOP
START they charged into the enemy like wild men STOP
START that finished the job that captain chandler and lieutenant UNK had begun STOP
START UNK UNK pushed back the enemy soldiers and broke up the UNK of the entire enemy attack STOP
START UNK came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by UNK UNK STOP
START the north UNK UNK away their guns and fled across the rice UNK STOP
START UNK and air strikes were called in to kill them by the hundreds STOP
START though bob UNK seemed to have had his head practically UNK off by the UNK UNK , he lived STOP
START today he is a major -- in the regular army STOP
START so filled was UNK chandler with the spirit of garryowen that after UNK was over , he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment STOP
START after years of UNK , nights and UNK , he put together the big , UNK illustrated book , of garryowen and glory , which is probably the most complete history of any military unit STOP
START the battle of the UNK river is just one example of how the battle cry and the spirit of the fighting seventh have paid off STOP
START for nearly a century the cry has never failed to UNK the fighting men of the regiment STOP
START take the case of major UNK UNK , who UNK the battle of the little big horn in UNK STOP
START from the UNK men he UNK to the UNK officer whose wife he tried to UNK , a lot of men had plenty of reason UNK to UNK UNK UNK STOP
START many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him STOP
START but when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of UNK made against him , the men who had seen UNK leave the UNK and the officer who had heard UNK suggest that the wounded be left to be UNK by the UNK , refused to say a UNK word against him STOP
START he was a member of the fighting seventh STOP
START although it was at the battle of the little horn , about which more words have been written than any other battle in american history , that the 7th cavalry first made its mark in history , the regiment was ten years old by then STOP
START UNK major general george UNK UNK was the UNK first permanent commander and , like such UNK as george UNK and UNK de la UNK UNK in their rise to military UNK , UNK was a UNK in blood and UNK warfare STOP
START during the civil war , UNK , who achieved a brilliant record , was made UNK general at the age of 23 STOP
START he finished the war as a major general , UNK a full division , and at 25 was the UNK major general in the history of the UNK STOP
START i do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are UNK , in the sense that everyone UNK with them STOP
START if they were , walter UNK would be writing the same columns as george UNK , and UNK UNK would have nothing to draw UNK about STOP
START i do mean , however , that i take them for granted , and that everything i shall be saying would appear quite UNK against any contrary assumptions STOP
START assumption 1 STOP
START the ultimate objective of american policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material UNK ; ; STOP
START and in particular -- since this is our special responsibility -- that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the united states STOP
START i speak of `` the largest possible measure '' because any person who UNK that these conditions can be UNK and perfectly achieved -- ever -- UNK without the inherent UNK of himself and his fellow human beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around STOP
START assumption 2 STOP
START these conditions are UNK -- are not even UNK in the qualified sense i have indicated -- without the prior defeat of world communism STOP
START this is true for two reasons : because communism is both UNK , and in practice , UNK to these conditions ; ; STOP
START and because communists have the will and , as long as soviet power remains UNK , the capacity to prevent their realization STOP
START moreover , as communist power increases , the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world UNK UNK UNK and the possibility of their UNK becomes increasingly remote STOP
START assumption 3 STOP
START it follows that victory over communism is the dominant , UNK goal of american policy STOP
START UNK in the sense that there are more distant , more `` positive '' ends we seek , to which victory over communism is but a means STOP
START but dominant in the sense that every other objective , no matter how worthy UNK , must UNK to it STOP
START peace is a worthy objective ; ; STOP
START but if we must choose between peace and keeping the communists out of berlin , then we must fight STOP
START freedom , in the sense of UNK , is a worthy objective ; ; STOP
START but if UNK UNK to the UNK UNK UNK UNK that area into the UNK orbit , then UNK freedom must be UNK STOP
START justice is a worthy objective ; ; STOP
START but if justice for UNK UNK driving the government of the union of south africa away from the west , then the UNK must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer STOP
START UNK is a worthy objective ; ; STOP
START but if providing higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist communist UNK , then material UNK and UNK will have to be made STOP
START it may be , of course , that such objectives can be UNK UNK with a policy designed to UNK communism ; ; STOP
START my point is that where UNK arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a UNK world -- the absence of soviet communist power STOP
START the uses of power STOP
START this much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do -- defeat communism -- and , if so , how those resources ought to be used STOP
START this brings us UNK to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power STOP
START i UNK that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be STOP
START and i suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of american UNK , ever since we assumed free world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem UNK and seriously STOP
START in the recent political campaign two charges were UNK UNK the question of power , and i think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus STOP
START one was UNK false ; ; STOP
START the other , for the most part , true STOP
START the first was that america had become -- or was in danger of becoming -- a UNK military power STOP
START i know i do not have to UNK here on the UNK of that UNK STOP
START you may have UNK about certain aspects of our military establishment -- i certainly do -- but you know any comparison of over-all american strength with over-all soviet strength finds the united states not only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage UNK to be a permanent feature of UNK relations for the UNK future STOP
START i have often UNK for a UNK way of UNK our UNK on those americans who have UNK , and i think UNK UNK has done it well in his new book american might and soviet myth STOP
START suppose , he says , that the tables were turned , and we were in the UNK position : `` there would be more than UNK modern soviet UNK , all better than ours , UNK at UNK bases in mexico and the UNK STOP
START overwhelming russian naval power would always be within a few hundred miles of our coast STOP
START half of the population of the UNK be needed to work on arms just to feed the people '' STOP
START add this to the UNK in the countries around us where UNK peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity STOP
START add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep UNK of the UNK even in the missile field which is UNK to be our main strength STOP
START if we look at the situation this way , we can get an idea of UNK UNK UNK -- or , at least , of the UNK he might have if his enemies were disposed to UNK their advantage STOP
START UNK prestige '' STOP
START the other charge was that america's political position in the world has UNK UNK in recent years STOP
START the UNK needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been done , i fail to see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it STOP
START the argument was typically advanced in terms of UNK prestige '' STOP
START prestige , however , is only a minor part of the problem ; ; STOP
START and even then , it is a concept that can be highly UNK STOP
START prestige is a measure of how other people think of you , well or ill STOP
START but contrary to what was implied during the campaign , prestige is surely not important for its own sake STOP
START only the UNK and UNK UNK among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be STOP
START the thing to lose sleep over is what people , having concluded that we are UNK than we are , are likely to do about it STOP
START the evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the united states is UNK than the soviet union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead STOP
START this UNK estimate , i repeat , is not of any interest in itself ; ; STOP
START but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do -- namely , by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side STOP
START to the extent , then , that UNK UNK means that other nations will be UNK to place their UNK on an ultimate american defeat , and will thus be more UNK to soviet UNK , there is reason for concern STOP
START still , these UNK about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the soviet union and ourselves STOP
START here i do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power -- of influence , if you will -- about which the relevant questions are : is soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago ? ? STOP
START and is western influence greater or less than it used to be ? ? STOP
START communist UNK STOP
START in UNK these questions , we need to ask not merely whether communist troops have crossed over into UNK they did not occupy before , and not merely whether UNK agents of the UNK are in control of governments from which they were formerly UNK : the success of UNK war against the west does not depend on such spectacular and UNK UNK STOP
START success may mean merely the displacement of western influence STOP
START communist political warfare , we must remember , is UNK UNK and in UNK stages STOP
START UNK of UNK a military UNK with the west which they could not win , the communists seek to UNK western power where the nuclear might of the west is UNK -- in UNK UNK UNK , in UNK UNK in the streets , in UNK , in UNK meetings of UNK UNK , at the united nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences -- preferably at the highest level STOP
START the UNK understand , moreover , that the first step in turning a country toward communism is to turn it against the west STOP
START thus , typically , the first stage of a communist UNK is to `` UNK '' a country STOP
START the second stage is to UNK the UNK classification of `` UNK '' , while in fact turning the country into an active UNK and UNK of soviet policy STOP
START and this may be as far as the process will go STOP
START the UNK goal is the isolation and capture , not of UNK , but of the united states -- and this purpose may be served very well by countries that UNK under a `` UNK '' UNK , yet in fact are UNK UNK of the soviet foreign office STOP
START to UNK the UNK of recent soviet successes is hardly UNK STOP
START six years ago french UNK , though in UNK , was in the western camp STOP
START today northern UNK is UNK communist ; ; STOP
START laos is UNK between communism and UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK is , for all practical purposes , UNK STOP
START UNK , in the early days of the republic , UNK toward the west STOP
START today UNK government is heavily UNK by UNK communists , and for all of its `` UNK '' UNK , it is a firm UNK of soviet policy STOP
START UNK has moved from a UNK orientation to a UNK openly hostile to the west STOP
START in the middle east , UNK , UNK and egypt were , a short while ago , in the western camp STOP
START today the UNK and UNK governments are UNK hostile to the west , are dependent for their military power on soviet equipment and personnel ; ; STOP
START in almost every particular follow the UNK foreign policy line STOP
START a short time ago all africa was a western preserve STOP
START never mind whether the UNK and the UNK enjoyed UNK UNK : the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the west STOP
START today , africa is UNK UNK away from the west and UNK , it would seem , into the soviet orbit STOP
START latin america was once an area as `` safe '' for the west as UNK was for UNK STOP
START today it is up for UNK STOP
START one latin american country , cuba , has become a soviet UNK ninety miles off our coast STOP
START in some countries the trend has gone further than others : mexico , UNK , and UNK are UNK open sympathy for UNK , and there is no country -- save the UNK republic whose UNK services we recently arranged -- where UNK and UNK does not prevent the government from UNK UNK the american cause STOP
START only in europe have our lines remained firm -- and there only on the surface STOP
START the UNK of UNK are running strong , notably in england , and even in germany STOP
START opportunities UNK STOP
START what have we to show by way of UNK ? ? STOP
START we have had opportunities -- clear UNK to plant our influence on the other side of the iron UNK STOP
START there was the UNK revolution which we UNK and UNK , but did nothing about STOP
START there was the UNK revolution which we UNK and then helped guide along a course favorable to soviet interests STOP
START there was the revolution in UNK which we UNK did not exist STOP
START only in one instance have we moved UNK and effectively to UNK existing communist power : in UNK STOP
START and contrary to what has been said recently , we did not wait for `` outside pressures '' and `` world opinion '' to bring down that communist government ; ; STOP
START we moved UNK to effect an UNK UNK UNK STOP
START we served our national interests , and by so doing we saved the UNK people the ultimate in human misery STOP
START the first UNK of the machine guns , at UNK in the evening , UNK around me the varied UNK and faces of fear STOP
START `` sounds exactly like last time '' STOP
START the young man spoke steadily enough , but all at once he looked UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK man said over and over , `` why did i come here , why did i come here '' STOP
START then he was sick STOP
START amid the UNK of small arms and automatic weapons , i heard the UNK of UNK STOP
START then the lights went out STOP
START this was my second day in UNK , the administrative capital of laos , and my thoughts were none too brave STOP
START where was my UNK ? ? STOP
START where should i go ? ? STOP
START to my room ? ? STOP
START better stay in the hotel UNK , where the walls looked good and thick STOP
START chinese and indian merchants across the street were UNK their steel UNK STOP

START the american UNK UNK about getting to the UNK office STOP
START but what was the story ? ? STOP
START had the UNK UNK lao finally come this far ? ? STOP
START or was it another UNK inside UNK ? ? STOP
START `` UNK play hero '' , i said STOP
START `` UNK go to the roof and see '' STOP
START UNK UNK the moon STOP
START by UNK the answer was plain STOP
START there had been an UNK of the moon STOP
START a traditional lao explanation is that the moon was being UNK by a UNK , and the remedy was to make all possible noise , UNK with UNK STOP
START the UNK was successful , too , for just before the moon disappeared , the UNK UNK had begun to UNK it out again , which meant good luck all around STOP
START how UNK it all seemed the next day STOP
START a restaurant UNK a UNK to UNK `` who became UNK and left without paying their UNK '' STOP
START but everyone i met had sought cover first and asked questions later STOP
START and no wonder , for UNK , the old city of UNK , had become the city of bullet holes STOP
START i saw holes in planes at the UNK and in cars in the streets STOP
START along the main UNK hardly a house had not been UNK STOP
START in place of the police headquarters was a new square filled with UNK STOP
START UNK had UNK the defense ministry and set fire to the american embassy next door STOP
START what had been the UNK UNK was now UNK walls of UNK UNK STOP
START this damage had been done in the battle of UNK , fought less than three months earlier when four UNK governments had ruled here in three days ( december UNK , 1960 ) STOP
START and now , in march , all laos suffered a state of UNK STOP
START the UNK lao forces held two northern UNK and openly took the UNK in three more STOP
START throughout the land their UNK UNK spread fear of UNK and death STOP
START `` and it's all the more tragic because it's so little UNK '' , said UNK , a UNK official of the united nations educational , scientific , and cultural organization STOP
START we talked after i UNK his UNK marked with the UNK STOP
START practically all the people of laos , he explained -- about two million of them -- are rice farmers , and the means and motives of modern war are as strange to them as UNK and steel UNK STOP
START they look after their fields and children and water UNK in ten or eleven thousand villages , with an average of 200 souls STOP
START nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are STOP
START they spread over an area no larger than UNK ; ; STOP
START yet they include peoples as different from one another as UNK are from UNK STOP
START life must be kept in harmony STOP

START UNK , UNK girls at the UNK in harmony with the UNK by the UNK STOP

START for so long as death was not violent , it was natural and to be UNK , making a UNK a UNK STOP
START to many a UNK -- they came UNK years ago , UNK , and stayed until laos became independent in 1953 -- the land had been even more UNK UNK than UNK STOP
START yet laos was now one of the most UNK UNK of UNK around the UNK STOP
START the UNK lao , UNK by communist UNK from neighboring north UNK UNK , were supplied by soviet aircraft STOP
START the royal lao army , on the other hand , was paid and equipped with american funds STOP
START in six years , UNK had UNK to more than UNK for each american -- a total of three hundred million dollars STOP
START we were there at a moment when the situation in laos threatened to UNK another war among the world's UNK STOP
START even if it did not , how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of UNK and UNK guns ? ? STOP
START to find out , we traveled throughout that part of laos still UNK controlled , in the daytime at least , by the royal lao army : from UNK , the city of UNK UNK in the UNK , to UNK sing , the city of UNK in the northwest , close to communist china ( map , page UNK ) STOP
START we rode over roads so rough that our UNK came to rest UNK the soil between UNK , all four UNK UNK UNK STOP
START we UNK in UNK planes so UNK that we UNK why they didn't UNK STOP
START in the end we ran into communist UNK fire STOP

START before the UNK came , he said , travel in laos was just about impossible STOP
START prime minister moves fast STOP
START UNK , so it almost proved for us , too STOP
START to go outside the few cities required permits STOP
START and getting them seemed a UNK work STOP
START nobody wanted americans to be UNK or captured , and few soldiers could be UNK as UNK STOP
START we were told that to the UNK lao , a UNK american was worth at least UNK , a UNK in laos STOP
START everyone had heard of the american UNK who had UNK an UNK STOP
START now UNK lao UNK were reported UNK him UNK from village to village , as evidence of evil american intervention STOP
START although we enjoyed our UNK of the government offices in UNK , with officials offering tea and UNK conversation in french , we were getting nowhere STOP
START we had nearly decided that all the tales of lao UNK must be true , when we were invited to take a trip with the prime minister STOP
START could we be ready in 15 minutes ? ? STOP
START his UNK had decided only two hours ago to go out of town , and he was eager to be off STOP
START prince UNK UNK UNK STOP
START and so , after a flight UNK to UNK , we found ourselves UNK along in a UNK right behind the UNK of prince UNK UNK of UNK , a tall man of UNK UNK in a UNK UNK and a UNK UNK from texas STOP
START from his shoulder bag UNK the UNK barrel of a UNK STOP
START the temperature rose to UNK STOP
START with our company of soldiers , we made one long column of UNK dust STOP
START in UNK UNK , the city of UNK , the prime minister bought UNK UNK and UNK UNK , and two UNK for me STOP
START then we drove on , until there was no more road and we UNK dry rice fields , UNK across their UNK earth walls STOP
START it was a UNK day STOP
START an hour of UNK , a brief stop in a village to UNK a new school or UNK STOP
START more UNK , another stop , a new house for teachers , a new well STOP
START then off again , UNK to keep up STOP
START we were UNK STOP
START but our two UNK UNK -- UNK UNK from UNK UNK and john cool from UNK , pennsylvania -- were UNK under their coatings of dust STOP
START together they had probably done more than any other men to help push laos toward the UNK century -- UNK STOP

START the prime minister paid his respects to the UNK UNK , UNK rapidly among the houses , UNK with the local UNK , and made a speech STOP
START the soldiers are fighting and the americans are helping , he said , but in the fight against the UNK lao the key factor is the UNK himself STOP

START the prince visited the hospital of operation UNK , supported by the junior chamber of commerce of the UNK , and fed rice to two UNK UNK he kept at his residence at UNK song STOP
START UNK keep souls in place STOP
START in the village of UNK , which means `` peaceful '' , we had a UNK STOP
START this is the most UNK of lao UNK STOP
START it takes place in the household , a UNK of UNK for UNK occasions -- for the UNK , a UNK , a UNK child , the sick , the new year , for any good purpose STOP
START the preparations were elaborate : flowers , UNK , UNK UNK , rice wine , UNK of UNK , and pieces of white cotton string STOP
START the UNK were UNK around flowers in tall silver UNK ( page UNK ) STOP
START the UNK were UNK , and we sat on UNK UNK among the village UNK STOP
START i was careful to keep my feet , the seat of the least worthy spirits , from pointing at UNK head , where the UNK spirits UNK STOP
START now a distinguished old man called on nine UNK to come and join us STOP
START next he UNK himself to our souls STOP
START a man has UNK souls , one for each part of the body STOP
START those souls like to UNK off , and must be called back STOP
START with the UNK present and our souls in place , we were wished health , happiness , and power STOP
START then , one after another , the UNK tied the waiting cotton UNK around our UNK STOP
START these were to be kept on , to hold in the UNK souls STOP
START as we stepped out into the UNK , a man came up to john cool and UNK showed him his hand STOP
START it had a UNK hole as big as a silver dollar STOP
START we could see UNK moving STOP
START john said : `` i have some UNK UNK with me , but it's too late for that '' STOP
START my interviews with UNK UNK this portrait of the UNK of religious and UNK bonds STOP
START jewish identity was often confused with social and economic UNK STOP
START `` being jewish gives you tremendous drive '' , a boy remarked STOP
START `` it means that you have to get ahead '' STOP
START when i pressed for a purely religious definition , i encountered the familiar UNK of liberal UNK , UNK good will , and a small UNK of UNK loyalty STOP
START `` i like the tradition '' , a girl said STOP
START `` i like to follow the UNK when they come along STOP
START but you don't have to worship in the traditional way STOP
START you can UNK in your own way STOP
START as i see it , there's no real difference between being jewish , catholic , or protestant '' STOP
START another UNK remarked : `` most jews don't believe in god , but they believe in people -- in helping people '' STOP
START still another boy asserted : `` to be a good jew is to do no wrong ; ; STOP
START it's to be a good person '' STOP
START when asked how this was different from being a good protestant , the boy answered , `` it's the same thing '' STOP
START this UNK with the study by UNK and UNK STOP
START they discovered that , although UNK per cent of a sample of catholic students and 15 per cent of the protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the UNK of their religion , only 8 per cent of the jewish students had this conviction STOP
START the most important aims of the jewish students were as follows : to make the world a better place to live in -- 30 per cent ; ; STOP
START to get happiness for yourself -- UNK per cent ; ; STOP
START and financial independence -- 21 per cent STOP
START nevertheless , most of the UNK i UNK believed in maintaining their jewish identity and even UNK UNK a UNK or temple STOP
START however , they were hostile to jewish UNK , UNK to believe in UNK `` but in a moderate way '' STOP
START one boy said UNK about orthodox jews : `` it's the twentieth century , and they don't have to wear UNK '' STOP
START the reason offered for UNK to the UNK faith lacked force and authority even in the UNK minds STOP
START `` we were brought up that way '' was one statement which won general UNK STOP
START `` i want to show respect for my UNK religion '' was the way in which a boy justified his UNK a UNK house of UNK STOP
START still another suggested that he would join a temple `` for social reasons , since i'll be living in a UNK '' STOP
START UNK , which is generally regarded as a threat to jewish survival , was regarded not with UNK or UNK but with a kind of UNK , clinical disapproval STOP
START most of the UNK i UNK rejected it on UNK grounds STOP
START `` when you UNK , you want to have things in common '' , a girl said , `` and it's hard when you don't UNK someone with your own background '' STOP
START a UNK girl from the middle west observed UNK that , in her community , religion UNK UNK with religious activities -- at least with the UNK activities that many middle class jews now regard as religious STOP
START it appears that an orthodox girl in the community UNK plans for an UNK sponsored by one of the jewish service groups because she would not travel on UNK and , in addition , required UNK food STOP
START another girl from a relatively large UNK city described herself as `` the only orthodox girl in town '' STOP
START this is , no doubt , UNK , but it does UNK how isolated she feels among the vast army of the UNK STOP
START the older UNK STOP
START one of the significant things about jewish culture in the older UNK years is that it is largely UNK STOP
START UNK per cent of the jewish UNK of college age attend institutions of higher learning STOP
START this is substantially higher than the figures for the american population at large -- UNK per cent for males and UNK per cent for females STOP
START this may help explain a phenomenon described by a UNK jewish boy STOP
START in their first two years in high school , jewish boys in this town make UNK UNK to win positions on the school teams STOP
START however , in their junior and senior years , they generally UNK their athletic UNK , presumably in the interest of better academic achievement STOP
START it is significant , too , that the older UNK i UNK believed , unlike the younger ones , that jewish students tend to do better UNK than their UNK counterparts STOP
START the percentage of jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys STOP
START the UNK for both UNK , to be sure , are different STOP
START the vocational motive is the dominant one for boys , while jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become UNK developed STOP
START one of the significant developments in UNK life is that the cultural UNK are largely the women STOP
START it is they who read -- and make -- jewish UNK and then UNK their UNK to read them STOP
START in upper UNK jewish life , the UNK group tends to have a sense of UNK STOP
START `` people automatically assume that i'm in college '' , a UNK UNK observed UNK STOP
START however , among the girls , there are some UNK UNK for not going to college STOP
START the jewish working girl almost invariably works in an office -- in UNK to UNK factory workers -- and , UNK by a respectable income , she is likely to dress better and live more UNK than the college student STOP
START she is even UNK to regard the college girl as UNK STOP
START the UNK class college student STOP
START one of the reasons for the high percentage of jewish UNK in college is that a great many urban jews are UNK to attend local colleges at UNK cost STOP
START this is particularly true in large centers of jewish population like new york , chicago , and philadelphia STOP
START what is UNK about this large group of UNK is that , although their attitudes hardly UNK them from their UNK counterparts , they actually lead their lives in a vast UNK jewish UNK with relatively little contact with the UNK world STOP
START perhaps the jewish students at brooklyn college -- UNK UNK per cent of those who attend the day session -- can serve as a UNK of the urban , UNK class jewish student STOP
START there is , to begin , an important sex difference STOP
START typically , in a UNK class jewish family , a son will be sent to an UNK school , if financial resources warrant it , while the daughter will attend the local college STOP
START there are two reasons for this STOP
START first , the UNK education has a lower UNK than the UNK STOP
START second , the attitude in jewish families is far more UNK toward the daughter than toward the son STOP
START most jewish mothers are determined to exercise UNK over the social and sexual lives of their UNK by keeping them home STOP
START the consequence of this is that the girls at brooklyn college UNK the boys and do somewhat better UNK STOP
START one can assume that some of the UNK boys are out of town STOP
START brooklyn college students have an UNK attitude toward their school STOP
START on the one hand , there is a sense of not having moved beyond the UNK of their high school STOP
START this is particularly UNK for those who attended UNK high school directly across the street from brooklyn college STOP
START they have a sense of UNK at being denied that special UNK of status , the UNK school STOP
START at the same time , there is a good deal of UNK at attending a good college -- they are even inclined to UNK its not UNK UNK -- and they express pleasure at the UNK UNK feeling that the college UNK STOP
START `` it's people of your own kind '' , a girl remarked STOP
START `` you don't have to watch what you say STOP
START of course , i would like to go to an UNK school where there are all kinds of people , but i would want lots of jewish UNK there '' STOP
START for most brooklyn college students , college is at once a UNK of their UNK UNK and a breaking away from the UNK of neighborhood and family STOP
START brooklyn college is UNK jewish in tone , and efforts to UNK the college by bringing in UNK UNK types on the faculty have been UNK STOP
START however , a growing intellectual UNK and the new UNK UNK by courses in psychology and UNK make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat UNK and UNK parents STOP
START and the UNK of these third generation jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but , rather , a protest against a culture that they view as UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START `` as long as i'm home , i'll never grow up '' , a UNK boy observed UNK STOP
START `` they don't like it if i do anything away from home STOP
START it's so much trouble , i don't usually UNK '' STOP
START for girls , the UNK is far more UNK STOP
START parents will drive on friday night to pick up their UNK after a UNK or house plan meeting STOP
START a UNK UNK father not too long ago called a dean at brooklyn college and demanded the `` UNK '' on a boy who was going out with his daughter STOP
START the domestic UNK even extend to the choice of a major field STOP
START under pressure from parents , the majority of brooklyn college girls major in education since that UNK best with marriage plans -- limited graduate study requirement and convenient working hours STOP
START this means that a great many UNK UNK girls are discouraged from UNK graduate work of a more demanding nature STOP
START a kind of double standard exists here for jewish boys and girls as it does in the realm of sex STOP
START the breaking away from the prison house of brooklyn is gradual STOP
START first , the student UNK on his UNK parents the heavy UNK of his newly acquired psychological and UNK insights STOP
START then , with the new UNK , there is actually a UNK forth into the wide , wide world beyond the UNK of new york STOP
START it is significant that the UNK , which used to be the summer UNK for older UNK , a kind of summer UNK of new york , no longer UNK them in great numbers -- except for those who work there as UNK , bus boys , or UNK in the day camps STOP
START the great world beyond UNK STOP
START but it should be pointed out that some of the new UNK places -- fire island , UNK , UNK , long island , for example -- tend to be UNK jewish STOP
START although brooklyn college does not yet have a UNK program , a good number of students spend UNK in europe STOP
START in general , however , the UNK of travel UNK considerably behind that of the student at harvard or smith STOP
START and UNK into the world at large is likely to occur for the brooklyn college student after college rather than during the four school years STOP
START brooklyn college is UNK UNK territory , as much as the UNK or central park west STOP
START there are UNK of UNK young women there who , UNK by their UNK mothers , are determined to UNK STOP
START it is interesting that , although the percentage of married students is not UNK higher at brooklyn than elsewhere -- about 30 per cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the UNK class -- the anxiety of the UNK has UNK up the estimate STOP
START `` almost everybody in the senior class is married '' , students say UNK STOP
START and the school newspaper UNK space to UNK UNK , UNK , and houses ( in the house plan association ) that have good news to UNK STOP
START these UNK are , in effect , UNK for themselves as UNK marriage UNK STOP
START there are UNK UNK in the newspaper of UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , and marriages in a UNK UNK UNK of UNK STOP
START `` UNK house UNK UNK the UNK of UNK UNK to UNK UNK of UNK house '' STOP
START the brooklyn college student shows some striking UNK from prevailing UNK models STOP
START the UNK league UNK no easy UNK here , and the boys are as likely to dress in rather UNK UNK fashion , or even in UNK working class manner , as they are in the UNK , UNK UNK way STOP
START the girls are UNK to dress far more UNK than their counterparts out of town , and eye UNK , UNK , and elaborate UNK UNK -- despite the UNK of UNK guidance personnel -- are not unknown even in early morning classes STOP
START among the boys , there is very little UNK about drinking STOP
START brooklyn college is distinctive for not having an official drinking place STOP
START the fort UNK UNK for drinking is foreign to most brooklyn college boys STOP
START this should be used frequently ( but UNK before using ) STOP
START for UNK UNK , the mother should UNK into half a cup of fresh UNK UNK enough white UNK to make a UNK STOP
START this could also be used for any other skin UNK STOP
START or she might place UNK in the UNK for a short time and then apply this under her UNK STOP
START `` female UNK '' of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the frontier ; ; STOP
START at least i have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection , one for UNK delayed UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK UNK tea STOP
START UNK , UNK , cuts , etc, occurred frequently on the frontier , and folk medicine gave the answers to these problems too STOP
START UNK and black eyes were relieved by application of raw UNK STOP
START ( doctors now say that it was not the meat but the UNK of the applications which relieved the pain STOP
START ) UNK butter was another cure for UNK STOP
START many people agreed that UNK should be treated with UNK UNK UNK or UNK butter or UNK , but one UNK told me that a UNK should be UNK in salt water ; ; STOP
START the UNK UNK UNK fluid for many days , and finally the UNK was completed by UNK it with UNK UNK STOP
START another UNK by UNK UNK for UNK , and still another recommended UNK butter STOP
START `` butter UNK '' or `` butter UNK '' was used for UNK , and for UNK as well STOP
START this was made by putting butter in a UNK of water and allowing it to UNK ; ; STOP
START when it was cool , the fat was UNK off and UNK STOP
START UNK milk was another cure for UNK , and UNK covered with UNK UNK or plain UNK UNK quickly STOP
START one man , badly burned about the face and eyes by an arc UNK UNK , was UNK and could not find a doctor at the time STOP
START a sympathetic friend made UNK of raw UNK UNK , which she said was the best and UNK way to draw out the `` heat '' STOP
START later the doctor used UNK oil on the UNK STOP
START the results were good , but which treatment helped is still not known STOP
START to stop UNK , UNK were applied to cuts and UNK STOP
START one UNK said to UNK sugar on a UNK cut , even when on a UNK , if it was made by a UNK tool ; ; STOP
START this would stop the flow and also prevent UNK STOP
START my lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy for cuts and UNK ; ; STOP
START she UNK common sugar directly on the injury and then bound it UNK with cotton cloth , over which she poured UNK STOP
START he showed me one of his fingers which had been practically UNK and which his mother had treated ; ; STOP
START there is scarcely a UNK showing STOP
START tobacco was common first aid STOP
START a `` UNK '' of tobacco put on an open UNK was both UNK and UNK STOP
START or a thin UNK of plug tobacco might be laid on the open UNK without UNK STOP
START one old man told me that when he was a boy he was UNK in the head by a UNK UNK and had his UNK laid back from the entire front of his head STOP
START his brother ran a mile to get the father ; ; STOP
START when they reached the boy , the father UNK a new plug of tobacco , put the UNK back in place , and covered the raw edges with the UNK STOP
START then he put a UNK around the UNK to keep it in place STOP
START there was no cleaning or further care , but the UNK UNK in less than two weeks and showed no UNK STOP
START UNK from the UNK garden was also used to stop UNK , and UNK was an UNK STOP
START until quite recently , `` UNK '' UNK could be bought to apply to a UNK ; ; STOP
START they would feed on its surface , leaving it clean so that it could be UNK treated STOP
START UNK could be avoided by UNK warm UNK over a UNK STOP

START UNK were UNK or prevented by `` UNK '' which the pioneer UNK or carried STOP
START in UNK there were known to be UNK in UNK county , and one had been in the family for 200 years STOP
START another cure for UNK was to UNK the UNK , then UNK them with a hot knife or UNK STOP
START while UNK we recognize the fact that there are many causes for UNK at the nose , not long ago a UNK was simply that , and treatment had little variation STOP
START since a fall or UNK might have caused it , a cold pack was usually first aid STOP
START this might be applied to the top of the nose or the back of the neck , pressed on the upper UNK , or inserted into the UNK ( cotton was usually used in this last ) STOP
START UNK could be stopped by UNK a red UNK string about the patient's neck and UNK it in a UNK for each year of his life STOP
START or the victim could UNK hard on a piece of paper , meanwhile pressing his fingers UNK in his ears STOP
START old UNK could be UNK by the constant application of a wash made of equal parts UNK and water STOP
START blood UNK could be prevented from forming by UNK a work UNK immediately with any hard UNK substance STOP
START UNK were UNK by taking common salt and drying it in the UNK , UNK it fine , and UNK it with equal parts of spirits of UNK ; ; STOP
START this mixture was then spread on a cloth and UNK around the affected part STOP
START as the cloth dried , more of the mixture was applied , and after UNK hours the UNK was supposed to be `` killed '' STOP
START insect UNK were UNK in many ways STOP
START many an UNK UNK by the UNK method ; ; STOP
START `` get a UNK , UNK on it '' was a UNK STOP
START this was used also for UNK STOP
START yellow clay was used as a UNK for insect UNK and also for UNK ; ; STOP
START not long ago `` UNK UNK '' was most popular STOP
START UNK were a common UNK along UNK and where gardens and UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START so small as to be scarcely visible to the eye , they UNK themselves in the UNK flesh STOP
START UNK the UNK parts with UNK gave relief and also killed the UNK STOP
START UNK UNK were UNK by applying liquid UNK STOP
START for UNK UNK a UNK of half a glass of salt and half a glass of UNK was made STOP
START for UNK UNK onion UNK , obtained by UNK an onion , gave quick relief STOP
START a UNK remedy was to UNK the painful part in strong UNK water ; ; STOP
START UNK was sometimes used as well as soap STOP
START just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to UNK UNK or UNK UNK STOP
START UNK were a common UNK in pioneer days ; ; STOP
START to keep them out of homes , even in the UNK , was a UNK STOP
START bed UNK were washed in UNK water , legs of UNK were placed in UNK of UNK , and all UNK was treated UNK with UNK UNK , applied with a UNK STOP
START UNK was very effective in UNK pioneer homes of the UNK STOP
START at times pioneer children got UNK in their hair STOP
START a UNK UNK seems a heroic treatment , but it did the job STOP
START to remove an insect from one's ear warm water should be inserted STOP
START a UNK or other small object could be removed from the eye by placing a UNK in the eye STOP
START as the seed UNK its UNK covering protected the UNK from UNK , and both the UNK and the seed could soon be washed out STOP

START UNK were UNK by UNK , an old drug , used in combinations STOP
START for UNK a mixture of one UNK UNK and one UNK UNK was applied to the UNK part on UNK cloth STOP
START UNK skin , considered `` just UNK '' , was UNK by UNK with UNK and salt STOP
START winter UNK was treated by applying strong UNK UNK in which UNK UNK had been UNK STOP
START to cure UNK UNK on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a UNK of UNK UNK in a UNK of water STOP

START now one UNK that heat and hot water are used instead STOP
START another remedy was oil of UNK , used as well for UNK STOP
START UNK were also treated with UNK of UNK or UNK leaves STOP
START UNK have always been a source of much trouble STOP
START a german UNK gave me a sure cure made by UNK UNK UNK and UNK into a UNK STOP
START another UNK was made from the inner UNK of the UNK tree , UNK in water until it formed a UNK , UNK solution STOP
START this was also used for UNK STOP
START another frequent pioneer difficulty , caused by wearing rough and heavy UNK and UNK , was UNK STOP
START one UNK woman tells me she has used thin UNK UNK for both UNK and UNK on her feet and they remove the pain or `` fire '' STOP
START another common cure was to UNK the feet five or ten minutes in warm water , then to apply a solution of equal parts of UNK and common brown soap on a UNK UNK overnight STOP
START this UNK the skin so that in the morning when the UNK was removed the corn could be UNK off and a bit of corn plaster put on STOP
START there were many UNK for UNK STOP
START one young girl told me how her mother removed a wart from her finger by UNK a UNK UNK in UNK for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several times STOP
START another wart removal method was to UNK each wart with a UNK split open and then to UNK the UNK UNK under the UNK of the house for seven days STOP
START UNK gathered in the mouth after a UNK sleep was considered UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK a wart with this UNK on UNK the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to UNK after only a few treatments , and UNK enough many UNK did just that STOP
START one wart cure was to UNK it in a hair from a UNK UNK STOP
START another was to UNK raw beef in UNK for UNK hours , tie it on the wart , and wear it for a week STOP
START a simpler method was to tie a UNK UNK around the wart at its base and wear it this way STOP
START i know this worked STOP
START one person recommended to me washing the wart with UNK water ; ; STOP
START another said it should be UNK with a cut UNK three times daily STOP
START another common method was to cut an onion in two and place each half on the wart for a moment ; ; STOP
START the onion was then fastened together with string and placed beneath a UNK UNK STOP
START as the onion UNK , so did the wart STOP
START UNK muscles were relieved by an UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK feet by UNK , an UNK from the UNK UNK UNK garden , or by UNK the feet in a UNK of hot water in which two UNK of salt had been dissolved STOP
START leg UNK , one person tells me , were relieved by standing UNK with the weight of the body on the UNK and pressing down hard STOP
START this does give relief , as i can UNK STOP
START one doctor prescribed a UNK of UNK or UNK before each meal for leg UNK STOP
START UNK in the back of the leg and in the UNK were prevented from reaching the upper body by UNK a UNK about the patient's UNK STOP
START for UNK and UNK , one UNK of UNK UNK and half a UNK of spirits of UNK added to three well UNK eggs was said to give UNK relief STOP
START except for the wine UNK in a restaurant -- always an UNK UNK UNK himself , the UNK with the UNK to UNK the gates of the wine world are one's dealer , and the foreign UNK or UNK who in turn supplies him STOP
START in instances where both of these are persons or firms with UNK , the situation is ideal STOP
START it may , on occasion , be anything but that STOP
START however , by UNK a wine dealer and accepting his advice , one will soon enough UNK whether he has any knowledge of wines ( as opposed to what he may have been told by salesmen and UNK ) and , better yet , whether he has a taste for wine STOP
START again , by UNK one's purchases over several wine dealers , one becomes familiar with the names and UNK of UNK wine dealers and UNK abroad STOP
START this is important because , despite all the efforts of the french government , an UNK UNK of UNK UNK trade in wines is still UNK with a UNK approaching UNK UNK , and there are many too many UNK who would rather turn a UNK than UNK a UNK reputation overseas STOP
START a good UNK or UNK will not only be the man or the firm which has UNK the wines from the best UNK , or the best parts of them ; ; STOP
START he may also be the one who makes and UNK the best UNK -- sound wines from UNK generally in his own district STOP
START these are the wines the french themselves use for UNK drinking , for even in france virtually no one UNK the UNK UNK on a UNK basis STOP
START the UNK UNK are expensive , and even UNK UNK tire of them STOP
START and certainly , in the case of the UNK or the comparatively UNK wine UNK , the UNK and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready for the UNK UNK as a steady diet without frequent UNK to UNK of less UNK STOP
START there is nothing UNK UNK about a good UNK from a good UNK STOP
START some of them are very UNK indeed , and there are many good ones UNK -- unfortunately , along with others not so good , and worse STOP
START UNK with a UNK wine dealer and constant experimentation -- `` UNK ever from the known to the unknown '' -- are the UNK STOP
START wine UNK are something else again ; ; STOP
START especially if one is UNK or dining out a great deal , their importance UNK STOP
START most of them , the world over , operate on the same principle by which justice is UNK in france and some other latin countries : the customer is to be considered guilty of UNK ignorance until UNK otherwise , with the burden of proof on the customer himself STOP
START now the drinking of wine ( and UNK so ! ! STOP
START ) is for the most part a UNK affair , for UNK , if everyone in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them , the supply would dry up in no time at all STOP
START this is the only valid , and UNK , argument that may be advanced in defense of the UNK attitude of the common wine UNK STOP
START a really good wine UNK is , UNK , the UNK ( and not the UNK ) of his cellar against the UNK STOP
START faced , on the one hand , with an always UNK supply of his best wines , and on the other by a UNK usually equipped with UNK UNK , it is a wonder indeed that all wine UNK are not UNK with UNK UNK STOP
START the one way to get around them -- short of knowing exactly what one wants and UNK to it -- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine UNK is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money STOP
START only then , perhaps , will he reveal his UNK and his UNK STOP
START wine bought from a dealer should UNK be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served STOP
START this is especially true of red wines , and a practice which , though not always UNK , is well worth the effort STOP
START it does no UNK for wine to stand on end for a matter of days , but in terms of months and years it is fatal STOP
START wine stored for a long time should be on its side ; ; STOP
START otherwise , the UNK UNK and air enters to UNK it STOP
START when UNK wine on its side in a UNK , care should always be taken to be sure there is no air UNK left next to the UNK STOP
START fat UNK , such as UNK , have a way of UNK around in the UNK and often need little UNK , such as a bit of UNK or a UNK of wood , to hold them in the proper UNK UNK STOP
START too much UNK in the cellar UNK the UNK , again with ill effects STOP
START the best rule of UNK for UNK UNK wine ( provided the eye has not already UNK it ) is to UNK the wet end of the UNK after UNK it : if it UNK of wine , the bottle is probably all right ; ; STOP
START if it UNK of UNK , one has grounds for suspicion STOP
START UNK rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine : they age it UNK STOP
START the ideal storage temperature for long periods is about UNK degrees , with an UNK range of five degrees above or below this , provided there are no sudden or frequent changes STOP
START prolonged UNK is also UNK ; ; STOP
START consequently , one's wine UNK or cellar should be away from machines or UNK driven UNK STOP
START if one lives near a UNK or an express UNK , the solution is to have one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time STOP
START light , especially UNK , is always bad for wine STOP
START all in all , though , there is a good deal of UNK UNK over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking ; ; STOP
START many people go to extreme lengths in UNK , UNK or UNK , or UNK without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly UNK UNK STOP
START no one should wish to deny these UNK the obvious pleasure they derive from all this , and to give fair warning where warning is due , no one who becomes UNK of wines ever UNK UNK some degree of UNK ! ! STOP
START but the fact remains that in most UNK , including some of the best of paris and UNK and UNK , the bottle is UNK and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered , and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the UNK is preparing the meal STOP
START a white wine , already at cool cellar temperature , may be adequately UNK in a UNK of ice and water or the UNK UNK of a UNK ( the former is far UNK ) in about fifteen minutes ; ; STOP
START for those who live in a winter climate , there is nothing better than a UNK of water and snow STOP
START though by no means an ideal procedure , a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time STOP

START there is much to be said for a college that , while UNK UNK to the sophisticated UNK , still gives its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along back roads where a UNK of small game , UNK , or even bear is not UNK STOP
START city boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an UNK handle or in the sharp UNK of a UNK , come upon suddenly in a UNK UNK camp STOP
START and on the UNK of mount washington , where UNK degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered higher than anywhere else in the world , there is a kind of wisdom to be found that other men often seek in the UNK `` because it is there '' STOP
START there is much to be said for such a college -- and dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too UNK STOP
START their affection for their college home has even caused president UNK to comment on this `` place loyalty '' as something rather UNK UNK STOP
START probably a lawyer once said it best for all time in the supreme court of the united states STOP
START early in the nineteenth century the state of new UNK was UNK about for a way to found its own state university STOP
START it fixed on dartmouth college , which was UNK and just what the UNK ordered STOP
START the UNK decided to `` UNK '' dartmouth and entered into a UNK with the college trustees over the control of UNK , faculty , and chapel STOP
START for a time there were two UNK on the campus fighting for possession of the student body STOP
START the struggle was resolved in UNK in the supreme court in one of the most UNK cases in our judicial history STOP
START in UNK the lawyers were generally UNK the legal UNK of private contracts and UNK STOP
START a lawyer , hired by the college , was UNK specifically for dartmouth : UNK UNK , class of UNK , made her UNK the dramatic focus of his whole UNK STOP
START in an age of UNK , he was the king of UNK , and both he himself and chief justice marshall were UNK in UNK tears , as uncle UNK reached his UNK climax : STOP
START `` it is , sir , as i have said , a small college , and yet there are those who love it STOP
START '' STOP
START dartmouth is today still a small college -- and still a private one , thanks to UNK UNK STOP
START this is not out of keeping with its UNK , probably the most humble of any in the UNK group STOP
START UNK UNK , a UNK minister , founded the school in UNK , UNK it after the second UNK of dartmouth , its UNK and UNK STOP
START UNK , UNK on the hanover plain , found its great forests and UNK good and with his own hands built the first college hall , a UNK UNK dedicated `` for the education & instruction of youth of the indian UNK in this land in reading , writing & all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and UNK for UNK & UNK children of UNK as well as in all liberal arts and sciences ; ; STOP
START and also of english youth and any others '' STOP
START it was a hardy UNK , and UNK was indeed `` a voice UNK in the UNK '' STOP
START a road had to be UNK through UNK forests between hanover and UNK to permit governor UNK and a company of UNK to attend the first dartmouth UNK in UNK STOP
START the governor and his UNK UNK brought with them a UNK silver UNK which is still one of the UNK UNK of the college STOP
START the UNK on this occasion set a standard for subsequent dartmouth UNK STOP
START a student UNK `` produced tears from a great number of the learned '' even before the UNK was served STOP
START then from the branches of a UNK tree an indian UNK , UNK both the platform and the english language , UNK the UNK in his UNK tongue STOP
START governor UNK contributed an UNK for a barbecue on the green beneath the UNK UNK , and a barrel of UNK was UNK STOP
START the cook got UNK , and president UNK proved to be a man of broad talents by UNK the UNK himself STOP
START future UNK were more UNK perhaps , but the number of graduates increased from the original four at a relatively slow pace STOP
START by the end of the nineteenth century , in UNK , when the big three , columbia , and UNK were UNK centers of learning , dartmouth UNK only UNK STOP
START the UNK , including the beloved dartmouth hall , could barely house two hundred students in UNK fashion STOP
START then in UNK UNK UNK UNK became president and the UNK great UNK began STOP
START he transformed dartmouth from a small new UNK institution into a national college STOP
START by UNK the number of UNK had UNK to UNK STOP
START and at his last UNK , in that year , UNK and dartmouth were UNK by the presence of distinguished academic visitors UNK to the new UNK of the college STOP
START the UNK of UNK , wisconsin , UNK UNK , vermont , brown , columbia , UNK , yale , and harvard and the UNK UNK of harvard and michigan were there STOP
START dartmouth is UNK still a small college today , with approximately UNK hundred UNK STOP
START but it has achieved a UNK of students from almost all the states , and UNK of its UNK come from outside new england STOP
START over UNK different schools are usually represented in each entering class STOP
START only a dozen or so schools send as many as six students , and there are seldom more than fifteen men in any single UNK STOP
START about UNK of the boys now come from public schools STOP
START it is still a college only and not a university ; ; STOP
START it is , in fact , the only college in the UNK group STOP
START however , three distinguished associated graduate schools offer professional UNK -- the dartmouth medical school ( third UNK in the country and founded in UNK ) , the UNK school of engineering , and the UNK UNK school of business administration STOP
START all three are UNK kept small , with a current total UNK of about two hundred STOP
START all three schools UNK their educational programs with that of the UNK college and , like the college proper , place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation for specialized study STOP
START students of the college who are candidates for the UNK and can satisfy the academic requirements of the medical and business schools , may enter either of these associated schools at the beginning of senior year , thus UNK the UNK UNK course in one year STOP
START the UNK school offers a year of UNK study in somewhat the same way , after a boy UNK a UNK engineering STOP
START so dartmouth is moving closer to the others in the UNK group STOP
START it is still , however , the junior member of the league , if not in years at least in the UNK up it has had to do STOP
START it has not been a well-known school for any part of the span the other UNK have enjoyed STOP
START however much UNK has been UNK , the public likes to measure its UNK UNK by the UNK , so , while yale need never give its record a thought again since UNK its UNK UNK to 0 in the season of UNK , dartmouth had to wait until its UNK team of UNK for national recognition STOP
START it has come on with a UNK in more significant areas STOP
START today it UNK certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions might consider somewhat UNK STOP
START but dartmouth UNK its UNK UNK even in its educational attitudes , and , although some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage , they make for UNK copy STOP
START president UNK UNK once proposed to UNK an `` UNK of UNK '' in hanover STOP
START the person who left the UNK there has never been identified STOP
START it was a busy street , UNK near the shopping center , and UNK horses and UNK were often left at the UNK STOP
START there are , of course , many UNK in any case against UNK STOP
START she didn't like her UNK , but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before the crime that could have caused such a UNK UNK STOP
START she had no way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed STOP
START she would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized during her UNK STOP
START if she avoided the train and hired a UNK , the UNK might have recognized her STOP
START if police had checked on her more thoroughly than is indicated , she would be completely eliminated as a suspect STOP
START uncle john UNK morse was the immediate popular suspect STOP
START his sudden UNK appearance at the UNK home was strange in that he did not carry an UNK of UNK with him , although he clearly intended to stay overnight , if not longer STOP
START lizzie stated during the UNK that while her father and uncle were in the sitting room the afternoon before the UNK , she had been disturbed by their UNK and had closed her door , even though it was a very hot day STOP
START it is evident that lizzie did not tell everything she UNK between her father and her uncle morse STOP
START at that time UNK had a young law associate named arthur UNK STOP
START a few years ago , not too long before his death , UNK revealed in a newspaper story that he had always UNK morse of the UNK STOP
START he said morse and UNK had UNK UNK in the house that day , information which must have come from lizzie STOP
START it was obviously the sound of this argument that caused lizzie to close her door STOP
START the new UNK UNK has reported UNK as saying , long after the trial , that if he only knew what UNK said during his conversation with morse , he would have UNK `` UNK '' STOP
START notice , UNK did not say that he would have obtained a conviction in the trial of lizzie UNK STOP
START he said he would have UNK `` UNK '' STOP
START it is known that morse did associate with a group of UNK horse traders who made their headquarters at UNK , a town not far from fall river STOP
START they were a UNK lot and considered to be UNK and UNK characters STOP
START fall river police did go to UNK to see if they could get any information against morse and possibly find an UNK whom he might have hired from among these men STOP
START these officers found no UNK information STOP
START UNK UNK was not as solid as it seemed STOP
START he said he returned from the visit to his UNK on the UNK UNK STOP
START the woman in the house where the UNK was UNK UNK up his story and said she left when he did to shop for her dinner STOP
START fall river is not a UNK town STOP
START the dinner hour there was twelve UNK STOP
START if this woman had delayed until after UNK to start her shopping , she would have had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was UNK at dinner in those days STOP
START it is possible that morse told the woman it was UNK , but it could have been earlier , since she did serve dinner on time STOP
START police did make an attempt to check on UNK UNK STOP
START they UNK the conductor of the UNK morse said he had taken , but the man did not remember morse as a UNK STOP
START questioned further , morse said that there had been four or five priests riding on the same car with him STOP
START the conductor did recall having priests as UNK and this satisfied police , although the conductor also pointed out that in heavily catholic fall river there were priests riding on almost every trip the UNK made , so UNK statement really proved nothing STOP
START we do know that morse left the house before nine o'clock STOP
START bridget UNK she saw him leave through the side door STOP
START morse said UNK let him out and locked the screen door STOP
START from that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked UNK to where his UNK was UNK , more than a mile away STOP
START he met nobody he knew on this walk STOP
START there is no accounting of his movements in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when UNK was killed STOP
START morse UNK that while he was having breakfast in the dining room , UNK told the servant , `` bridget , i want you to wash these windows today '' STOP
START UNK testimony was in direct UNK STOP
START she said it was after she returned from her UNK UNK in the back yard that UNK told her to wash the windows STOP
START this was long after morse had left the house STOP
START UNK knowledge of what UNK told bridget could indicate that he had returned UNK to the house and was UNK there STOP
START he knew the house fairly well , he had been there on two previous visits during the past three or four months alone STOP
START and despite UNK attempts to show that the house was locked up UNK than a UNK , this was not true STOP
START the screen door was UNK for some ten or fifteen minutes while bridget was sick in the back STOP
START it was UNK all the time she was washing windows STOP
START morse could have returned openly while bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room he had occupied STOP
START UNK would not have been UNK if she saw morse with an UNK or UNK in his hand STOP
START he had been to the farm the previous day and he could have said they needed the UNK or UNK at the farm STOP
START UNK would have had no reason to UNK him and he could have approached close enough to her to UNK before she could cry out STOP
START he could have left for UNK street after her murder and made it in plenty of time by using the UNK STOP
START if he took an earlier UNK than the UNK on his return , he could have arrived at the UNK house shortly after UNK came home STOP
START with lizzie in the UNK , the screen door UNK and bridget UNK in her UNK room , he would have had free and easy access to the house STOP
START with the second murder over , he could have left , UNK the weapon in some UNK lot or an abandoned UNK in the neighborhood STOP
START his UNK UNK down the side of the house to a UNK tree , with UNK already gathering in front of the building and UNK UNK the side door , was odd STOP
START there was no close examination of his clothes for UNK , and certainly no scientific test was made of them STOP
START and for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing , a few more UNK on his dark suit may very well have gone UNK STOP
START the motive may have been the mysterious quarrel ; ; STOP
START there was no financial gain for morse in the UNK STOP
START on the other side of the UNK is the fact that he did see his UNK and the woman with whom she was UNK STOP
START the time would have been shortly after the murder of UNK and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior STOP
START he said he had promised UNK to return in time for dinner and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the UNK house STOP
START what did UNK say about bridget UNK as a possible suspect in his UNK essay ? ? STOP
START he wrote : STOP
START `` the police soon UNK to look upon either bridget or UNK as in possession of guilty knowledge STOP
START neither had any interest in the UNK ; ; STOP
START indeed , it was probably to UNK advantage to have UNK UNK alive STOP
START both he and bridget were UNK by lizzie herself '' STOP
START that was his complete discussion of bridget UNK as a possible suspect STOP
START although UNK UNK almost everything lizzie said , and read a UNK purpose into almost everything she did , he UNK accepted her statement about bridget as the whole truth STOP
START he felt nothing further need be said about the servant girl STOP
START the UNK UNK speaks of is not an UNK , but UNK expression of her opinion , as reported in the testimony of assistant UNK UNK STOP
START this officer had asked lizzie if she UNK her uncle morse , and she replied she didn't think he did it because he left the house before the UNK and returned after them STOP
START UNK asked the same question about bridget , and lizzie pointed out that as far as she knew bridget had gone up to her room before her father's murder and came down when she called her STOP
START lizzie , actually , never named any suspect STOP
START she told police about the prospective UNK she had heard UNK with her father some weeks before the UNK , but she said she thought he was from out of town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner STOP
START and , much as she UNK UNK UNK , she also did not UNK him STOP
START at the UNK she was asked specifically whether she knew anybody her father had bad feelings toward , or who had bad feelings toward her father STOP
START she replied , `` i know of one man that has not been friendly with him STOP
START they have not been friendly for years '' STOP
START asked who this was , she named UNK STOP
START her statement certainly was true ; ; STOP
START the press reported the same facts in using UNK interview , but lizzie did not suggest at the UNK that UNK was the UNK STOP
START when i UNK UNK , who as a boy picked up UNK in the UNK yard , i asked if anybody else in the household besides lizzie and morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the UNK STOP
START he said he had not heard of anybody else STOP
START `` how about bridget UNK '' ? ? STOP
START i UNK STOP
START `` oh , she was just the maid there '' , he replied , UNK a hand to indicate how completely UNK she was STOP
START UNK was , of course , UNK the opinion that existed at the time of UNK STOP
START everyone somehow UNK to UNK completely the fact that , as far as we know , there were exactly two people in and about the house at the time of both UNK : lizzie UNK and bridget UNK STOP
START all the officials on the case seem to have been UNK with a similar UNK as far as bridget was concerned , although records in police UNK contain many reports of servants who have UNK their UNK STOP
START true , it is no longer UNK for the UNK to be the UNK in mystery fiction , but we are dealing here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters and situations STOP
START the actions of bridget should be examined , since she was there and opportunity did exist , if only to establish her innocence STOP
START there are also other factors that require closer examination STOP
START the legend as it exists in fall river today always includes the UNK assurance that bridget returned to UNK after the trial with a `` big UNK '' of cash which lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut STOP
START the people who believe and UNK the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points , always to the UNK of lizzie STOP
START if bridget did get any UNK of cash , the last person who would have UNK her for services rendered would have been lizzie UNK STOP
START bridget was born in UNK , one of fourteen children STOP
START she was apparently the pioneer in her family because she had no close relatives in this country at that time STOP
START she worked as a domestic , first in newport for a year , and then in south UNK , pennsylvania , for another year STOP
START she finally settled in fall river and , after being employed for a time by a UNK , was hired by the UNK STOP
START i have previously described how , during the week of the murder , bridget spent the first few hot days UNK and UNK clothes STOP
START her father , james upton , was the upton mentioned by UNK in the famous introduction to the UNK letter as one of those who came into the old custom house to do business with him as the UNK of the port STOP
START a gentleman of the old school , UNK possessed intellectual power , ample means , and UNK , was a devoted christian STOP
START the daughter UNK from his interest in scientific and philosophical subjects STOP
START her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad interests STOP
START there is clear evidence that lucy from childhood had an unusual mind STOP
START she possessed an UNK eye , a UNK memory , and a critical faculty STOP
START when she was nine years old , she wrote a description of a store she had visited STOP
START she named UNK items , and said there were `` many more things which it would take too long to write '' STOP
START an essay on `` freedom '' written at 10 years of age quoted the declaration of independence , the freedom given to slaves in canada , and the views of george washington STOP
START lucy upton was UNK from the salem high school when few colleges , only UNK and UNK , were open to women ; ; STOP
START and she had an UNK for learning that could not be denied STOP
START a picture of her in high school comes from a younger UNK , albert UNK , friend of her brother winslow , and later , like winslow , a noted UNK STOP
START he UNK lucy , as `` a UNK UNK young lady who came regularly through the UNK study hall to join the class in greek in the little UNK room beyond '' STOP
START the study of greek was the distinctive mark of boys UNK to go to college , and lucy upton too expected to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men STOP
START the death of her mother in UNK prevented this STOP
START with four younger children at home , lucy stepped into her mother's role , and even after the brothers and UNK were grown , she was her father's comfort and stay until he died in UNK STOP
START but even so lucy could not give up her intellectual UNK STOP
START when her brother winslow became a student at brown university in UNK , she wrote him about a course in history he was taking under professor UNK : `` what is UNK definition of civilization , and take the world through , is its progress ever UNK , or does it UNK at times ? ? STOP

START also lucy and winslow had a private contest to see which one could make the most words from the letters in `` UNK '' STOP
START who won is not revealed , but UNK daughter UNK says they got up to UNK words STOP
START there was another family interest also STOP
START winslow had musical talents , as had his father before him STOP

START lucy was a UNK part of the household STOP
START moreover , she had physical as well as mental UNK STOP
START winslow , as his UNK UNK and UNK recall , used to UNK her as `` our iron sister '' STOP
START there is reason to suppose that lucy would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about to enter college STOP
START as a matter of fact , albert UNK expressed his conviction that `` her physical strength , her mental power , her UNK interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve her fellow beings '' would have led her `` to a distinguished career UNK the noted women of this country '' STOP
START while in washington , UNK lucy upton held positions in the UNK office , and in the UNK bureau STOP

START miss upton and miss UNK , as a matter of fact , had many UNK in common STOP
START both had eager and UNK minds ; ; STOP
START and both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the development of UNK character and christian UNK STOP
START both loved the UNK , including mountain UNK and UNK riding STOP
START in UNK when the trip to europe and the holy land was arranged for miss UNK , it was miss upton who planned the trip , and `` with rare executive ability '' bore the UNK of `` the entire UNK from beginning to end '' STOP
START so UNK it was physically , with its days of UNK riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing UNK of endurance for both miss UNK and miss upton STOP

START miss upton spoke UNK of the response of spelman graduates and negro friends in helping to raise the fund , and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly needed current expenses STOP
START she spoke also with deep UNK of the many individuals and agencies whose interest and efforts through the years had made the work so UNK in results STOP
START two UNK were recorded : one of UNK under the will of UNK UNK of los angeles ; ; STOP
START and one of UNK under the will of miss UNK UNK of hamilton , new york , a friend from the early days STOP
START miss upton told the trustees that the death of miss UNK was `` the UNK UNK '' the UNK had ever been called upon to bear STOP

START before coming on a visit to spelman in UNK , miss mary had been a successful teacher in UNK , and her position there was held open for her for a considerable period STOP
START but she decided to stay at spelman STOP
START she helped with teaching as well as office work for a few years -- the UNK show that she had classes in UNK , UNK and UNK STOP
START soon the office work claimed all her time STOP
START she was closely associated with the UNK in all their trials and UNK STOP
START quiet and UNK , UNK and calm , she too was a power in the development of the UNK STOP
START miss UNK always used to refer to her as `` sister '' STOP
START she served as secretary in the UNK office for 25 years , and was in charge of correspondence , records , and UNK STOP

START with infinite patience she responded to every call , no matter at what cost to herself , and to her all went , for she was sure to have the needed information or word of UNK STOP
START in a few school districts one finds a UNK between school and job STOP
START in those vocational programs organized with UNK money , there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local UNK on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other STOP
START in these cases a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program , saving a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12 STOP
START the apprentice program will involve further education on a part-time basis , usually at night , perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high school STOP
START these opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such UNK as auto mechanics , UNK , UNK , electrical work , UNK work , and UNK work STOP
START UNK organized vocational programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time job on UNK STOP
START the `` UNK UNK '' program is a part-time UNK program conducted over two school years on a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business UNK STOP
START the `` UNK education '' program UNK in a similar way , with arrangements between the school and UNK in UNK fields STOP
START in both cases the student UNK school UNK and works in a regular job the other half STOP
START he receives UNK for his work STOP
START in a few places cooperative programs between schools and UNK in UNK work have shown the same possibilities for allowing the student , while still in school , to develop skills which are immediately UNK upon UNK STOP
START adult education courses , UNK programs of various UNK -- these are all evidence of a continuing interest of the schools in UNK educational opportunities for UNK youth STOP
START in general , however , it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school , the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next STOP
START if the student drops out of high school , the break with the school is even more complete STOP
START when there is employment opportunity for youth , this arrangement -- or lack of arrangement -- works out quite well STOP
START indeed , in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the UNK UNK school at an early age and went to work STOP
START UNK this has represented a loss to the nation , although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in UNK may have been a wise one STOP
START i make no attempt to measure the UNK satisfaction and material UNK of a man who went to work on UNK from high school and was highly successful in the business which he entered STOP
START he may or may not be `` better off '' than his UNK who went on to a college and professional school STOP
START but in the next decades the nation needs to UNK for the UNK all the potential professional talent STOP
START in a later chapter dealing with the suburban school , i shall discuss the importance of UNK a program for the UNK UNK and highly UNK youth in any high school where he is found STOP
START in the negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and UNK STOP
START high UNK towards higher education must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work STOP
START undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the negro schools STOP
START however , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is UNK STOP
START and the fact remains that there are today few UNK examples of negroes in positions of intellectual leadership STOP
START this is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the northern universities STOP
START quite the contrary , as i can UNK from personal experience as a former university president STOP
START rather we see here another UNK circle STOP
START the absence of successful negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to UNK down enthusiasm among negro youth for academic UNK STOP
START i believe the situation is UNK , but the success stories need to be heavily UNK STOP
START here again we run into the UNK that negroes do not like to be designated as negroes in the press STOP
START how can the UNK circle be broken ? ? STOP
START this is a problem to which leaders of opinion , both negro and white , should UNK far more attention STOP
START it is at least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break down UNK of UNK in the south STOP
START vocational education STOP
START i should like to UNK four points i made in my first report with respect to vocational education STOP
START first and UNK , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic program for UNK STOP
START second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more than half the UNK time in those years ; ; STOP
START however , for slow UNK and prospective UNK these courses ought to begin earlier STOP
START third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those UNK are UNK interested in the work ; ; STOP
START they realize the UNK of what they are learning to their future UNK , and this sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they are studying at the same time STOP
START fourth , the type of vocational training programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general UNK STOP
START this last point is important because if high school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of UNK UNK STOP
START vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a UNK skill becomes just another school `` UNK '' for those whose interest in their studies has begun to UNK STOP
START those who , because of population UNK and the UNK desire of UNK to train their own employees , would limit vocational education to general rather than specific skills ought to bear in mind the importance of UNK in any kind of school experience STOP
START i have been using the word `` vocational '' as a UNK would at first sight think it should be used STOP
START i UNK to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls STOP
START these courses develop skills other than those we think of when we use the UNK `` academic '' STOP
START practically all of these practical skills are of such a nature that a degree of UNK can be obtained in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at once on the basis of the skill STOP
START they are in this sense skills UNK immediately on UNK from high school STOP
START to be sure , in UNK work and in the building UNK , the first job must be often on an apprentice basis , but two years of UNK vocational training UNK the young man thus to UNK one year of apprentice status STOP
START similarly , a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of UNK and the use of UNK machines and who is able to get a job at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community college or UNK school STOP
START of course , it can be argued that an ability to write english correctly and with some degree of UNK is a UNK skill STOP
START so , too , is the mathematical competence of a college graduate who has UNK in mathematics STOP
START in a sense almost all high school and college courses could be considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student in his UNK ( which may be a profession ) will be called upon to use some of the skills developed and the competence obtained STOP
START in spite of the UNK of one type of course into another , i believe it is useful to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses STOP
START perhaps a course in UNK might be regarded as the exception which UNK the rule STOP
START today many college bound students try to take a course in personal UNK , as they feel a certain degree of UNK of this skill is almost essential for one who UNK to do academic work in college and a professional school STOP
START most of our largest cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools STOP
START in this respect , public education in the large cities UNK from education in the smaller cities and UNK school districts STOP
START the neighborhood high schools are not , strictly speaking , comprehensive schools , because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational or technical high school instead of the local school STOP
START indeed , one school UNK in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high school for the senior high schools in his city , because these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs STOP
START he UNK to UNK such schools as `` general '' high schools STOP
START the suburban high school , it is worth noting , also is not a widely comprehensive high school because of the absence of vocational programs STOP
START the reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community STOP
START therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high school described in my first report STOP
START the separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities must be UNK as permanent institutions STOP
START by and large their programs are UNK connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system STOP
START it is not often realized to what degree certain UNK are in many communities closed areas of employment , except for a UNK few STOP
START one has to talk UNK with some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a boy cannot just say , `` i want to be a UNK '' , and then , by doing good work , find a job STOP
START it is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation STOP
START two stories will illustrate what i have in mind STOP
START one vocational UNK in a city vocational school , speaking of his course in a certain field , said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside of the city STOP
START in the city , he said , the waiting list for those who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside track he can't get in STOP
START in a far distant part of the united states , i was talking to an UNK about a boy who in the UNK grade was doing special work STOP
START `` what does he have in mind to do when he graduates '' ? ? STOP
START `` oh , UNK be a UNK '' , came the answer STOP
START `` but isn't it almost impossible to get into the union '' ? ? STOP
START i asked STOP
START `` UNK have no difficulty '' , i was told STOP
START `` he has very good UNK '' STOP
START in my view , there should be a school which offers significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city STOP
START UNK these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest STOP
START an excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high school is the UNK vocational high school in chicago STOP
START located in a bad UNK area now UNK UNK , this school and its program are especially UNK to the vocational aims of its students STOP
START hardly a window has been broken since UNK first was opened ( and UNK in schools is a major problem in many UNK areas ) STOP
START i discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were negroes STOP
START they were learning UNK as diverse as UNK UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK making , auto mechanics , and UNK mechanics STOP
START the physical facilities at UNK are impressive , but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils STOP
START the UNK seed is the most important UNK food in the world STOP
START in the united states , where half of the world crop is grown , UNK are processed for their UNK oil STOP
START the UNK from UNK processing goes mainly into animal UNK STOP
START UNK are UNK processed into a remarkable number of food products in the UNK STOP

START in western europe and north america , where the level of economic development is higher , grains and other seed products furnish less than one-third of the food UNK STOP
START rather , meat and UNK , sugar , and dairy products are the main sources of UNK , protein , oils , and UNK STOP
START people depend less on seeds for foods in UNK , new UNK , and UNK , where extensive UNK lands support sheep or cattle , and the consumption of meat is high STOP
START UNK for livestock took about UNK of the world's cereal crop in UNK STOP
START most of the grain is fed to UNK and dairy cows and lesser amounts to beef cattle and UNK STOP
START about UNK percent of the corn used in the united states is fed to animals STOP

START `` range delivery '' meant that the UNK , after UNK the UNK ranch records and UNK his UNK for UNK , paid for what the UNK claimed to own , then rode out and tried to find it STOP
START when a UNK said that a man had `` good cow sense '' , he meant to pay UNK a high UNK STOP
START no matter by what name cattle were called , there was no UNK that they not only saved texas from financial UNK , but went far toward UNK from a UNK vast UNK of the northwest STOP
START 21 UNK a wide loop STOP
START the first use of the word `` UNK '' was as a UNK for `` UNK '' , UNK an established term for any person who was active , UNK , and UNK in any enterprise STOP
START again it was used as the title for the UNK UNK , and when the order was given to go out and `` UNK the UNK '' , it meant for UNK to go out and herd 'em in STOP
START eventually UNK the UNK was spoken of as `` UNK UNK '' , and the UNK was called the `` UNK UNK '' STOP
START later , the word became almost exclusively applied to a cow UNK , UNK from the days of the UNK when UNK were paid by their UNK to `` get out and UNK a few UNK '' STOP
START it was john who found the lion UNK STOP
START he found them near the UNK of a UNK that had been killed the night before , and he UNK once , nose to the ground , hair shooting up along his back , as it did when he was after lion or bear , and then he UNK his head and UNK , and the pack joined in , all heads high , and jones knew it was a hot trail STOP
START he UNK the UNK UNK and let john lead him straight toward the nearby black UNK mountain STOP
START this mountain was known as the black reef and it rose almost UNK for about two hundred feet , UNK with UNK , top covered with UNK UNK and UNK and tall grass STOP
START on the south it ended sharply as though the UNK had been cut off there suddenly STOP
START UNK and ulyate had started the day together while jones followed the dogs , and means and UNK had taken another route , and now , with the discovery of the fresh trail still unknown to him , ulyate UNK in , in the UNK of the reef and pointed STOP
START UNK UNK his field glasses STOP
START `` that's the colonel '' , he said , `` but i can't see the dogs '' STOP
START as they watched , jones rode straight for the reef STOP
START then they picked up the smaller black UNK on the plain in front of him STOP
START the dogs were working a trail -- lion ? ? STOP
START UNK ? ? STOP
START the pack had made a UNK to the north , UNK back toward the reef , and UNK and ulyate could hear them UNK STOP
START UNK got off and UNK up some dry grass that grew in UNK between the UNK and UNK it in a UNK and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring UNK and means and the rest of the party STOP
START `` not yet '' , UNK ulyate STOP
START jones came toward them fast , now , along the southern UNK of the reef , and the dogs could be heard plainly , old john with his grand UNK voice outstanding above the others STOP
START there was UNK , too , also a veteran of the north UNK , and UNK and the UNK from a pack of english UNK , and a UNK from a london pound , and UNK , a UNK STOP
START a UNK pack , chosen for effectiveness , not beauty STOP
START jones was UNK close behind them UNK down , UNK them on STOP
START `` light it '' ! ! STOP
START ulyate said , and UNK UNK a match to the UNK of grass , UNK on it and UNK UNK out STOP
START he UNK green UNK on it , and a thin blue column of smoke rose STOP
START `` that will UNK the UNK and tell the colonel where we are '' STOP
START two quick UNK UNK STOP
START then there was a UNK of wild UNK and UNK STOP
START then the heavy UNK of a lion STOP
START UNK and ulyate looked at each other and began to UNK toward the sound STOP
START it came from the top of the reef not half a mile away STOP
START at the base of the UNK UNK , they left their horses and UNK on foot STOP
START the route was UNK with rugged UNK , UNK and UNK , so UNK UNK that when UNK lost sight of ulyate and called , ulyate answered from ten feet away STOP
START UNK country to meet a lion in face to face STOP
START ulyate and UNK UNK on toward the sound of the UNK of the dogs and the UNK UNK of the lion , till they came , out of breath , to the UNK , and UNK through the branches of a UNK , this is what ulyate saw : jones who had apparently ( and actually had ) UNK up the nearly UNK UNK , sitting UNK on his horse within forty feet of a UNK young UNK , who was UNK on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him , while the dogs UNK around her STOP
START ulyate drew back with a start , and put finger to UNK , almost afraid to move or UNK UNK it set her off , `` the dogs have got her UNK STOP
START UNK just the other side of that UNK '' ! ! STOP
START and when they had drawn back a step he added : `` jones is sitting on his horse right in front of her STOP
START why she doesn't charge him , i don't know STOP
START and he UNK even got a knife on him STOP
START he couldn't get away from her in this kind of ground STOP
START careful , don't UNK her '' STOP
START jones had been about a hundred and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the reef STOP
START she was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when she saw him she rose to full height and UNK , opening her mouth wide , UNK her tail , and UNK at the rock with both UNK in UNK , as much as to say : `` how dare you UNK me in my sacred UNK '' ? ? STOP
START intuition told him , however , that she was tired and UNK from the run up the reef and would not charge , yet STOP
START he moved forward to within UNK feet of her , being careful , because he knew the female is less UNK than the male STOP
START ( in the UNK at UNK he had been shown the UNK of UNK big game UNK killed hunting the animals he was attempting to UNK STOP
START of the UNK , seventeen had been killed by UNK , and eleven out of the seventeen by UNK STOP
START ) she UNK UNK but intuition told him , again , that she was UNK , and he could see that half her attention was UNK by the dogs STOP
START he UNK the UNK STOP
START it was falling over her head when a branch of a UNK caught it and it fell in front of her on the rock STOP
START even then , if she took one step forward he could catch her STOP
START but john UNK her rear end -- one UNK rear end was as good as another to john , africa , UNK no matter -- and she changed ends and took a UNK at john , but he UNK back STOP
START jones then UNK his UNK and UNK again , this time UNK her on the back but UNK to UNK her STOP
START she UNK and faced him , UNK UNK , and ulyate , watching through the leaves , could not understand why she did not charge and UNK him , because he wouldn't have much of a chance of getting away , in that thick growth , but she seemed just a trace UNK ; ; STOP
START while jones , on the other hand , appeared perfectly UNK and ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer STOP
START from the UNK point of view , this strange UNK on the back of another UNK , UNK out with its long thin UNK , very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with STOP
START but now she UNK lower to the rock STOP
START her UNK changed to a UNK STOP
START her tail no longer UNK STOP
START although she appeared more UNK and UNK , jones knew she was growing more dangerous STOP
START she was UNK and could mount a charge STOP
START just the tip of her tail was moving as she UNK , and she was UNK lightly up and down with her UNK feet STOP
START at this moment , UNK and means arrived , UNK through the UNK with their horses , and UNK her , and she ran off a short distance and UNK into a UNK between two UNK STOP
START the dogs followed her and she killed three and badly wounded old john STOP
START `` UNK got to get her out of there '' ! ! STOP
START jones UNK , `` or UNK kill 'em all STOP
START bring me the UNK '' STOP
START for such an emergency he had included UNK UNK UNK as part of their equipment STOP
START lighting one he UNK it into the UNK , and the UNK left off UNK the dogs and UNK STOP
START `` UNK she a beauty , though '' ? ? STOP
START called out means as she ran STOP
START `` don't you go a step UNK her than i do '' , jones UNK , `` and if you do , go at a run so you'll have momentum '' ! ! STOP
START for two hours they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of the reef , trying to UNK her onto the plain where they could get a good throw STOP
START but she UNK to the UNK and brush , and the day UNK away STOP
START it was hot STOP
START the dogs were tired STOP
START the men were tired too STOP
START it was the story of the UNK fight all over again STOP
START and the sun was beginning to go down STOP
START if dark came they would lose her STOP
START `` i'll get a UNK '' , jones said finally , `` and i'll UNK a UNK over her head '' ! ! STOP
START at this moment she was UNK in a UNK UNK UNK down the reef STOP
START ulyate made no comment but his face showed what he thought of UNK UNK over UNK heads with UNK , and of course these were the UNK of fifty years ago , not the UNK ones of today , and this one was angry , with good reason STOP
START UNK , too , UNK STOP
START `` it won't work , colonel '' STOP
START `` just the same UNK try it '' STOP
START but without waiting for them to try it , she scattered the dogs and shot down the reef and out across the plain STOP
START john led the UNK after her and the other dogs UNK out behind , many of them UNK blood STOP
START john himself was UNK and UNK from head to tail , but he was in this fight to the finish , running almost as strongly now as in the morning STOP
START she took UNK on a tongue of land extending into a UNK , UNK at the base of a UNK tree , and waited for them to come up STOP
START she had chosen the spot well STOP
START with the UNK on three sides , she could be approached only along the tongue of land STOP
START `` careful , now '' , jones UNK STOP
START means tried her first STOP
START very slowly he UNK his UNK bay UNK , UNK closer , watching for a chance to throw , but ready to UNK and run , UNK UNK about his head , horse UNK UNK under him , but the UNK was UNK and responded and was not UNK by the close UNK of the lion STOP
START they tell you horses go UNK at the sight or UNK of a bear or a lion , but these didn't STOP
START means UNK closer STOP
START she UNK UNK STOP
START means UNK and UNK on STOP
START again she UNK , and again he UNK STOP
START the UNK was UNK to her STOP
START with a UNK UNK , it could get into gear STOP
START however nothing on four legs was supposed to be UNK than a lion over a short distance , unless it was a UNK STOP
START she charged STOP
START means UNK and UNK STOP
START for thirty yards she gained rapidly STOP
START she was UNK and within one more bound would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay , but -- and here jones and UNK and ulyate were holding breath for all they were worth -- she never quite caught up that last bound STOP
START means held steady one UNK ahead of her STOP
START then gradually he began to pull away STOP
START a western UNK had UNK an african lion , from a standing start STOP
START UNK showed later that UNK been about six feet from means STOP
START of course the factor of head start made all the difference STOP
START how much head start ? ? STOP
START no one knew exactly STOP
START that was the whole question STOP
START enough , was the answer STOP
START the UNK quickly changed front , when she saw she couldn't catch means , and made for jones STOP
START as she had done with means , she gained rapidly at first , but then UNK began to draw away STOP
START UNK in the few UNK yards of head start was the determining point STOP
START when jones too drew away , she returned to a UNK UNK in the neck of land running into the UNK , UNK low and waited as before STOP
START this new position , however , gave the UNK a better chance STOP
START there was room to make a quick UNK past the UNK and throw as you went STOP
START so : means UNK around on the north side of her , jones moved in from the south STOP
START UNK his UNK and UNK he attracted her attention STOP
START he succeeded almost too well , because once she rose as if to charge , and he half UNK his horse -- he was within fifty feet -- but she UNK back STOP
START from behind her means shot forward at a run STOP
START UNK began UNK , `` wait , wait -- the UNK UNK '' ! ! STOP
START but means kept on STOP
START he UNK by within twenty feet of her , UNK her around the neck , but a UNK neck is short and thick and with a quick twist she UNK the UNK off STOP
START the missionary obligation to UNK the UNK to all the world was once left to UNK individuals and voluntary societies STOP
START but the time came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was looked upon as UNK in its essential life STOP
START the christian education of children , too , was once hardly more than a UNK , but the day came when a congregation that did not assume full UNK of a church school was thought of as UNK in its duty STOP
START the most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each UNK and a few UNK UNK STOP
START most UNK and UNK , even though they believe it to be important , assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the UNK of their UNK STOP
START they may even UNK it from their minds as something that concerns only the `` UNK UNK boys '' , as someone has UNK them , who like to go to national and international UNK , and have expense accounts that permit them to do so STOP
START as long as this point of view UNK , the ecumenical movement will be UNK and UNK STOP
START the next stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community STOP
START progress will take place far less through what is done in any `` UNK conference '' of the national council or the world council , or even in offices of the UNK boards , than through what happens in the communities where christian people live together as neighbors STOP
START the front line of advance is where UNK and UNK congregations of different traditions exist side by side STOP
START until they see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their own attitudes , programs , and relationships , it will have an inevitable aspect of UNK STOP
START as things now stand , there is a UNK UNK between the unity in christ which we UNK in ecumenical meetings and the UNK UNK of most congregations on any main street in the nation STOP
START the ecumenical congregation STOP
START the UNK of ecumenical advance is an even more UNK matter than the relation between congregations in the same community STOP
START the decisive question is what happens within each congregation and , finally , in the minds and hearts of the individual members STOP
START it is here that the local and ecumenical must meet STOP
START it is here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical STOP
START it has become almost UNK to say that the ecumenical movement must be `` carried down to the grass roots '' STOP
START this way of describing the matter is unfortunate STOP
START it implies two UNK STOP
START one is that whatever is ecumenical has to do with some over-all organization at `` the top '' and needs only to be understood at the so-called `` lower levels '' STOP
START the truth , however , is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its own true character as an integral unit of the whole people of god throughout the world STOP
START the other UNK is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension and its UNK UNK , now UNK by many national leaders , can be UNK to all congregations STOP
START however needed this may be , the fundamental problem is not information but active UNK to the total mission of the church of christ in the world STOP
START the basic unit in the church , of whatever UNK UNK , is always the congregation STOP
START it is hardly possible to emphasize this too much STOP
START most people do not realize that the congregation , as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face , personally sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience in daily relationships with one another , is unique STOP
START the idea that it is a feature of all religions is entirely UNK STOP
START the jewish UNK UNK a parallel to the christian congregation , but UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , although they have sacred UNK , priests , spiritual UNK , and places of prayer , do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and love STOP
START their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an UNK or a UNK rather than that of a continuing social group with a distinctive kind of fellowship STOP
START how far the fellowship in most local churches falls below what the new testament means by UNK ! ! STOP
START what is now called christian fellowship is often little more than the social UNK of having a UNK time with the kind of people one likes STOP
START the UNK of acts and of the UNK means sharing in a common relation to christ STOP
START it is an experience of a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate UNK of christ in his people STOP
START as UNK UNK puts it , `` our community with one another consists solely in what christ has done to both of us '' STOP
START this may mean having fellowship in the church with people with whom , on the level of merely human UNK , we might prefer not to have any association at all STOP
START there is a vast difference between the community of UNK which the new testament describes and the community of UNK found in the average church building STOP
START whenever a congregation really sees itself as a unit in the universal church , in vital relation with the whole body of christ and UNK in his mission to the world , a necessary UNK of the ecumenical movement has been laid STOP
START the UNK of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists STOP
START the local and the ecumenical are one STOP
START of course , the perspective of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the people of god will always be different from the perspective of those who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a particular place STOP
START each viewpoint is valid if it is UNK related to the other STOP
START neither is adequate if it stands alone STOP
START our difficulty UNK when either viewpoint UNK out the other STOP
START and this is what all too often happens STOP
START UNK UNK STOP
START a little UNK UNK of this truth is UNK by an incident related by professor UNK UNK at the end of the second world war STOP
START with great difficulty he made his way from his native UNK to UNK to UNK his contacts as a member of the UNK committee for the world council of churches STOP
START when he had the UNK of breaking his UNK , his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new ones STOP
START they were UNK STOP
START he often spoke of them as his `` ecumenical '' glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is required in the church STOP
START it is , he said , a UNK vision , which can see both the UNK and the distant and keep a christian in right relation to both STOP
START as things stand now , the local and the ecumenical tend to compete with each other STOP
START on the one hand , there are UNK who are so UNK by the crises of the church in its encounter with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church is doing in their own town STOP
START they do not escape the UNK into which charles dickens UNK UNK as falling STOP
START her concern for the UNK of UNK was so intense that she quite UNK and UNK her son UNK ! ! STOP
START likewise , the UNK may become so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the UNK state in east germany , the UNK situation of the church in revolutionary china , and the UNK of the church over UNK in south africa that he UNK close contact with the UNK church in its UNK but indispensable ministry of worship , UNK service and UNK , and christian UNK for a UNK group of individuals STOP
START on the other hand , many a UNK is so absorbed in UNK to the UNK , personal needs of individuals in his congregation that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social responsibility and world mission STOP
START as a result , they go on thinking of the church , with UNK and UNK satisfaction , only in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families STOP
START it would hardly be an UNK to say that ninety per cent of the energy of most churches -- whether in terms of finance or spiritual concern -- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the members STOP
START the UNK lives for itself rather than for the community or the world STOP
START the gap between the ecumenical perspective and the UNK perspective appears most UNK in a church in any of our comfortable suburbs STOP
START it is UNK successful according to all conventional standards STOP
START it is growing in numbers STOP
START its people are UNK friends STOP
START it has a beautiful UNK STOP
START its preaching and its music give UNK of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain STOP
START it provides UNK care for the sick and troubled STOP
START it helps children grow up with at least a UNK UNK with the bible STOP
START it draws young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the church from generation to generation STOP
START and it is easy for the ecumenical UNK to lose sight of how basic all this is STOP
START but what is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as christians in the world ? ? STOP
START all too often its conception of UNK ministry and UNK care includes no responsibility for them in their relation to issues of the most desperate UNK for the life of mankind STOP
START it is not UNK them to UNK the racial tensions of today with the mind of christ STOP
START it is not helping them face the moral crisis involved in the use of nuclear energy STOP
START it is not making them sensitive to the UNK level of much of our economic and industrial life STOP
START it is raising no disturbing question as to what christian UNK means for the relationship of the UNK nation in the world to UNK UNK peoples STOP
START it is not developing an awareness of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young churches emerge in asia and africa STOP
START to put it UNK , many a local church is giving its members only what they UNK want STOP
START it is not disturbing them by thoughts of their christian responsibility in relation to the world STOP
START we shall not make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not merely as a UNK of comfort and peace but as a base of christian witness and mission to the world STOP
START there is a humorous but UNK story about a UNK who owned a large UNK of texas and who wanted to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant community STOP
START he built a school and a UNK , then a recreation center and an UNK STOP
START UNK to fill the only remaining lack , he selected the best site on the ranch for a chapel and UNK no expense in UNK it STOP
START a UNK to the beautiful little building UNK , `` do you belong to this church , UNK '' ? ? STOP
START `` why , no , UNK '' , he replied , `` this church belongs to me '' ! ! STOP
START the story reflects the way too many people feel STOP
START as long as the congregation UNK the church as `` our '' church , or the minister UNK of it as `` my '' church , just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant advance STOP
START there must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs not to us but to christ , and that it is his purpose , not our own interests and UNK , that determines what it is to be and do STOP
START local UNK of the whole STOP
START a local church which UNK its function to be entirely that of UNK to the conscious desires and concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an extra , not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church STOP
START it would UNK be greatly UNK to be told that in UNK to be ecumenical it is really UNK to be the church of christ STOP
START yet the truth , according to the new testament , is that every local church has its existence only by being the UNK of the whole church in that particular place STOP
START yet a crowd came out to see some fresh UNK from the city try to match the boys from the neighboring UNK ; ; STOP
START and UNK and UNK and UNK UNK kept gathering all morning , until the edges of the field were UNK thick and small boys kept UNK out on the playing field to make fun of the visitors -- whose UNK was a formidable looking young man with the only baseball UNK STOP
START this was a UNK fought game , carrying almost as much UNK as a UNK fight , with no UNK UNK between the teams except the formal UNK that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and UNK on UNK that went into the crowd STOP
START every pitch in the game brought forth a UNK from the UNK audience and every fly ball the visitors dropped ( and because their right UNK was still a little UNK from drink , they dropped many ) called forth UNK of UNK STOP
START at one point in the game when the UNK old man in UNK who was acting as UNK got in the way of a thrown ball and took it UNK in the UNK , he lay there UNK while players and UNK UNK over whether the ball was `` dead '' or the base UNK were free to score STOP
START this was typical of such games , which were UNK played to win and practically never UNK up in an expression of good fellowship STOP
START when the visitors , after losing this game , rode along the village streets toward home , the UNK who could keep UNK of them for a moment or two UNK UNK , `` you UNK of UNK ! ! STOP
START UNK back home ! ! STOP
START you UNK '' ! ! STOP
START baseball was surely the national game in those days , even though professional baseball may have been merely a business STOP
START radio UNK had not begun and most UNK of baseball attended the games near home , in the town park or a UNK , with perhaps two or three trips to the city each season to see the UNK or the UNK or the indians or the red UNK STOP
START young men in school could look forward to playing ball for money in a dozen different places , even if they failed to make the major UNK STOP
START nearly any UNK with a UNK of skill might find a UNK UNK him in the three i league , or the UNK league , or the UNK UNK league , or the fast eastern league , if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city UNK that UNK everywhere STOP
START even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams , sponsored by UNK and UNK merchants or department stores , that played two or three times a week throughout the summer , usually in the cool of the evening , before an earnest and partisan audience who did not UNK a quarter each , or even more , to be dropped into a UNK when the game was half over STOP
START UNK ruth , of course , was UNK hero , and everyone knew him , even though relatively few ever saw him play ball STOP
START his face was always in the newspapers , sometimes in UNK that seemed nearly as large as life STOP
START as the UNK grew older , and as radio UNK of baseball games began to involve more and more people daily in the UNK of the UNK , the great UNK ( always led by UNK ruth ) UNK the game so that UNK were nearly of no account STOP
START boys no longer UNK learning to UNK and even school UNK UNK to `` UNK up '' on a UNK as UNK UNK and the famous UNK of another day had done STOP
START other UNK UNK with more or less UNK in the news and a few even UNK to dream of matching ruth , who was still called UNK by all his friends , or UNK or UNK by those who UNK to UNK him ( UNK was the name of the ball UNK he liked the least ) and who called most of the world `` UNK '' STOP
START UNK UNK was given the UNK UNK , and he ran ruth a close race in home runs STOP
START but the UNK never UNK and UNK was no match for ruth in `` color '' -- which is sometimes a UNK word for UNK behavior on and off the field STOP
START ruth was a UNK boy still , but he was in every way a great ball UNK who was out to win the game and occasionally UNK a UNK bone to do it STOP
START a few professional baseball players UNK UNK , with the UNK of the press , so that they might see their names in big black UNK , along with UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , and the prince of UNK STOP
START one who , for a time , succeeded best and was still the UNK of all was charles arthur UNK , who called himself , in the newspapers , art the great , or the great UNK STOP
START it was his UNK that he could beat everybody at anything , but especially at fighting , and he once took on the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his UNK STOP
START he was given to public UNK and to acting the UNK on the UNK ; ; STOP
START and a UNK asserted he had found a pair of UNK UNK in UNK UNK once when he had occasion to UNK the great first UNK for some forgotten reason STOP
START ( this made a UNK named UNK wonder in UNK if art had UNK this UNK when he UNK his manager STOP
START ) the UNK fact about this young man , who was barely of age when he broke into UNK baseball , was that he really was a better ball UNK than he was given credit for being -- never so good as he claimed , and always an UNK to his UNK , but a good steady UNK when he could fight down the UNK to UNK on his skills or cut up in public STOP
START in his minor way charles arthur UNK was perhaps more typical of his era than ruth was , for he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these UNK UNK days for the sake of UNK space in the newspapers STOP
START there were others who UNK UNK and refused to come down ; ; STOP
START or who UNK strange objects , like live fish ; ; STOP
START or who UNK to set records for remaining UNK on a dance floor , with or without a partner ; ; STOP
START or who UNK to down full UNK of UNK UNK without UNK for breath STOP
START one young man , UNK to the point of UNK by liquor and the excitement of the moment , performed a perfect UNK UNK out of the stands at the yale bowl during the UNK UNK game , UNK UNK on his head on the concrete UNK below , and died at once STOP
START but the UNK were not all UNK and a UNK after recognition STOP
START the business of baseball began to UNK along with other UNK , and UNK -- thanks partly to george UNK UNK spectacular efforts each season to run his salary higher and higher -- UNK too STOP
START while fifty years before , albert UNK UNK , secretary of the chicago ball club of the national league , could write UNK to the manager of the UNK club and request a UNK of one hundred dollars for a baseball game in august , in this golden era a game at the UNK UNK might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate STOP
START and while less than ten years earlier the UNK black UNK -- all of them top UNK in their positions -- had UNK for UNK charles UNK at UNK ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to UNK hundred dollars a year , stars now were asking ten thousand dollars , twenty thousand dollars , yes , even fifty thousand dollars a season STOP
START the greatest team of this period was UNK the new york UNK , bought by UNK millions and made into a ball club by men named UNK UNK and miller UNK STOP

START radio , however , so increased the interest of women in the game that it was hardly necessary even to have `` UNK days '' any longer to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home STOP

START our discussion does not UNK all the identity crises UNK by UNK , but is intended to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical UNK for studying unwed mothers STOP
START we hope thereby to emphasize that , from a psychological UNK , the UNK prevention of UNK is a continuous long-term process involving the UNK of the female from UNK through adolescence STOP
START UNK a series of UNK stages that begin in the individual's UNK and end in his old age , UNK has indicated that the UNK is faced with a series of identity crises STOP
START the successful and positive resolution of these crises during adolescence involves an UNK principle -- during adolescence , the individual's positive UNK in each area of identity crisis depend , to a considerable degree , on his already having resolved preliminary and UNK identity crises during his UNK , childhood , and early adolescence STOP
START within UNK UNK , the UNK UNK behavior -- in this case , her unwed UNK -- reflects her `` identity diffusion '' , or her inability to UNK these various identity crises UNK STOP
START the UNK experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective UNK diffusion STOP
START time perspective -- the ability to plan for the future and to UNK UNK immediate wants in order to achieve long-range objectives -- is more easily developed if , from UNK on , the individual has been able to UNK on and trust people and the world in which she lives STOP
START UNK has noted that , unless this trust developed early , the time UNK experienced , in varying degree and temporarily , by all UNK ( as a result of their UNK the more immediate UNK of wants during childhood , while not yet having fully accepted the long-range planning required by UNK ) may develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion STOP
START experience of this time diffusion UNK from a sense of UNK UNK to a feeling of desperate UNK to act immediately STOP
START these UNK UNK in time diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported in earlier chapters STOP
START some of these mothers , apparently feeling a desperate UNK , made , on the UNK of the moment , commitments , in love and sex , that would have UNK consequences STOP
START others displayed UNK UNK and UNK to any decision about the past or the future STOP
START for many of these unwed mothers , the data on their family life and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources of their basic UNK of their parents in particular and of the world in general STOP
START however , as UNK has noted , the individual's failure to develop preliminary UNK during UNK and childhood need not be UNK UNK with respect to a given area of identity diffusion in his ( or her ) adolescence STOP
START and , as shown in chapter 6 , , some UNK females originally developed such trust only during their adolescence , through the aid of , and their identification with , UNK STOP
START in the specific case of time diffusion , we must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of UNK when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by most ( if not all ) UNK in our society , and with the failure of the UNK period to provide opportunities for developing trust STOP
START the UNK experiences two closely related crises : UNK UNK identity consciousness ; ; STOP
START and UNK UNK identity STOP
START a sense of UNK and the freedom to experiment with different roles , or confidence in one's own unique behavior as an alternative to UNK conformity , is more easily developed during adolescence if , during early childhood , the individual was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some autonomy STOP
START however , if the child has been constantly surrounded , during UNK and early school age , by UNK groups ; ; STOP
START UNK with the UNK of group acceptance and group standards ; ; STOP
START and allowed little initiative in early play and work patterns -- then in adolescence her normal degree of UNK , sensitivity , and UNK with whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable , will be UNK STOP
START her UNK UNK to and UNK against suggestions and UNK by anyone except UNK friends during adolescence are the UNK , in her adolescence , of her having been UNK in childhood to feel UNK , if not guilt , for UNK to UNK in a manner acceptable to , and judged by , the performance of her UNK and UNK UNK friends STOP
START to be different is to UNK UNK and doubt ; ; STOP
START and it is better to be UNK and UNK by one's parents , who already consider one different and difficult to understand , than by one's UNK , who are also UNK a similar UNK for and denial of adult status STOP
START the attitudes of some unwed mothers quoted in chapter 2 , , revealed both considerable UNK with being accepted by others and a marked absence of UNK STOP
START many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a UNK means of UNK acceptance from and identification with others ; ; STOP
START but very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need to be UNK with more UNK and stable identification of and with one's self STOP
START another identity crisis UNK the UNK involves anticipation of achievement UNK STOP
START the UNK capacity to UNK achievement and to exercise the UNK necessary to complete tasks successfully depends on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy , initiative , and UNK during childhood STOP
START the UNK process involves the individual's UNK UNK a sense of dignity and achievement resulting from having completed tasks , having kept commitments , and having created something ( however small or simple -- even a UNK dress of one's own design rather than in the design `` it ought to be '' ) STOP
START these childhood experiences are sources of the UNK that the UNK needs , for UNK with many roles , and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of UNK and UNK her skills and abilities STOP
START if she has not had such experiences , the UNK normal UNK degree of UNK will be UNK STOP
START she may well be UNK by it when she is confronted with present and future alternatives -- e.g, whether to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of a UNK ; ; STOP
START whether to stay UNK dependent on her parents or help support herself while attending school ; ; STOP
START whether to pursue a college education or a job after high school ; ; STOP
START and whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study STOP
START UNK has noted that , as this UNK UNK , it may result in a `` UNK of UNK '' STOP
START this UNK may be expressed in the UNK starting -- and never UNK -- many jobs , tasks , and courses of study ; ; STOP
START and in the fact that she bases her decisions about work , college , UNK , and studies on what others are doing , rather than on her own sense of identity with given skills , abilities , likes , and UNK STOP
START the absence , during her childhood and early adolescence , of experiences in developing the UNK to complete tasks within her ability -- experiences that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement -- and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression , both tend in her adolescence to UNK her of the UNK to UNK and to fail occasionally in UNK STOP
START the comments made by some unwed mothers ( quoted in chapter 2 ) ) reflect this UNK of UNK STOP
START they attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions others made ; ; STOP
START they accepted a job primarily because it was available , convenient , and paid reasonably STOP
START these things both express and , at the same time , continue contributing to , their identity diffusion in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and UNK STOP
START as their identity diffusion increased , they became more UNK to UNK UNK in love and sexual affairs STOP
START these affairs temporarily relieved the UNK of school or work activities containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of UNK , no sense of dignity derived from a job well done STOP
START childhood experiences in learning work and UNK habits within a context of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance for the prevention of UNK STOP
START the UNK from case UNK presented above confirm this significance , though through different UNK of experience STOP
START for example , some unwed mothers had had no work experiences , household UNK , and responsibilities during childhood and early adolescence ; ; STOP
START they UNK occupied their UNK hours in UNK for something exciting and UNK STOP
START sex was both STOP
START on the other hand , some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility imposed on them at an early age , and had thus had so little freedom or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative , that their work and responsibilities became UNK and UNK UNK -- to be UNK and UNK against through fun and experimentation with UNK sexual behavior STOP
START the UNK also faces the identity crisis that UNK has UNK ideological UNK UNK of ideals STOP
START in discussing the ways this crisis is UNK to UNK for the prevention of UNK , we shall again UNK UNK concept on our data STOP
START UNK have a UNK tendency to UNK ideas and values , to perceive things as `` UNK '' , black or white -- UNK of meaning are relatively UNK STOP
START this tendency is , perhaps , most clearly revealed in the literature on religious UNK and experiences of UNK STOP
START UNK has UNK that such ideological UNK temporarily UNK their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly changing and UNK UNK between childhood and UNK STOP
START it provides identification -- with an idea , a value , a cause that cuts through , or even UNK , the multiple and UNK UNK of their passage from child to adult , and permits their UNK and UNK expression of emotion STOP
START the positive development , during adolescence , of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with increasing independence , and to identify UNK either with or against given ideas , values , and practices , depends to a considerable degree on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy , initiative , and UNK STOP
START most UNK have some ideological diffusion at various UNK stages , as they experience a UNK of ideas and values STOP
START the diffusion is most UNK and most likely to become fixed , however , in those who have had no or very minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have been directed into UNK expression and so served as sources of developing UNK STOP
START a UNK ideological diffusion -- i.e, inability to identify independently with given ideas and value systems -- is reflected in many ways STOP
START for example , it is UNK by the UNK ( or adult ) whose beliefs and actions represent primarily his UNK and reaction against the ideas and behavior patterns of others , rather than his inner conviction and choice STOP
START it is UNK by the individual UNK UNK , whose ideas and behavior patterns are so dependent and UNK that they always UNK with those of the individual or group present and most important at the moment STOP
START in another sense , it is represented in the UNK of the `` true UNK '' who seek to UNK the validity of all other beliefs and ideas in order to UNK confidence in theirs STOP
START the case UNK provide some interesting illustrations of ideological diffusion , UNK in the unwed mother's inability to identify independently a given value system or behavior pattern , , and her subsequent UNK to assume any individual responsibility for her sexual behavior STOP
START for example , the unwed mothers expressed their UNK with males who did not indicate more UNK `` what it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly '' STOP
START they were UNK by the physical and emotional UNK of UNK sexual UNK STOP
START they condemned the movie UNK writers for UNK that sex was UNK and UNK STOP
START they UNK parents for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong ; ; STOP
START and they UNK parents who `` never UNK and were too UNK '' or who `` never explained how easy it was to get UNK '' STOP
START in the adult world , there are a number of rather general and UNK sources of ideological diffusion that further UNK the UNK search for meaning during this particular identity crisis STOP
START for example , some contemporary writing tends to UNK the `` good UNK '' and the `` bad UNK '' , to UNK the weak people as heroes and weakness as a virtue , and to explain ( or even justify ) UNK behavior by UNK it to UNK psychological , UNK , and social experiences STOP
START in the final accounting , these would have UNK the bill for both sides STOP
START an estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive STOP
START yet the huge amount of money UNK by the selden litigation , which many regarded as UNK , indirectly contributed to UNK changes in legal procedure STOP
START the UNK and other circumstances of the selden case made it a UNK example of the gross UNK of patent UNK actions STOP
START the suit , as we have seen , came before the courts when patent UNK , UNK , and UNK were making UNK demands for UNK in the american patent system STOP
START chief among the defects they UNK out were the complicated and UNK procedures in UNK STOP
START in a long and angry UNK to his opinion , judge UNK had UNK the weight of judicial UNK to such criticism STOP
START `` it is a duty '' , said UNK , `` not to let pass this opportunity of UNK against the methods of taking and printing testimony in UNK , current in this circuit ( and probably others ) , UNK if not justified by the rules of the supreme court , especially to be found in patent causes , and UNK UNK in this litigation STOP
START as long as the bar UNK to UNK evidence by written UNK , rather than UNK UNK before an UNK judicial officer , i fear that the UNK rules will remain UNK , and expensive UNK remain the best known characteristic of UNK '' STOP
START UNK that `` UNK sometimes begin with the UNK of UNK examples '' , UNK UNK the many UNK encouraged by existing procedures STOP
START he cited the UNK dimensions of the selden case record ; ; STOP
START the UNK of testimony and exhibits ; ; STOP
START the numerous UNK over minor matters ; ; STOP
START the `` UNK stated at UNK length '' ; ; STOP
START and the frequent and UNK verbal UNK , `` UNK for and UNK , from the UNK UNK to the lie direct '' STOP
START the fundamental difficulty of which the selden case was `` a striking ( though not singular ) example '' , concluded UNK , `` will remain as long as testimony is taken without any UNK judicial officer present , and responsible for the maintenance of discipline , and the reception or UNK of testimony '' STOP
START not least among the members of the patent bar who UNK this powerful UNK were those who had UNK in the selden suit STOP
START william UNK asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under rules of evidence , the testimony would have been completed in UNK days instead of five years STOP
START UNK joined lawyers in the UNK for reform , inevitably UNK upon the selden litigation as a `` UNK example '' STOP
START its UNK UNK were UNK to those of the british courts of UNK UNK UNK by dickens in UNK house STOP
START parker , who agreed with much of this criticism , did not UNK his UNK with UNK defects STOP
START but he felt that the selden case was being UNK UNK STOP
START in a detailed letter published in the scientific american in 1912 , he remarked that `` loose statements '' about the case showed UNK understanding of the facts STOP
START the suit , although commonly designated as a single action , actually UNK five cases STOP
START parker insisted that the size of the record would have been UNK reduced but for an UNK UNK of testimony STOP
START in a private communication written in UNK , parker had been more to the point STOP
START noting the UNK of UNK and members of the patent bar , he admitted that some of the UNK `` were fairly well founded '' , but he added that under existing rules the courts could not UNK testimony in a group of suits involving separate UNK of the same patent STOP
START the vast industrial interests caught up in the selden suit , as well as the complex character of the UNK art , encouraged both sides to UNK `` every possible chance '' for or against the patent , said parker STOP
START `` this very seldom happens in this class or in other cases , and of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the record beyond what UNK would occur '' STOP
START parker listed the UNK he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony STOP
START the most important of these found him in agreement with UNK UNK for reform STOP
START parker called for UNK of the UNK or UNK right of taking UNK before officers of the court who had no authority to limit testimony STOP
START the taking of UNK , he suggested , should be placed under a special court UNK UNK to UNK UNK and relevant answers and to UNK UNK testimony STOP
START `` i am satisfied that in the selden case had this power existed and this course ( been ) UNK , it would have UNK the UNK of some of the experts nearly UNK and of some of the other UNK thereto more than that '' STOP
START in the end UNK UNK protest , which parker called the `` now somewhat famous note on this ' selden ' case '' , did not go UNK STOP
START in 1912 the united states supreme court adopted a new set of rules of UNK which became effective on february 1 , UNK STOP
START the revised procedure was UNK as a UNK reform STOP
START under the new rules , testimony is taken UNK in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary character STOP
START other UNK methods are designed to prevent UNK , limit UNK , and reduce the expense of UNK suits STOP
START one of the UNK observed that if the selden case had been tried under this UNK procedure , the testimony which filled more than a score of volumes , `` at a minimum cost of UNK a page for publication alone , could have been contained in one volume '' STOP

START one manufacturer who held an UNK basic patent said : `` i would readily put over UNK into the manufacture of the device , but it is so easy to make that we would enter immediately into a prolonged UNK of patent litigation which would eat up all our profits '' STOP
START the prevailing view in the industry was UNK up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a senate committee : `` the UNK UNK and UNK expensive conditions , including UNK surrounding legal UNK , particularly in patent litigation , are items of industrial burden which must be written large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste '' STOP

START from the palazzo UNK you continue another block along the via UNK di UNK and UNK de UNK to the UNK palazzo UNK , begun in UNK and considered by many to be the UNK palace of all STOP
START UNK was the most distinguished of several noted UNK who helped design it STOP
START today it is occupied by the french embassy STOP
START its lovely UNK ceiling UNK , as well as the huge UNK room with a UNK high and UNK UNK wooden ceiling , can be seen UNK ( UNK to UNK UNK ) STOP
START ask to see the modern UNK of paris and rome designed by UNK STOP
START directly in front of the palace along the via UNK you will come to the UNK di UNK , the famous site of UNK during the UNK days of renaissance rome STOP
START today , by contrast it is a UNK and colorful fruit , UNK , and UNK market STOP
START continue on the via UNK to the UNK UNK UNK , then turn right for a couple of hundred yards to the church of UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP
START as you approach the church on the via UNK you are passing within yards of the remains of the roman theatre of UNK , near which is believed to have been the place where UNK UNK was UNK STOP
START the dome of the church is , outside of UNK , one of the largest in rome STOP
START opera UNK will be interested to learn that this church was the scene for the first act of UNK STOP
START at this point you cross the wide UNK UNK UNK 2 , , walk along the UNK UNK UNK a couple of hundred yards , then turn left on the via UNK UNK to enter the UNK piazza UNK , one of the truly UNK UNK in rome STOP
START your first impression of this UNK square with its three UNK UNK , its two churches that almost face each other , and its UNK buildings , is a sense of UNK UNK -- particularly welcome after UNK around the narrow and dark streets that you have followed since starting this walk STOP
START the site of the UNK piazza is UNK ancient UNK , which was probably used for horse and UNK races STOP
START for centuries it was the location of historic UNK and UNK sports events STOP
START from the UNK to the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in the summer , and the UNK would then ride around the UNK square in their UNK STOP
START UNK UNK `` fountain of the rivers '' , in the center of the piazza , is built around a roman UNK from the UNK of UNK which rests on UNK and UNK , with four huge figures , one at each corner , UNK four great rivers from different UNK -- the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , and the UNK STOP
START the eyes of the figure of the UNK are covered , perhaps either to UNK the mystery of her source or to UNK from her sight the UNK UNK of the church of UNK UNK in UNK , the work of UNK UNK , UNK STOP
START in the piazza UNK there are many delightful UNK where you can sit , have a drink or lunch , and watch the UNK in the square STOP
START the scene before you is indeed UNK and often appears in movies about rome STOP
START perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch STOP
START take the via di UNK in UNK , next to the church and opposite the center of the square , then turn right after about two hundred yards to reach the beautiful church of santa UNK UNK pace STOP
START inside you will find the lovely UNK painted by UNK and a chapel designed by UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK are among UNK UNK most beautiful UNK STOP
START now return to the piazza UNK and leave it on the opposite side by the UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START in a moment cross the UNK UNK UNK STOP
START in front of you is the palazzo UNK , once UNK to the UNK and now the italian senate STOP
START walk by the side of the palazzo and after two blocks along the via UNK you will come to the piazza UNK UNK STOP
START you are now facing the UNK , the largest and UNK building still standing from the days of ancient rome STOP
START this circular UNK , constructed by UNK in UNK , was UNK in its present shape by the emperor UNK STOP
START it was dedicated as a church in the seventh century STOP
START as you UNK in the piazza by the UNK UNK brought from the temple of UNK , you will UNK the UNK impressive UNK columns STOP
START the UNK interior , still in its original form , is truly UNK and an UNK UNK STOP
START its UNK forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from the floor to the ceiling STOP
START the only means of interior light is the UNK UNK in the UNK dome STOP
START standing before the UNK of UNK , the great genius of the renaissance , when UNK of UNK are UNK this great roman temple , you are once again reminded of the varied UNK so characteristic of rome STOP
START as you leave the UNK , take the narrow street to the right , the via UNK UNK , a block to UNK UNK , one of the most UNK UNK churches in the city STOP
START ( along the way there , about one hundred yards on your right , you pass a simple restaurant , la UNK , where you can have the best UNK in rome STOP
START ) the curve of UNK UNK houses in front of the church seems like a stage set STOP
START this is one of the most UNK little squares in this part of rome STOP
START one block along the via de UNK ( in front of the church ) will bring you to the stock exchange in the old temple of UNK STOP
START a few yards farther , on the via UNK UNK , is the piazza UNK STOP
START the great column from which the square takes its name was erected by the emperor UNK UNK STOP
START you are now at the UNK , though narrow , one of UNK UNK streets STOP
START horse races took place here in the middle ages STOP
START if you have taken this UNK in the morning , and you have the time and UNK , walk to the right along the UNK UNK for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings -- mainly of the UNK and UNK centuries -- in the palazzo UNK ( open sunday , UNK , and UNK , UNK to UNK ) STOP
START here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where the family still lives STOP
START otherwise , cross over the UNK and walk a block or so to the left STOP
START you will come to UNK , a delightful , though UNK expensive restaurant , which is particularly noted for its exceptional selection of ice UNK and UNK STOP
START either here , or in one of the UNK UNK nearby , is just the place to end this first walk through the heart of rome STOP
START to the spanish steps STOP
START the second walk through the heart of rome should be taken after lunch , so that you will reach the UNK hill when the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best STOP
START rare , indeed , is the UNK citizen , from the most UNK church member to the most UNK UNK , who does not have a long UNK to tell of police UNK , injustice , or UNK STOP
START i myself have UNK and UNK it more than once STOP
START the UNK and UNK also have a story STOP
START and so do the UNK STOP
START ( and this is not , perhaps , the place to discuss UNK very complex attitude toward black UNK , nor the reasons , according to UNK , that they are nearly all downtown STOP
START ) STOP
START it is hard , on the other hand , to UNK the UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK innocent , for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves STOP
START he , too , believes in good UNK and is UNK and UNK when they are not taken for the UNK STOP
START he has never , himself , done anything for which to be UNK -- which of us has ? ? STOP
START -- and yet he is facing , daily and UNK , people who would UNK see him dead , and he knows it STOP
START there is no way for him not to know it : there are few things under heaven more UNK than the UNK , UNK UNK and UNK of a people STOP
START he moves through UNK , therefore , like an UNK soldier in a UNK hostile country ; ; STOP
START which is precisely what , and where , he is , and is the reason he UNK in UNK and UNK STOP
START and he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company : the people who are watching him know why , too STOP
START any street meeting , sacred or secular , which he and his colleagues UNK cover has as its explicit or UNK burden the UNK and injustice of the white domination STOP
START and these days , of course , in terms increasingly vivid and UNK , it speaks of the end of that domination STOP
START the white UNK standing on a UNK street corner finds himself at the very center of the revolution now occurring in the world STOP
START he is not prepared for it -- naturally , nobody is -- and , what is possibly much more to the point , he is exposed , as few white people are , to the UNK of the black people around him STOP
START even if he is UNK with the UNK mustard grain of imagination , something must UNK in STOP
START he cannot avoid UNK that some of the children , in spite of their color , UNK him of children he has known and loved , perhaps even of his own children STOP
START he knows that he certainly does not want his children living this way STOP
START he can UNK from his UNK in only one direction : into a UNK which very shortly becomes second nature STOP
START he becomes more UNK , the population becomes more hostile , the situation grows more UNK , and the police force is increased STOP
START one day , to UNK UNK , someone drops a match in the powder UNK and everything UNK up STOP
START before the dust has settled or the blood UNK , UNK , speeches , and UNK UNK are UNK in the land , demanding to know what happened STOP
START what happened is that negroes want to be treated like men STOP
START negroes want to be treated like men : a perfectly UNK statement , containing only seven words STOP
START people who have UNK UNK , UNK , shakespeare , UNK , UNK , and the bible find this statement utterly UNK STOP
START the idea seems to UNK profound , barely conscious assumptions STOP
START a kind of UNK UNK their features , as though they found themselves UNK on the edge of a UNK place STOP
START i once tried to describe to a very well-known american intellectual the conditions among negroes in the south STOP
START my UNK disturbed him and made him UNK ; ; STOP
START and he asked me in perfect innocence , `` why don't all the negroes in the south move north '' ? ? STOP
START i tried to explain what has happened , UNK , whenever a significant body of negroes move north STOP
START they do not escape UNK UNK : they merely encounter another , UNK variety STOP
START they do not move to chicago , they move to the south side ; ; STOP
START they do not move to new york , they move to UNK STOP
START the pressure within the UNK causes the UNK walls to UNK , and this expansion is always violent STOP
START white people hold the line as long as they can , and in as many ways as they can , from verbal UNK to physical violence STOP
START but inevitably the UNK which has divided the UNK from the rest of the world falls into the hands of the UNK STOP
START the white people fall back UNK before the black UNK ; ; STOP
START the UNK make a UNK profit by raising the rent , UNK up the rooms , and all but UNK with the UNK ; ; STOP
START and what has once been a neighborhood turns into a `` UNK '' STOP
START this is precisely what happened when the puerto UNK arrived in their thousands -- and the UNK thus caused is , as i write , being fought out all up and down those streets STOP
START UNK UNK in an extremely dangerous luxury STOP
START they seem to feel that because they fought on the right side during the civil war , and won , they have UNK the right merely to UNK what is going on in the south , without taking any responsibility for it ; ; STOP
START and that they can ignore what is happening in northern cities because what is happening in little rock or UNK is worse STOP
START well , in the first place , it is not possible for anyone who has not UNK both to know which is `` worse '' STOP
START i know negroes who prefer the south and white southerners , because `` at least there , you UNK got to play any UNK games '' ! ! STOP
START the UNK games referred to have driven more than one negro into the UNK UNK , the UNK , or the river STOP
START i know another negro , a man very dear to me , who says , with conviction and with truth , `` the spirit of the south is the spirit of america '' STOP
START he was born in the north and did his military training in the south STOP
START he did not , as far as i can UNK , find the south `` worse '' ; ; STOP
START he found it , if anything , all too familiar STOP
START in the second place , though , even if UNK is worse , no doubt UNK , south africa , UNK it by several miles , and UNK was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history of the world STOP
START the world has never lacked for UNK examples ; ; STOP
START but i do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification for our own UNK STOP
START this UNK justification UNK the heart of all human feeling STOP
START the UNK our hearts become , the greater will be our UNK STOP
START UNK , the south is not merely an UNK backward region , but a part of this country , and what happens there concerns every one of us STOP
START as far as the color problem is concerned , there is but one great difference between the southern white and the UNK : the UNK UNK , historically and in his own UNK , a kind of UNK in which he loved black people and they loved him STOP
START historically , the UNK UNK laid across this UNK is the civil war STOP
START personally , it is the UNK sexual coming of age , when , without any warning , UNK UNK are set up between himself and his past STOP
START everything , thereafter , is permitted him except the love he UNK and has never UNK to need STOP
START the resulting , UNK UNK affects every southern mind and is the basis of the southern UNK STOP
START none of this is true for the UNK STOP
START negroes represent nothing to him personally , except , perhaps , the UNK of UNK STOP
START he never sees negroes STOP
START southerners see them all the time STOP
START UNK never think about them whereas southerners are never really thinking of anything else STOP
START negroes are , therefore , ignored in the north and are under UNK in the south , and suffer UNK in both places STOP
START neither the UNK nor the UNK is able to look on the negro simply as a man STOP
START it seems to be indispensable to the national UNK that the negro be considered either as a kind of UNK ( in which case we are told how many negroes , comparatively , bought UNK last year and how few , comparatively , were UNK ) , or as a victim ( in which case we are promised that he will never vote in our UNK or go to school with our UNK ) STOP
START they are two sides of the same UNK and the south will not change -- cannot change -- until the north changes STOP
START the country will not change until it UNK itself and UNK what it really means by freedom STOP
START in the UNK , UNK keep being born , UNK is increased by UNK , pride , and UNK , and the world UNK around us STOP
START it is a terrible , an UNK , law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without UNK one's own : in the face of one's victim , one sees UNK STOP
START walk through the streets of UNK and see what we , this nation , have become STOP
START 4 STOP
START east river , downtown : UNK to a letter from UNK STOP
START the fact that american negroes UNK in the UNK UNK UNK was UNK the assembly UNK and UNK most white americans STOP
START UNK speech , and the spectacular UNK in the UNK , were both UNK off by the death , in UNK , the day before , of UNK UNK STOP
START UNK stated , in the course of his address , that the united states was `` against '' UNK STOP
START god knows what the african nations , who hold 25 per cent of the voting stock in the UNK thinking -- they may , for example , have been thinking of the UNK when the vote on UNK freedom was before the assembly -- but i think i have a fairly accurate notion of what the negroes in the UNK were thinking STOP
START i had intended to be there myself STOP
START it was my first reaction upon hearing of UNK death STOP
START i was curious about the impact of this political UNK on negroes in UNK , for UNK had -- has -- captured the popular imagination there STOP
START i was curious to know if UNK death , which is surely among the most UNK of recent events , would UNK from `` our '' side anything more than the usual , UNK UNK STOP
START and i was curious about the african reaction STOP
START however , the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the UNK STOP
START had i been there , i , too , in the eyes of most americans , would have been merely a UNK in the hands of the communists STOP
START the climate and the events of the last decade , and the steady pressure of the `` cold '' war , have given americans yet another means of UNK UNK , and so it has been decided that the UNK were `` communist '' inspired STOP
START nor was it long , naturally , before prominent negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the UNK do not represent the real feeling of the negro community STOP
START according , then , to what i take to be the prevailing view , these UNK were merely a UNK of UNK , UNK UNK STOP
START i find this view amazing STOP
START it is a view which even a minimal effort at observation would immediately UNK STOP
START one has only , for example , to walk through UNK and ask UNK two questions STOP
START the first question is : would i like to live here ? ? STOP
START and the second question is : why don't those who now live here move out ? ? STOP
START the answer to both questions is immediately obvious STOP
START unless one takes UNK in the theory -- however UNK -- that negroes are , somehow , different from white people , i do not see how one can escape the conclusion that the UNK status in this country is not only a UNK injustice but a grave national UNK STOP
START now , i do not doubt that , among the people at the UNK day , there were UNK and professional UNK acting out of the most UNK motives STOP
START wherever there is great social UNK , these people are , UNK or later , to be found STOP
START their presence is not as UNK as the UNK which UNK their opportunity STOP
START what i find UNK -- and really dangerous -- is the american assumption that the negro is so UNK with his lot here that only the UNK agents of a foreign power can UNK him to protest STOP
START it is a notion which contains a UNK UNK , UNK , as it does , that negroes can make no move unless they are UNK STOP
START color was delayed until UNK , the wide screen until the early UNK STOP
START movement itself was the chief and often the only UNK of the primitive movies of the UNK STOP
START each film consisted of fifty feet , which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen STOP
START as long as audiences came to see the movement , there seemed little reason to UNK further STOP
START UNK UNK took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the UNK UNK which can still be found in such urban areas as times square STOP
START brief UNK of actual events were shown : UNK , UNK , street scenes STOP
START the UNK and UNK enjoyed popularity : a train UNK straight at the audience , or a great wave UNK to break over the UNK STOP
START an early UNK production was the execution of mary , queen of UNK STOP
START the unfortunate queen mounted the UNK ; ; STOP
START the UNK UNK his UNK ; ; STOP
START the head dropped off ; ; STOP
START end of film STOP
START an early film by a UNK of the UNK of UNK park simply showed a long UNK performed by two UNK of the contemporary stage STOP
START in the field of entertainment there is no UNK to financial UNK so effective as audience UNK , and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began UNK away in large numbers from the UNK , UNK shows STOP
START in response , the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day STOP
START despite the UNK beauty and UNK of numerous UNK , art films , and UNK , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as UNK , the movies are at heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short story STOP
START moreover , the most UNK successful of the UNK films have invariably UNK the narrative form from the fiction feature STOP
START thus such great american UNK as the river and the UNK that broke the UNK were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated UNK STOP
START the discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men , a french UNK , UNK UNK , and an american employee of UNK , UNK UNK STOP
START of the two , porter is UNK the better known , for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first step toward UNK a language of film , toward making the motion picture the UNK , efficient time machine that it has remained since , even in the most UNK hands STOP
START narrative time and film time STOP
START UNK , however , out of his professional UNK as a UNK , discovered and made use of a number of UNK techniques that remain part of the UNK of film STOP
START one of these is the `` UNK '' , which makes possible a UNK smooth transition from scene to scene STOP
START as the first scene begins to UNK , the UNK scene begins to appear STOP
START for a moment or two , both scenes are present simultaneously , one growing UNK , one growing stronger STOP
START in a series of UNK tales and UNK , UNK demonstrated that the film is UNK equipped to tell a UNK story , with beginning , middle and end , UNK , UNK , UNK , and conclusions STOP
START immediately , the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own UNK connection with time STOP
START physically , a movie is possible because a series of images is UNK one at a time at such a speed that the eye `` UNK '' the one that has gone before even as it UNK the one now UNK STOP
START UNK the UNK changing images together , the eye itself UNK them with the illusion of movement STOP
START the `` UNK '' time of painting and UNK is highly subjective , varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions STOP
START so is the time of the novel STOP
START the drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time , but the time is fixed by the director and the players , the conductor and the UNK , subject , therefore , to much variation , as record UNK well know STOP
START the time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely STOP
START the film consists of a series of still , UNK UNK , or `` frames '' , UNK STOP
START each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually UNK on the screen , at the rate , for UNK movies , of 16 frames per second , and , for sound films , 24 frames per second STOP
START this is the rate of UNK ; ; STOP
START it is also the rate of UNK STOP
START time is built into the motion picture , which cannot exist without time STOP
START now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative , which is , at its UNK , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an end -- elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence STOP
START the `` moving '' picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is , to be sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference is really one of degree ; ; STOP
START the UNK element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still UNK STOP
START in narrative , time is essential , as it is in film STOP
START almost everything about the movies that is UNK of the movies UNK from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time STOP
START this discovery of UNK was UNK more important than his sometimes UNK , UNK UNK produced on film STOP
START it was porter , however , who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since UNK STOP
START the movie was the great train UNK and its effects on the young industry and art were all but UNK STOP
START overnight , for one thing , UNK film UNK the standard running time of movies by ten STOP
START the great train UNK is a UNK film STOP
START one UNK -- from eight to twelve minutes -- became the standard length from the year of UNK , UNK , until UNK UNK that limit forever with birth of a nation in UNK STOP
START the UNK itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies STOP
START the material of the porter film is simplicity itself ; ; STOP
START much of it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of it -- good UNK and bad UNK in the old west -- pretty well dominated television toward the end of the UNK STOP
START a band of UNK enters a railroad station , UNK and ties up the telegraph operator , holds up the train and UNK STOP
START a UNK is formed and UNK the UNK , who , having made their escape , are UNK it up with some wild , wild women in a UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK run from the UNK , take cover in a UNK UNK , and are shot dead by the UNK STOP
START as a UNK is UNK a UNK of one of the band taking aim and firing his UNK straight at the audience STOP
START all this is simple enough , but in telling the story porter did two important things that had not been done before STOP
START each scene is shot straight through , as had been the universal custom , from a camera fixed in a single position , but in the outdoor scenes , especially in the capture and destruction of the UNK , UNK camera position UNK , necessarily , with the camera position standard until then , which had been , roughly , that of a UNK in a center orchestra seat at a play STOP
START the plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen STOP
START if the change , at first sight , seems minor , we may recall that it took the italian UNK about two hundred years to make an UNK change , and the italian UNK , by universal consent , were the most brilliant group of UNK any art has seen STOP
START in that apparently simple shift porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as well as a mechanical recording device STOP
START he did more than that STOP
START he revealed the potential value of the `` cut '' as the basic technique in the art of the film STOP
START cutting , of course , takes place automatically in the creation of a film STOP
START the meaning of the word is quite physical , to begin with STOP
START the physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence , and the cut edge is joined physically , by UNK , to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence STOP
START if , as a home movie UNK , you shoot the inevitable UNK of your child taking its first steps , you have merely recorded an historical event STOP
START if , in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends , you UNK the sequence to UNK in a few frames of the child's UNK watching this event , you have begun to be an artist in film ; ; STOP
START you are UNK the basic technique of film ; ; STOP
START you are cutting STOP
START this is what porter did STOP
START as the UNK leave the UNK train , the film suddenly cuts back to the station , where the UNK little daughter UNK with her father's dinner UNK only to find him bound on the floor STOP
START she UNK around in UNK STOP
START the two events are taking place at the same time STOP
START time and space have both become UNK STOP
START we UNK from event to event -- including the formation of the UNK -- even though the events , in `` reality '' are taking place not in sequence but simultaneously , and not near each other but at a considerable distance STOP
START the `` UNK '' as a standard film device probably dates from the great train UNK , and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device STOP
START the UNK in itself is a narrative ; ; STOP
START it UNK both speed and UNK and it demands cutting -- both from UNK to UNK and from stage to stage of the journey of both STOP
START the simple , naked idea of one man UNK another is of its nature better UNK for the film than it is for any other form of fiction STOP
START the UNK films , the UNK and UNK films , and the UNK UNK films UNK in an UNK UNK are not only UNK to what critics may assume to be a UNK taste for violence ; ; STOP
START these films and these UNK are also seeking out -- UNK or by design -- the UNK UNK elements of narrative STOP
START the creator of the art of the film : UNK STOP
START there still remained the need for one great film artist to UNK the full potential of the new form and to make it an art STOP
START the man was UNK STOP
START when he came to the movies -- more or less by accident -- they were still UNK entertainment capable of UNK the UNK for an UNK few minutes STOP
START in about seven years UNK either UNK or first realized the possibilities of virtually every UNK at the disposal of the film UNK STOP
START before he was forty UNK had created the art of the film STOP
START not that there had not been attempts , mostly european , to do exactly that STOP
START but in general the european efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself STOP
START UNK UNK UNK of famous novels and famous plays were presented STOP
START great UNK and UNK -- the most notable being UNK UNK -- were hired to repeat their stage performances before the camera STOP
START in all of this extensive and expensive effort , the camera was UNK to the status of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the UNK or by the author STOP
START the UNK today , for all its high UNK and UNK sound , is precisely what the early art UNK in the movies wished to make of the camera STOP
START not surprisingly , this approach did not work STOP
START the effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques in the early years of the century and some interesting records of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names STOP
START but no art at all was born of the art effort in the early movies STOP
START in general , religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the UNK ; ; STOP
START congregational membership , however , is another thing STOP
START a congregation UNK only if it can UNK a UNK UNK membership ; ; STOP
START that is , when it can preserve economic integration STOP
START religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation , since the decision to join a UNK group requires some motive force , but faith is not a sufficient condition for UNK ; ; STOP
START the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition STOP
START the UNK of social UNK in inner city areas and the spread of inner city UNK account for the decline of central city churches STOP
START central cities reveal two UNK features for the major denominations : ( 1 ) central cities tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes ; ; STOP
START ( 2 ) central cities tend to be more UNK in social composition STOP
START the central city areas , in other words , exhibit the two characteristics which UNK the life principle of congregations of the major denominations : they have too few middle-class people ; ; STOP
START they UNK middle-class people with UNK UNK STOP
START central city areas have become UNK UNK UNK for the major denominations since the UNK of middle-class people from most central cities STOP
START with few exceptions , the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central city STOP
START the key to protestant development , therefore , is economic integration of the UNK of the congregation STOP
START members of higher and lower social status often UNK around this UNK , so that protestant figures on social class give the impression of spread over all social classes ; ; STOP
START but this is UNK , for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic UNK STOP
START the congregation UNK when it is no longer possible to UNK that core from the neighborhood ; ; STOP
START moreover , residential UNK is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have to UNK constantly in their core UNK in order to survive ; ; STOP
START they can lose UNK and UNK members from the church without UNK , but they need adequate UNK for the core UNK in order to preserve economic integration STOP
START the congregation is first and UNK an economic UNK group ; ; STOP
START it is UNK a UNK and UNK fellowship STOP
START if it were primarily a UNK fellowship , it would UNK UNK from all social and economic UNK , something which most congregations of the new protestantism ( with a few notable exceptions ) have not been able to do STOP
START they survive only when they can UNK social and economic UNK STOP
START the UNK of protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the `` UNK spirit '' of protestant religious life ; ; STOP
START in fact , a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the `` UNK '' roman catholic UNK STOP
START we have seen that the UNK spirit is confined to economic UNK ; ; STOP
START consequently , the UNK to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in protestant congregations ; ; STOP
START actually , there is little evidence of such personal community in protestant congregations , as we shall see in another connection STOP
START the UNK of protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must UNK , therefore , to the principle of economic integration STOP
START this fact is evident in the UNK of new members STOP
START mission as UNK STOP
START the rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary UNK of the major denominations STOP
START there is much talk in theological circles about the `` church as mission '' and the `` UNK mission '' ; ; STOP
START UNK have been UNK the fact that the church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the UNK of the world STOP
START a crucial question , therefore , is what UNK and mission actually mean in metropolitan protestantism STOP
START if economic integration really shapes congregational life , then UNK should be a process of extending economic integration STOP
START the task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of UNK individuals and families of similar social and economic position to UNK the nuclear core of the congregation STOP
START ( UNK means to choose by joint action in order to fill a UNK ; ; STOP
START it can also mean the UNK of centers of power from an environment in order to UNK an organization STOP
START ) in a mobile society , congregational health depends on a constant process of UNK ; ; STOP
START this UNK , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will UNK the congregation ; ; STOP
START therefore , the UNK or missionary UNK of the congregation will be UNK rather than proclamation -- like elements will have to be UNK STOP
START UNK and congregational UNK have not been carefully studied in the churches ; ; STOP
START one study in UNK , however , has illuminated the situation STOP
START in a sample of new members of UNK churches , almost 60 per cent were UNK by initial `` contacts with friendly members '' STOP
START if we add to these contacts with friendly members the `` contacts with an organization of the church '' ( UNK per cent of the cases ) , then a substantial two UNK of all UNK is through friendly contact STOP
START on the surface , this seems a sound approach to christian mission : members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care for new people ; ; STOP
START the new people respond in kind by UNK the church STOP
START missionary UNK by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods ; ; STOP
START the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position ; ; STOP
START association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of UNK relations STOP
START this means that the UNK of the congregation are extended into the community , UNK up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation ; ; STOP
START the mission of the church is actually a process of UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START the lay ministry is a means to UNK UNK people who will UNK the social class UNK of the congregation STOP
START churches can be UNK through this process of UNK so long as the UNK of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration ; ; STOP
START once the pool of UNK UNK , the congregation is helpless -- friendly contacts no longer keep it going STOP
START the UNK of mission to UNK is further indicated by the UNK of educational activities , worship , preaching , and UNK in reaching new members STOP
START the proclamation of the churches is almost UNK confined to UNK contacts by the clergy ( UNK per cent of new members ) and friendly contacts by members ( over two UNK if UNK activities are included ) STOP
START UNK UNK for UNK per cent of the initial contacts with new members STOP
START in general , friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a UNK will account for a major share of UNK by the churches , making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through UNK is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church ; ; STOP
START economic integration and UNK are the two methods by which protestants associate with and UNK from the neighborhood STOP
START the inner life of congregations will UNK so long as UNK people of similar social and economic level can UNK together ; ; STOP
START the outer life of congregations -- the UNK of the environment to their survival -- will be UNK so long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership STOP
START economic integration UNK when the social and economic UNK in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation STOP
START in a rapidly changing society congregations will run into difficulties repeatedly , since such UNK UNK of economic integration are hard to UNK in the UNK for more than a single generation STOP
START the fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more UNK in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance STOP
START the expense of this type of organization in religious life , when one UNK the number of city churches which UNK beyond UNK before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions about the principle of protestant survival in a mobile society ; ; STOP
START UNK , the UNK of economic integration in congregations UNK the nature of the protestant development STOP
START it was observed in the UNK chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends -- expanding UNK on an UNK basis and growing UNK in local UNK UNK STOP
START these trends seem to be working at UNK in the UNK STOP
START residential associations struggle to UNK themselves against UNK STOP
START the UNK of UNK UNK and UNK of residential communities have UNK ; ; STOP
START the UNK between central city and UNK , negro and white , blue UNK and white UNK can be viewed as UNK of this deeper UNK of trends in the UNK STOP
START it now becomes evident that the UNK church is UNK involved with the economy of middle-class culture , for it serves to UNK the social class identity of middle-class residential UNK STOP
START the UNK pace of metropolitan changes has UNK the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations STOP
START this conformity represents a desperate attempt to UNK a UNK UNK environment STOP
START more than creatures of metropolitan forces , the churches have taken the lead in UNK the UNK of metropolitan life , UNK and UNK the UNK of peoples , giving form to the struggle for social UNK in a world of UNK peoples STOP
START since american life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life , the UNK forces of residential and religious UNK have fought a desperate , UNK action against the expanding UNK of the UNK STOP
START consumer communities have suffered at the hands of the productive interests STOP
START negroes , puerto UNK , and rural UNK are slowly making their way into the cities STOP
START soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs , and the churches will experience the same decay and UNK cycle which has characterized their history for a century STOP
START the identification of the basic unit of religious organization -- the UNK or congregation -- with a residential area is UNK in a modern UNK , for it simply means the UNK of an iron trap on the UNK of the christian fellowship and the UNK of mission to UNK STOP
START mission to the UNK UNK survival of the congregation in the residential community , because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan UNK with residential UNK STOP
START this interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various UNK for the churches STOP
START it could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is UNK to become an expression of the UNK for stable identity among the middle classes STOP
START it could be argued that only such neighborhoods can UNK religious activity , since worship UNK some local UNK STOP
START whatever UNK one makes , the striking fact about congregational and UNK life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people STOP
START attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the UNK churches ; ; STOP
START this style is UNK an expression of the UNK style of the middle classes STOP
START the UNK of this style are UNK and emphasis on achievements in UNK UNK STOP
START these values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman , UNK the methods of child UNK , determining the pattern of community participation , setting the style for the UNK treatment of middle-class UNK , and UNK the congregational life of the major denominations STOP
START `` fellowship by UNK '' and `` mission by friendly contact '' form the iron UNK of UNK religion STOP
START its UNK are another matter , for they reveal the kinds of interests UNK by the congregation STOP
START what goes on in the UNK will occupy our attention under the UNK of the organization church STOP
START an understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to UNK the forces which have UNK the iron UNK of conformity which UNK the churches in their suburban UNK STOP
START the UNK question still remains as to why the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their UNK and UNK should fill the same need STOP
START with capital largely UNK , there seemed to them no other course to pursue STOP
START the directors sold directly to UNK , who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company STOP
START these UNK UNK where they wished and generally dealt with the indians through UNK , who might be UNK , UNK , or even soldiers STOP
START the UNK also had to pay a tax of UNK on the goods they UNK , and all UNK were to be taken to company stores and UNK to france in company ships STOP
START the company disposed of the UNK , but with what profit , the records do not show STOP
START in UNK with its UNK policy , the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal indians STOP
START the UNK use of presents had been effective in expanding the indian trade of new france and louisiana in the previous century , and the change in UNK aroused UNK in the minds of the red men STOP
START traders from the english UNK were far more generous , and indian loyalty turned to them STOP
START UNK from UNK and UNK passed UNK , and the UNK policy of the company probably let loose indian UNK that brought UNK to the company STOP
START in UNK the king sent three UNK to louisiana with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect the colony STOP
START they ordered the raising of troops and obtained UNK UNK with which to build UNK STOP
START they adopted a program by which louisiana was divided into five districts STOP
START in each of these there was to be a strong military post , and a trading depot to supply the smaller trading houses STOP
START for UNK louisiana , mobile was the principal post , and it was to furnish supplies for trade to the north and east , in the region threatened by british traders STOP
START mobile was to be the UNK of a chain of posts extending UNK to the sources of the tennessee river STOP
START fort UNK , on the alabama river , had been erected in UNK for trade with the UNK and UNK , but money was available for only one other new post , near the present UNK , tennessee , and this was soon abandoned STOP
START west of the mobile district was the lower mississippi district , of which new orleans was headquarters STOP
START dependent upon it were posts on the lower mississippi and the region UNK to the UNK of new UNK STOP
START on the middle mississippi a principal post was to be located near the mouth of the arkansas STOP
START it was hoped that to this post would flow a large quantity of UNK from the west , UNK down the arkansas river STOP
START on the ohio or UNK was to be built another post `` at the UNK of two great rivers '' STOP
START other posts would be established up the ohio and UNK to protect communication with canada STOP
START on the upper mississippi the illinois post was to be established near UNK , and dependent posts were to be built on the missouri , `` where there are mines in UNK '' STOP
START each of the five principal posts was to have a director , responsible to a UNK at new orleans STOP
START an elaborate system of accounting and reports was worked out , and the trade was to be managed in the most scientific way STOP
START UNK were to be under the supervision of the directors STOP
START UNK must be UNK to the UNK , and must serve until the term provided in the UNK was ended STOP
START the UNK were to be encouraged to trade and were to UNK of their UNK to the UNK STOP
START only two principal UNK were actually established -- one at mobile , the other at new orleans STOP
START new orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the mississippi , and west of that river , and on the ohio and UNK STOP
START mobile was also supplied by new orleans with goods for the mobile district STOP
START the power that UNK exercised during his first administration cannot be determined STOP
START regulations for the indian trade were made by the UNK UNK de la UNK , and UNK apparently did not have control of that body STOP
START the UNK even treated the serious matter of british UNK as its business and , on its own authority , sent to UNK UNK UNK `` suitable for the UNK trade '' STOP
START it decided , also , that the purely secular efforts of UNK were UNK , and sent UNK to win the UNK from the UNK UNK STOP
START during the first administration of UNK , the UNK trade of the mobile district was a UNK source of revenue STOP
START the UNK brought in UNK UNK to UNK UNK , and the UNK and UNK brought the total up to UNK UNK STOP
START these UNK were the raw material for the manufacture of UNK , and were the only articles which the UNK of this district had to exchange for european goods STOP
START during his first administration , UNK succeeded in keeping carolina traders out of the alabama country and the UNK country STOP
START the director of the post at mobile kept an adequate amount of french goods , of a kind to which they were UNK , to supply the indian needs STOP
START the alabama and UNK rivers furnished a highway by which goods could be moved quickly and UNK STOP
START de la UNK , commander of the alabama post , had the friendship of the UNK , and was able to make them look upon the british as poor UNK STOP
START UNK UNK , the most prominent UNK in the district , was UNK and UNK , but his methods often aroused the UNK of the french UNK STOP

START in UNK some UNK UNK the french traders among them , and did not make peace for four years STOP
START UNK traders , however , continued to come to them from mobile , and to obtain a considerable number of UNK for the french markets STOP
START british traders from south carolina UNK the indians against the french , and there developed french and british UNK in the UNK STOP
START the UNK finally were the occasion for the most UNK wars during the french control of louisiana STOP
START to hold them was an essential part of french policy , for they controlled the upper UNK of the UNK from the north to mobile STOP
START they threatened constantly to give the british a hold on this region , from UNK they could move easily down the rivers to the french UNK near the UNK STOP
START UNK realized that if the french were to hold the UNK UNK against the UNK of british goods , french traders must be able to offer a supply as UNK as the UNK and at reasonable prices STOP
START his UNK brought some results STOP
START the company of the UNK promised to send over a supply of indian trading goods , and to price them more UNK in terms of UNK STOP
START but it coupled with this a requirement that indians must bring their UNK to mobile and thus save all costs of transportation into and out of the indian country STOP
START the UNK of UNK upon giving liberal prices to the indians , in order to drive back the carolina traders , was probably a factor that led to his recall in UNK STOP
START for two years his friend and UNK , UNK , remained as acting governor and could do little to stem the anglican advance STOP
START although he UNK a few friendly indians to UNK the UNK , and even kill some of them , the carolina advance continued STOP
START the company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from carolina , and when UNK came over as governor in UNK , he was given special instructions regarding the trade of the mobile district STOP
START but the company of the UNK , holding to its program of economy , made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive prices STOP
START to the directors the problem appeared a matter of UNK or UNK STOP
START UNK attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to UNK among the indians STOP
START these agents were to UNK the difference between english and french goods , and the prices charged the indians STOP
START they were to UNK the UNK UNK , and , wherever possible , to UNK the UNK to UNK the traders from carolina STOP
START they were to promise fine presents to the UNK red men , as well as an UNK supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering STOP
START UNK UNK gained some successes STOP
START the UNK divided into two UNK ; ; STOP
START one was british and the other , french STOP
START so hostile did these UNK become that , among the UNK , civil war broke out STOP
START UNK efforts , however , were on the whole UNK in winning back the UNK of the mobile district , and he decided to send troops into the troubled country STOP
START he asked the government for two hundred soldiers , who were to be specifically assigned to UNK english traders and UNK indians STOP
START in spite of the company's restrictions , he planned to build new posts in the territory STOP
START he asked also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the UNK UNK STOP
START no help came from the crown , and UNK , in UNK , gave a UNK of the indian trade in the district to UNK STOP
START UNK went UNK to work , and gave credit to many UNK STOP
START but they brought back few UNK to pay their UNK , and soon french trade in the region was at an end STOP
START UNK finally , in one last bid in UNK , cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent above the cost in france STOP
START the indians were not impressed and held to the carolina traders , who UNK over the country , almost to the mississippi STOP

START the king accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the company at UNK UNK STOP
START UNK , the commerce of louisiana was free to all UNK STOP

START the difficulties of trade had UNK many UNK , and numbers of them had gone to live with the UNK and rear UNK families STOP

START if this trade should be resumed , the UNK who had come to be farmers or UNK , and soldiers UNK from the army , must be UNK to the severe life of UNK de UNK STOP
START this was a slow and difficult course , and french trade suffered from the many UNK of the new group of traders STOP
START these men were without capital or experience STOP
START UNK and UNK , the UNK , wished either to UNK the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individuals who would UNK their UNK with UNK STOP
START UNK , who returned to UNK UNK in UNK , UNK that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of UNK a trade in which they could see no hope of profits STOP
START he reported , too , that among the UNK there were none of UNK and ability sufficient to justify UNK them with the UNK goods STOP
START he did find some to trust , however , and he employed the UNK soldiers to trade STOP
START with no company to UNK , he kept close control over all the traders STOP
START in order to compete with english traders , UNK UNK changed the price schedule STOP
START the king should expect no profit , and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in france , which would cover the expense of transportation and handling , was all he charged the traders STOP
START they would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a UNK in paris or UNK UNK at the UNK expense STOP

START the next day i visited international christian college which has developed since the war under the leadership of people who were UNK and who know japan well STOP
START they are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching and learning STOP
START the UNK has open UNK even in the UNK UNK UNK STOP
START spiritual life is UNK , but students do not need to be christian STOP
START they have an UNK record of being able to place in employment UNK of their graduates STOP
START in the afternoon miss UNK and her mother invited me to go with them and young UNK to see the famous spring UNK of the UNK dancers STOP
START UNK is one of the japanese women one UNK about -- beautiful , UNK UNK , an UNK manager of her big household -- ( four boys and four girls ) , and yet looking like a UNK , gentle japanese woman STOP
START she was a real experience ! ! STOP
START the UNK were as beautiful as anything i have ever seen -- they UNK the new york UNK for UNK and precision as well as imagination STOP
START because UNK was leaving the next day , i spent the evening with him at asia center STOP
START the following morning UNK called for me , and we went to visit schools -- UNK , UNK , UNK school , and high school -- UNK school STOP
START there is much more freedom in the schools here than i expected -- some think too much STOP
START there is a great deal of thought being given to the question of moral education in the schools STOP
START with the loss of the emperor UNK in japan , the people are left in confusion with no god or moral UNK that have strength STOP
START the older parents continued to teach their children traditional principles , but the younger people , who have lost all faith and convictions , are now parents STOP
START there seems to be no purpose in life that is sure -- no certain UNK principles to give stability STOP
START as a result , money is spent quickly and freely , with no thought of its value STOP
START UNK is everywhere , especially among students STOP
START parents UNK their children STOP
START the government has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to UNK some moral education for the schools -- but the teachers often have no firm conviction and are confused STOP
START i was told that it is quite likely that japanese soldiers would not fight again -- for why should they ? ? STOP
START it will be painful , but interesting , to see what kind of a god these people will create or what strong convictions they will develop STOP
START in the evening the former UNK state science teachers met for dinner at the new UNK restaurant where i had my first raw fish and found it good STOP
START they suggested several new foods , and usually i found them good , except the UNK , which i think i could learn to like STOP
START six of the science teachers were present , and we had great fun STOP
START UNK STOP
START after a day at UNK , UNK put me on the train for UNK STOP
START my instructions were that UNK would meet me at the hotel , but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm welcome STOP
START my hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by UNK and the japan travel bureau and were more UNK than i would have chosen , but it was fun for once to be UNK -- i did explain to the students , however , that this was not my usual style , for their UNK are very small , and it seemed out of place for me to be UNK so well STOP
START they understood and UNK me a bit about it STOP
START i think i would have been much UNK in japan if i had not seen UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START UNK is the ancient capital of japan and still its cultural center STOP
START it , along with UNK , was UNK by the war -- and is now a beautiful example of the UNK of UNK japan STOP
START here i was accompanied by UNK ( UNK mother ) , her son , UNK ( a prospective student with whom i have been corresponding for more than a year ) , and UNK , one of the science teachers STOP
START i arrived at UNK UNK by UNK UNK had finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned STOP
START we walked miles and saw various UNK and gardens STOP
START we visited the UNK home -- where for the first time i saw the famous tea UNK STOP
START at UNK UNK went to the UNK spring UNK at the place where these beautiful UNK UNK STOP
START they were even better than those of UNK -- more spectacular and more imaginative STOP
START after a UNK of UNK ( rice with UNK -- UNK which is raised in an UNK pond at the foot of UNK ) , i returned to my beautiful room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day STOP
START we started at 9 UNK visit the UNK university where UNK is attending STOP
START i was UNK at the very poor hospital facilities accompanying the medical school STOP
START they UNK for the condition , including dirt and UNK , and i was a little at a loss to know what to say STOP
START there seemed to be no UNK ? ? STOP
START i don't have the answer yet STOP
START we had tea at UNK home where i learned that he , too , comes from a very UNK family STOP
START his UNK is a UNK priest ; ; STOP
START and he , being the UNK , was supposed to be a priest , but he chose to do UNK , and one of his brothers is to become the priest STOP
START this is a significant fact in japan , for only a few years ago he would have had no choice STOP
START in his big home live four families and thirty people , so it needs to be big STOP
START also , there are UNK here some UNK historical UNK from 400 to UNK years old -- paintings , UNK , UNK , etc STOP
START he had displayed more of them than usual so that i could enjoy them STOP
START about 100 of the most important items he had already given to the museum STOP
START the house itself is 400 years old with all the UNK of older , UNK times STOP
START UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START UNK went with me on the train to UNK STOP
START we passed his house and school on the way STOP
START in UNK i stayed at the hotel where the prince and UNK had stayed on their UNK STOP
START a new red UNK had been laid for their coming , but i walked on it , too STOP
START here UNK met us after a UNK train trip from the town where he UNK STOP
START even though we had walked miles in UNK that day , we started out again to see UNK at night STOP
START in the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles to UNK to put me on the train for UNK STOP
START again the plan was for me to go alone , but they wouldn't let me STOP
START at UNK , UNK had to leave us to get the train to his home , but UNK and i had an hour and a half before train time to see UNK at night STOP
START it is the second largest city in japan , with about four million people STOP
START one spot in UNK i shall always remember -- the bridge where we stood to watch the UNK of the elaborate UNK signs in the still waters of the river STOP
START in the UNK of a great busy city , people take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light STOP
START my train arrived in UNK at the UNK hour of UNK UNK STOP
START i had planned to go to the hotel by UNK and sleep a little , after which UNK would arrive and pilot me around STOP
START but there he was at the train with an UNK state UNK in his hand STOP
START i know now why the students insisted that i go to UNK even when i told them i didn't want to STOP
START they knew that i was still UNK over the tragic event , and they felt that if i could see the recovery and the spirit of the people , who hold no UNK , but who also UNK UNK harbor , i would be UNK and would understand better a new japan STOP
START there were no words to say this but there was no need STOP
START the teachers of UNK school gave me a small gift to UNK me for coming STOP
START UNK is a better city than it was before -- in the minds of the people i met was a strong determination for peace and understanding STOP
START i was UNK for their insight into my need for this experience STOP
START a better world may yet come out of UNK STOP
START UNK STOP
START on arriving in UNK later we were met by UNK who took us immediately to her university , the japanese women's university STOP
START this day was `` open house for parents '' day , and the girls were busy preparing exhibits and UNK tea tables STOP
START everything was in an exciting UNK -- full of anticipation and fun STOP
START it was UNK to see the effect of an UNK teacher on japanese students in a class in home planning STOP
START our UNK is one of the very few UNK in japan who is trying to plan homes around family functions and women's needs STOP
START i am told the time will soon come when women will find it necessary to do most of their own work , and even now it is important to have UNK for the use of servants STOP
START many of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in american homes , but an interesting UNK of cultures finds us using japanese UNK in our own western UNK at the same time that the japanese are UNK western utility patterns STOP
START at this women's university we find a monument to a UNK family who believed that japanese women also should be educated STOP
START even today there are some UNK about the value of education for japanese women , but this university continues to grow and to send its students out into the community STOP
START active UNK have built a fine building on the campus where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they can have their social UNK and professional meetings STOP
START as far as i am concerned there is continuous UNK up of evidence that the creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found by educated women UNK to break traditions STOP
START UNK is also teaching in a UNK school for japanese UNK in UNK STOP
START here the women learn to keep house as UNK ; ; STOP
START they become skilled in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests STOP
START they learn how to take care of children and sick members of the family STOP
START they have model UNK , a sick room with a model patient in bed , and a UNK with a UNK UNK STOP
START although the training is only for one month , it is intensive and thorough STOP
START graduates of this UNK school are much in demand and can always find work immediately STOP
START occasionally they return for additional training STOP
START UNK home economics training comes into play as she designs UNK along modern functional lines for the storage of cleaning materials STOP
START UNK also uses the training she got in an american home where she learned to UNK furniture , clean corners , and work effectively in keeping a UNK house STOP
START her education in the united states , not just in a classroom , but also in an american house with an american UNK , stands her in good UNK STOP
START university of UNK STOP
START after a fine UNK in the UNK , the kitchen of which UNK had planned , UNK and i left to meet representatives of the UNK for a visit to the university of UNK STOP
START here again it was vacation time and there were many things i could not see , but i was able to visit with a professor who is famous in japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant STOP
START the achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch UNK not only by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following UNK between attorney general UNK and the heads of certain national chain stores should , of course , be UNK STOP
START but for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of a UNK throughout the nation would require the UNK of facts contrary to those assumed in the UNK case STOP
START the UNK in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing a connection between general company practice and local practice in the south , and by establishing such direct connection between the practice and the economic UNK of stores located in new york and general company policy STOP
START then the UNK would not be secondary , but a primary one STOP
START it would be directed against the actual location of the UNK policy which , for UNK sake and for the sake of justice , must be removed , and , UNK from this , to the economic injury of the people directly and UNK a part of this policy STOP
START perhaps this would be sufficient to justify an economic UNK of an entire national chain in order , by threatening potential injury to its entire economy , to effect an UNK of the policy of its local stores in the matter of UNK STOP
START such a general UNK might still be a UNK or UNK instrument , and therefore of UNK justification STOP
START action located where the evil is concentrated will prove most decisive and is most clearly legitimate STOP
START moreover , UNK alone would indicate that , unless the local customs are already ready to fall when pushed , the results of direct economic action everywhere upon national chain stores will likely be simply to give UNK advantage to local and state stores which UNK to these customs , leading to greater UNK and local autonomy within the company , or even ( as the final UNK of an UNK application of economic pressure to correct injustice ) to its going out of business in certain sections of the country ( as , for that matter , the UNK , who once had many meetings in the UNK war south , largely went out of business in that part of the country over the slavery issue , never to UNK a large number of southern UNK ) STOP
START in any case , anyone who UNK to make significant distinction between primary and secondary applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified that use of economic UNK as a means which broke out a few years ago or was UNK organized by white UNK UNK in the entire state of mississippi against every local UNK dealer in that state , in protest against a UNK program over a national tv network on which was presented a drama showing , it seemed , a `` high yellow UNK '' UNK with a white man STOP
START it is true , of course , that the end or objective of this action was different STOP
START but since this is a world in which people UNK about ends and goals and concerning justice and injustice , and since , in a situation where direct action and economic pressure are called for , the justice of the matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not effectively present , there has to be a morality of means applied in every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures or other forms of force STOP
START the need that we not give UNK approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed against the actual UNK of injustice is clear also in light of the fact that white UNK UNK seem resolved to maintain UNK mainly by the use of these same means and not UNK by physical violence STOP
START an unlimited use of economic pressures for UNK opposite causes could UNK the UNK of any fellow humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously UNK means STOP
START the end or aim of the action , of course , is also important , especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community customs but of the use of deadly economic power to UNK a person from UNK forward to claim his legal rights , e.g, against negroes who register to vote in UNK county , tennessee , at the present moment STOP
START here the UNK is in steps to give economic UNK to those being UNK , and to legal UNK STOP
START this , however , is sufficient to show that more or less UNK resistance and economic conflict ( if both sides are strong enough ) can be war of all against all no less than if other means are used STOP
START it is also sufficient to show the christian and any other UNK of justice that he needs to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his conduct is just , i.e, that , if economic pressure has to be UNK to , this be applied directly against those persons directly in the way of some UNK change in business or UNK practices , while , if injury fall upon others , it fall upon them indirectly and UNK ( however inevitably ) and not by UNK UNK and direct action against them STOP
START it is clear that UNK resistance is a mode of action in need of justification and UNK in christian morality , like any other form of resistance STOP
START the language used itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle for victory ( perhaps to be chosen above all others ) STOP
START one of the UNK leaders has said : `` nobody from the top of heaven to the bottom of hell can stop the march to freedom STOP
START everybody in the world today might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom is going to march over them '' STOP
START the present writer certainly UNK with that statement , and would also affirm this -- in the order of justice STOP
START however , it is also a christian insight to know that unless UNK UNK justice it is not likely to be freedom that UNK forward STOP
START and when UNK UNK man's struggle for justice and freedom it does not simply UNK this with a UNK good will STOP
START it also UNK UNK conduct in the way explained above , and this means far more than in the choice of UNK means STOP
START UNK has written that `` UNK and good will of the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the UNK of physical UNK , to cause the UNK to lose his moral balance STOP
START he suddenly and UNK UNK the moral support which the usual violent resistance of most UNK would UNK him '' ; ; STOP
START and again , that `` the object of UNK resistance is partly UNK to this object of war -- namely , to UNK the UNK , to break his will , to destroy his confidence , enthusiasm , and hope STOP
START in another respect it is UNK , for UNK resistance UNK the UNK only to UNK in him a new UNK that is UNK because it is based on UNK values '' STOP
START a trial of strength , however , is made quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone UNK in UNK resistance will be convinced that his action is based on UNK values than those of his UNK ; ; STOP
START and in warfare with any means , men commonly UNK over the justice of the cause STOP
START this makes necessary a morality of means , and principles governing the conduct of resistance whenever this is thought to be justified STOP
START the question , then , is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even UNK means of UNK is to be found in the fact that such conduct UNK and UNK the UNK while UNK and UNK him STOP
START here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some causes as more important than their lives ; ; STOP
START and to them it will seem UNK that it is proposed to defeat such causes UNK STOP
START a technique by which it is proposed to enter with UNK into the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem the more unlimited UNK STOP
START among christian groups , the UNK have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that the nature of divine UNK raises UNK the question of the christian use of all forms of pressure STOP
START since the will and word of god are for them concentrated in UNK love , it seems clear to them that UNK resistance is quite another thing STOP
START `` the primary objective of UNK '' , writes the outstanding UNK UNK , `` is not peace , or UNK to the divine will , but rather certain desired social changes , for personal , or class , or national advantage '' STOP
START without UNK with every phrase in this statement , we must certainly assert the great difference between christian love and any form of resistance , and then go on beyond the UNK position and affirm that christian UNK must first justify and then determine the moral principles UNK resistance STOP
START these principles we have now set forth STOP
START economy in the use of power needs not only to be asserted , but clearly specified ; ; STOP
START and when this is done it will be found that the principles governing christian resistance cut across the distinction between violent and UNK means , and apply to both alike , UNK either on occasion and always UNK either action STOP
START economy in the use of power means more than UNK a barely UNK pressure upon an UNK and upon the injustice opposed STOP
START that would amount to UNK the means and UNK them wholly in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals STOP
START there must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use of means of resistance , violent or UNK STOP
START the justification in christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also UNK down its UNK -- in the distinction between the persons against whom pressure is primarily directed , those upon whom it may be permitted also to fall , and those who may never be directly UNK for the sake even of achieving some great good STOP
START in these terms , the `` economic UNK '' of the negroes of UNK , tennessee , from trading in the center city , for example , was clearly justified , since these distinctions do not require that only people UNK guilty be UNK out STOP
START we may now take up for consideration a hard case which seems to require either no action UNK economic pressure or else action that would seem to UNK the principles set forth above STOP
START there may be instances in which , if economic pressure is to be undertaken at all , this would have to be applied without discrimination against a whole people STOP
START an excellent article was published recently in the journal of the church peace union by a south african UNK on the UNK economic conditions of the UNK in south africa , UNK to UNK slavery , and the economic UNK of both the government and the people of the united states in these conditions STOP
START `` UNK of american dollars , not only from capital UNK but also from the UNK of UNK '' , this author states , `` are being poured into south africa to support a system dedicated to the UNK , the UNK , and the almost UNK UNK of 12 million people the color of whose UNK happens not to be white '' STOP
START both the conditions and the UNK are UNK in considerable detail STOP
START this leads to the conclusion that `` the fact is UNK that america does have a say in whether or not UNK shall continue '' STOP
START our leadership in a wide economic UNK of south africa would be not only in UNK , it seems , with the moral conscience of america , not to be denied because we also as a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our own country , but also in UNK with our law , UNK title 19 , section UNK , which UNK the UNK of goods made by forced or UNK labor STOP
START not only should this provision be enforced but other economic and political actions might be taken which , this author believes , `` must surely be supported by every american who values the freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated by the lines in his account books that he can UNK and UNK contribute to the UNK of another nation '' STOP
START northern liberals are the chief UNK of civil rights and of integration STOP
START they have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare state STOP
START and both in their objectives of UNK and of social progress they have had ranged against them the southerners who are called UNK STOP
START the name presumably UNK from the french royal house which never learned and never UNK ; ; STOP
START since UNK UNK , though of UNK origin , is at least as much UNK by liberals in the north as by UNK in the south STOP
START the nature of the opposition between liberals and UNK is too little understood in the north STOP
START the race problem has tended to UNK other , less emotional , issues which may UNK be even more UNK STOP
START it is these other differences between north and south -- other , that is , than those which concern discrimination or social welfare -- which i chiefly discuss UNK STOP
START i write about northern liberals from considerable personal experience STOP
START a UNK married to a new UNK , i have lived for many years in a connecticut UNK town with a high percentage of artists , writers , UNK men , and business UNK of UNK UNK STOP
START most of them are democrats and nearly all consider themselves , and are viewed as , liberals STOP
START this is UNK to an UNK conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism , because it is clear that these democrats who are UNK are at opposite UNK from the liberal jefferson , who held that the best government was the least government STOP
START yet UNK my liberal friends continue to view jefferson as one of their UNK UNK STOP
START when i question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy , i find that they fall into two categories : the simpler ones who have simply accepted the UNK of their faith without analysis ; ; STOP
START and the UNK , UNK ones who UNK UNK that these things don't count any more in the world of UNK STOP
START i am naive , they say , to make use of such words STOP
START i take this to mean that the UNK -- and therefore necessarily UNK ? ? STOP
START -- liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local UNK as well as democratic processes may have to yield before it STOP
START this seems like an attitude UNK a sort of UNK UNK which , under a president of the same UNK , would try to UNK an UNK congress or supreme court STOP
START as for UNK rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as UNK of a minor and UNK nature which exist now only as UNK STOP
START the american liberal may , in the world of UNK , have a strong case ; ; STOP
START but he presents it publicly so UNK in UNK that it is not an honest one STOP
START why , in the first place , call himself a liberal if he is against UNK and UNK an UNK central government with UNK controls over everybody ? ? STOP
START if he UNK little importance to personal liberty , why not make this known to the world ? ? STOP
START and if he is so UNK of the rights of states , why not UNK a different sort of constitution that he could more UNK support ? ? STOP
START i am concerned here , however , with the northern UNK attitude toward the south STOP
START it appears to be one of intense UNK , which he makes little effort to UNK even in the presence of southern friends STOP
START his assumption seems to be that any such friends , being UNK UNK , must be more liberal than most southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his views STOP
START UNK editor , thomas UNK , in his book , the UNK culture , wrote : `` most of what was different about it ( the deep south ) i found myself UNK to STOP
START '' this , for the liberals i know , would be an UNK STOP
START theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the UNK UNK that was directed against UNK STOP
START i do not think that my experience would be typical for southerners living in the north STOP
START in business circles , usually conservative , this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found STOP
START but in our case -- and neither my wife nor i have extreme views on integration , nor are we given to emotional UNK -- the situation has UNK one or two UNK UNK and come close to UNK several more STOP
START in fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south , because it is not easy for the most objective UNK to sit UNK by when his host is telling a UNK of people that the only way to deal with southerners who UNK integration is to send in troops and shoot the UNK down STOP
START accounts have been published of northern liberals in the south up against UNK UNK , especially in UNK universities where pressure may be strong to UNK the majority view STOP
START but these accounts do not show that UNK have been subjected to UNK or UNK by UNK displayed in social UNK STOP
START from my UNK experience and other sources , this seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles STOP
START the strong feeling is certainly there ; ; STOP
START but there is a UNK of liberalism among college graduates throughout the south , especially among those who studied in the north STOP
START and social relations arising out of business ties UNK UNK , if not sympathy , toward UNK and visiting UNK STOP
START also , among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the UNK southern attitude on most social problems STOP
START there are of course many UNK ; ; STOP
START but for this discussion the most important division is between those who have been UNK and those who UNK STOP
START my definition of this much UNK UNK is that a UNK UNK is one who is UNK that the north won the war STOP
START nobody knows how many southerners there are in this category STOP
START i suspect that there are far more UNK ones than the north likes to believe STOP
START i never heard of a UNK being taken on the question STOP
START no doubt such a thing would be considered UNK STOP
START prior to 1954 i imagine that a majority of southerners would have voted against the UNK STOP
START since the supreme UNK decision of that year this is more doubtful ; ; STOP
START and if a UNK had been taken immediately following the UNK of troops to little rock i believe the majority would have been for the old south STOP
START belief in the traditional way of life UNK much more in the older states than in the new ones STOP
START probably a larger percentage of UNK and south UNK remain UNK than elsewhere , with georgia , north carolina , and alabama following along after them STOP
START old attitudes are held more UNK in the UNK than the UNK ; ; STOP
START so that a line running down the length of the south UNK the upper limits of UNK would roughly divide the old south from the new , but with , of course , important minority UNK STOP
START the UNK areas of states like virginia and south carolina developed the UNK culture to its UNK UNK , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater STOP
START also , we should not even UNK discount the fact that a region such as the UNK UNK UNK on UNK had closer ties with england and the west UNK than with the north even after independence STOP
START the social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area STOP
START in certain respects defeat increased the persistent UNK of the old south STOP
START poor where they had once been rich , UNK where they had been UNK , having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation , the UNK who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country STOP
START and no doubt many people in states like the UNK and georgia , which were among the most tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , UNK UNK the UNK against the crown STOP
START among UNK the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining UNK than other factors STOP
START all southerners agree that slavery had to go ; ; STOP
START but many historians maintain that except for northern UNK it would have ended in states like virginia years before it did STOP
START southern UNK has been over the method of its ending , the UNK , and UNK ; ; STOP
START their fears now are of UNK and negro political control in many counties STOP
START but apart from racial problems , the old UNK south -- to use the moderate words UNK by UNK UNK -- finds itself UNK to most of what is different about the civilization of the north STOP
START and this , in effect , means most of modern america STOP
START it is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise STOP
START and UNK , i feel , many UNK UNK themselves about the south STOP
START for one thing , this is not a subject often discussed or analyzed STOP
START there seems to be almost a UNK of silence UNK it STOP
START i suppose the reason is a kind of UNK thinking : don't talk about the final stages of UNK and they will take care of themselves STOP
START or else the north really believes that all southerners except a few UNK old characters have come around to UNK the errors of their past , and are now at heart UNK of the american dream , like everybody else STOP
START if the circumstances are faced UNK it is not reasonable to expect this to be true STOP
START the situation of the south since UNK has been unique in the western world STOP
START regardless of rights and UNK , a population and an area appropriate to a UNK 1 great power have been , following UNK , ruled against their will by a neighboring people , and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls they UNK STOP
START and the great majority of these people are of anglo-saxon or UNK UNK STOP
START this is the only case in modern history of a people of UNK origin UNK without continued struggle to what they view as foreign domination STOP
START the fact is due mainly to international wars , both hot and cold STOP
START in every war of the united states since the civil war the south was more UNK than the rest of the country STOP
START so instead of being tests of the UNK loyalty , the spanish war , the two world wars , and the UNK war all served to overcome old UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START and there is no section of the nation more UNK than the south in the cold war against communism STOP
START had the situation been UNK , had , for instance , england been the enemy in UNK because of issues of concern chiefly to new england , there is little doubt that large numbers of southerners would have UNK put on their old confederate UNK to fight as allies of britain STOP
START it is extraordinary that a people as proud and UNK as southerners should have been as UNK as they have STOP
START the north should UNK its stars that such has been the case ; ; STOP
START but at the same time it should not draw false UNK UNK STOP
START the two main charges UNK against the UNK by liberals is that they are UNK and social UNK STOP
START there is much truth in both these charges , and not many UNK deny them STOP
START whatever their UNK , they are not UNK STOP
START most of them UNK believe that the anglo-saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure STOP
START many UNK believe this , too , but few of them will say so publicly STOP
START the UNK economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of northern UNK STOP
START but those among the UNK who remain UNK go much further than this STOP
START they believe that if the south had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern america STOP
START as it is , they consider that the north is now UNK the fruits of excess UNK , that in spite of its high standard of living the `` american way '' has been proved UNK to the english and UNK ways , although they UNK of the UNK features of the latter STOP
START the UNK UNK to northern civilization includes such charges as poor UNK , UNK UNK , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like UNK and the use of UNK STOP
START their own easier , UNK UNK is especially dear to southerners ; ; STOP
START and i have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up north because they so much prefer the UNK habits of their home town STOP
START in the past , the duties of the state , as sir henry UNK noted long ago , were only two in number : internal order and external security STOP
START by prevailing over other UNK for the UNK of men , the UNK maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial UNK STOP
START outside those limits it asserted , as against other states , a position of sovereign UNK , and , as against the `` UNK '' peoples of the UNK world , a position of UNK STOP
START it became the UNK `` subject '' of `` international law '' ( a term which , it is pertinent to remember , was UNK by UNK ) , a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what western nations could do in the world UNK STOP
START ( that UNK of law was a reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries STOP
START speaking generally , it UNK -- and still tends to further -- the interests of the western powers STOP
START the enormous changes in world politics have , however , thrown it into confusion , so much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in need of UNK and UNK in light of the social conditions of the present era STOP
START ) STOP
START beyond the two basic tasks mentioned above , no attention was paid by UNK or UNK to an idea of state responsibility , either UNK or UNK STOP
START this was particularly true in the world UNK , which was an UNK UNK characterized by UNK and UNK competition for colonial UNK STOP
START that any sort of duty was UNK by his nation to other nations would have UNK a nineteenth-century UNK STOP
START his duty was to his sovereign and to his nation , and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial UNK was not to be UNK STOP
START thus , to UNK but one example , the UNK UNK of the nineteenth century , whether with the british navy ruling the UNK or with the city of london ruling world finance , was strictly national in UNK , however much other nations ( e.g, the united states ) may have UNK UNK STOP
START at the same time , all suggestions that some sort of UNK responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial state was strongly UNK STOP
START social UNK was able to UNK off the UNK socialist movement until well into the present century STOP
START however , in recent decades , for what UNK are multiple reasons , an UNK but UNK readily UNK shift has occurred in both UNK of national activity STOP
START a concept of responsibility is in process of UNK and establishment STOP
START already firmly UNK UNK , it is a growing factor in external matters STOP
START a little more than twenty years ago the american people turned an important corner STOP
START in what has UNK been called a `` constitutional revolution '' , the basic nature of government was transformed from one essentially negative in nature ( the `` UNK state '' ) to one with UNK duties to perform STOP
START the `` positive state '' came into existence STOP
START for lawyers , UNK perhaps their UNK UNK , there has been a special UNK since then in the role played by the supreme court in that transformation -- the manner in which its decisions altered in `` the switch in time that saved nine '' , president UNK UNK but in effect UNK `` UNK plan '' , the UNK of judicial approval that was finally placed upon social legislation STOP
START of greater importance , however , is the content of those programs , which have had and are having enormous consequences for the american people STOP
START labor relations have been transformed , income security has become a UNK feature of political UNK , and all the many UNK of the american version of the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom STOP
START a national UNK of near UNK exists that these governmental efforts are desirable as well as necessary STOP
START UNK in the republican party victory in 1952 , the positive state is now evidenced by political campaigns being UNK not on whether but on how much social legislation there should be STOP
START the general acceptance of the idea of governmental ( i.e, UNK ) responsibility for the economic UNK of the american people is surely one of the two most significant UNK in american constitutional history STOP
START the other , of course , was the civil war , the conflict which a century ago UNK national unity over UNK STOP
START a third , one of at least equal and perhaps even greater importance , is now being UNK : american UNK and involvement in world affairs STOP
START internal national responsibility , now a UNK , need not be UNK STOP
START nevertheless , it may be helpful to UNK one example -- that of employment -- for , as will be shown below , it cuts across both UNK of the new concept STOP
START thirty years ago , while the nation was UNK in economic depression , the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow `` natural forces '' to operate and cure the distress STOP
START that UNK principle of the UNK administration fell to the UNK guns of the new deal ; ; STOP
START less than a score of years later congress enacted the employment act of 1946 , by which the national government assumed the responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment STOP
START UNK the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through planning -- the economic side of the constitutional revolution STOP
START in 1961 the first important legislative victory of the kennedy administration came when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress won out over a `` UNK '' proposal -- provision was made for payment for UNK relief by UNK UNK rather than by a UNK only on those states UNK with manpower surplus STOP
START the american people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between UNK and 1961 STOP
START internal national responsibility is a UNK response to the impact of the industrial revolution STOP
START reduced to its UNK terms , it is an assumption of a collective duty to UNK for the inability of individuals to cope with the UNK of the era STOP
START national responsibility for individual welfare is a concept not limited to the united states or even to the western nations STOP
START a measure of its widespread acceptance may be derived from a statement of the international congress of UNK in 1959 STOP
START meeting in new UNK under the UNK of the international commission of UNK , a body of lawyers from the free world , the congress UNK and expanded the traditional rule of law to include UNK governmental duties STOP
START it is UNK that the majority of the UNK to the congress were from the less developed , former colonial nations STOP
START the rule of law , historically a principle according everyone his `` day in court '' before an UNK UNK , was UNK UNK by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare STOP
START UNK that the rule of law is `` a dynamic concept which should be employed not only to UNK the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society '' , the congress asserted that it also included the responsibility `` to establish social , economic , educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized '' STOP
START the idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the UNK world STOP
START for better or for worse , we all now live in welfare states , the UNK principle of which is collective responsibility for individual UNK STOP
START whether a concept UNK to the principle of internal responsibility UNK in a nation's external relations is less obvious and more difficult to establish STOP
START the hypothesis UNK here is that it does , and that evidence is UNK UNK that proposition STOP
START the content is not the same , however : rather than individual security , it is the security and continuing existence of an `` ideological group '' -- those in the `` free world '' -- that is basic STOP
START external national responsibility involves a UNK requirement that the leaders of the western nations so guide their decisions as to further the UNK of other friendly nations STOP
START if internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of UNK , then external responsibility implies UNK to principles of ideological UNK STOP
START reference to two other concepts -- nationalism and sovereignty -- may help to reveal the contours of the new principle STOP
START in its UNK the UNK had to struggle to assert itself -- UNK , against UNK groups , and UNK , against the power and influence of such other UNK for loyalty as the church STOP
START the UNK of the holy roman empire and the UNK of UNK led , not more than two centuries ago , to the UNK of nationalism STOP
START ( since the UNK of the UNK UNK roughly with the separate existence of the united states as an independent UNK , it is perhaps natural for americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest form of order , something permanent and UNK STOP
START ) the concept of nationalism is the political principle that UNK and UNK the territorial state as the characteristic type of UNK structure STOP
START but it is more than that STOP
START for it includes the emotional ties that UNK men to their UNK and the complex UNK that hold a large group of people together as a unit STOP
START today , as new nations rise from the former colonial UNK , nationalism is one of the UNK forces loose in the world STOP
START almost UNK in intensity , the principle has become UNK in application -- unfortunately at the very time that UNK UNK can UNK greatest UNK STOP
START historically , however , the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the western UNK group STOP
START by UNK UNK lesser groups the nation has , to some degree at least , UNK the capacity for individual liberty STOP
START within their UNK , moreover , technological and industrial growth has proceeded at an UNK pace , thus increasing the UNK from which material wants can be satisfied STOP
START while the pattern is UNK , some having gained more than others , nationalism has in fact served the western peoples well STOP
START ( whether historical nationalism helped the peoples of the remainder of the world , and whether today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally UNK aspects , are other questions STOP
START ) STOP
START it is one of the UNK UNK of history that the UNK and UNK of nationalism and the territorial state are rapidly UNK at precisely the time that the UNK UNK its highest number ( approximately 100 ) STOP
START but it is more than UNK : one of the main reasons why nationalism is no longer a UNK concept is because it has spread throughout the UNK STOP
START in other words , nationalism worked well enough when it had limited application , both as to UNK and as to population ; ; STOP
START it becomes a UNK UNK when adopted on a world-wide basis STOP
START UNK the political principle of nationalism is the legal principle of sovereignty STOP
START the former receives its UNK from the latter STOP
START operating side by side , together they helped shore up the UNK STOP
START while sovereignty has roots in UNK , in its present usage it is essentially modern STOP
START UNK UNK , writing in the UNK century , may have been the UNK UNK , but it was the UNK influential john UNK who set out the main lines of the concept as now understood STOP
START UNK nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty still UNK much of today's legal and political thinking STOP
START to him , law is the command of the sovereign ( the english UNK ) who UNK the power of the nation , while sovereignty is the power to make law -- i.e, to UNK over internal groups and to be free from the commands of other UNK in other nations STOP
START these fundamental ideas -- the UNK of sovereignty and its UNK ( UNK ) aspects -- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political power STOP
START the UNK , then , UNK the principle of nationalism and exercises sovereignty : supreme power over domestic affairs and independence from outside control STOP
START in fact , however , both principles have always been UNK and UNK defined STOP
START UNK UNK are always difficult to UNK down with precision STOP
START that is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies , in which `` popular '' sovereignty is said to exist , and in federal nations , in which the jobs of government are split STOP
START nevertheless , nationalism and sovereignty are UNK , in the accepted wisdom , to describe the modern world STOP
START is there a different reality behind the UNK ? ? STOP
START does the surface UNK a quite different picture ? ? STOP
START the short answer to those questions is `` yes '' STOP
START both concepts are UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START to some degree they are being UNK by a concept of national responsibility STOP
START as evidence to support that view , consider the following UNK instances STOP
START can UNK war be set off by accident ? ? STOP
START what steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of UNK that could UNK the destruction of UNK ? ? STOP
START are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster ? ? STOP
START is anything being done to increase our UNK of safety ? ? STOP
START will the danger increase or decrease ? ? STOP
START i have just asked these questions in the UNK , in the white house , in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that UNK for months UNK , with UNK rows of green UNK tubes which contain UNK missiles and which are UNK known as `` UNK forest '' STOP
START i asked the same questions inside the UNK rooms of an atlas missile base in UNK , where officers who wear UNK are UNK the `` UNK UNK '' that could start a war -- UNK or by design -- and in the command centers where other UNK men could give orders to push such UNK STOP
START to the men in the UNK UNK UNK , submarine UNK and the UNK , UNK rooms that would be the UNK of UNK UNK UNK wars , the questions seem UNK STOP
START there is UNK pressure , but its sources are immediate STOP
START `` readiness exercises '' are almost continuous STOP
START each could be the real thing STOP
START in the command centers there are special UNK ready to UNK off the minutes UNK since `` e hour '' STOP
START `` e '' stands for `` execution '' -- the moment a `` go order '' would UNK an american nuclear strike STOP
START there is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these UNK STOP
START they are UNK riding herd on control panels , switches , UNK colored lights on pale green or gray UNK that look like business machines STOP
START they know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details STOP
START UNK war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their UNK of UNK complex tasks STOP
START among the policy makers , UNK , UNK , psychologists and others charged with controlling the actions of the UNK UNK and their `` UNK '' , the answers to my questions varied partly according to a man's UNK for what the UNK in this field call `` UNK '' STOP
START as an air force UNK put it : `` you can't have dry runs on this one '' STOP
START the experts are thus forced to UNK UNK of events that have never occurred , probably never will -- but possibly might STOP
START only one rule UNK in my UNK with these men : the more highly placed they are -- that is , the more they know -- the more concerned they have become STOP
START already UNK war is a UNK guest at the discussions within the kennedy administration about the UNK of UNK and nearly all other questions of national security STOP
START only recently new `` holes '' were discovered in our safety measures , and a search is now on for more STOP
START work is under way to see whether new UNK devices should be installed on all nuclear weapons STOP
START meanwhile , the experts speak of wars UNK by `` false UNK '' , `` UNK '' , `` UNK behavior '' and other terms that will be discussed in this report STOP
START they UNK a secret world centered on `` go codes '' and `` gold UNK '' STOP
START their UNK were , almost invariably , accompanied by the same UNK -- arms and pointed UNK UNK toward each other in UNK UNK UNK STOP
START one arm represented our bombers and missiles , the other arm `` theirs '' STOP
START yet UNK in each movement was the death of millions , perhaps hundreds of millions , perhaps you and me -- and the experts STOP
START these men are not UNK STOP
START it is their job to think about the UNK STOP
START UNK they believe that the world would become a UNK place if more of us -- and more russians and communist chinese , too -- thought about UNK war STOP
START the first systematic thinking about this UNK box within UNK UNK was done four years ago by fred UNK , a UNK , UNK UNK UNK STOP
START he was , and is , with the UNK corporation , a UNK pool of UNK financed by the UNK force STOP
START his investigations made him the paul UNK of UNK war , and safety procedures were UNK increased STOP
START in recent weeks , as a result of a UNK defense policy UNK by the kennedy administration , basic united states strategy has been modified -- and large new sums UNK -- to meet the UNK danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible STOP
START the chain starts at UNK ( ballistic missile early warning system ) in UNK , UNK STOP
START its radar UNK would register soviet missiles shortly after they are launched against the united states STOP
START UNK intelligence is simultaneously UNK to UNK ( north american air defense command ) in UNK springs , UNK , for interpretation ; ; STOP
START to the UNK command and control post , UNK feet below the ground at UNK air force base , near UNK , UNK ; ; STOP
START to the joint war room of the joint UNK of staff in the UNK and to the president STOP
START UNK , UNK , several kinds of radio systems and , in some cases , television , UNK all vital points STOP
START UNK locations exist for all key command centers STOP
START for UNK UNK UNK has UNK command posts on UNK jet UNK STOP
START multiple UNK , UNK and frequencies make the chain as UNK as possible STOP
START the same principle of `` UNK '' applies to all communications on these special networks STOP
START and no messages can be UNK on these UNK until UNK and UNK UNK in advance , by special codes , that the messages actually come from their UNK sources STOP
START additional codes can be used to challenge and UNK the UNK STOP
START only the president is permitted to UNK the use of nuclear weapons STOP
START that's the law STOP
START but what if UNK UNK to break it ? ? STOP
START the president cannot personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear UNK STOP
START he makes the UNK decision STOP
START hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the UNK UNK and to push the UNK STOP
START what if one or more of them turn UNK or suddenly , UNK , decide to UNK the russians ? ? STOP
START what if the president himself , in the language of the military , `` goes UNK '' ? ? STOP
START or UNK decided to reverse national policy and hit the UNK without UNK ? ? STOP
START nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers STOP
START however , the system is designed , UNK and UNK , so that no one man could UNK a UNK war STOP
START even the president cannot pick up his telephone and give a `` go '' order STOP
START even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike -- the `` go code '' STOP
START in an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the `` UNK circuit '' STOP
START a system of `` gold '' -- actually yellow -- UNK UNK him with the offices and action stations of the secretary of defense , the joint UNK of staff , the UNK commander and other key men STOP
START all can be connected with the gold circuit from their homes STOP
START all could help the president make his decision STOP
START the talk would not be in code , but neither would it UNK STOP
START vital questions would be quickly answered according to a UNK UNK STOP
START officers who participate in the UNK practice UNK assured me that the UNK decision could be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes after the first UNK from aj STOP
START if communications work , his decision would be UNK known in all command posts that would UNK the actual go order STOP
START for these centers , too , are on the gold circuit STOP
START they include the UNK atlantic command at UNK , virginia , which is in contact with the UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START nato headquarters in europe ; ; STOP
START air force forward headquarters in europe and in the pacific , which control UNK UNK on ships and land bases ; ; STOP

START in a word , plenty STOP
START the key man almost certainly would be UNK UNK , UNK senior UNK STOP
START he or his UNK or one of their seven UNK , all full UNK , UNK the heart of the command post UNK hours a day STOP
START it is a quiet but impressive room -- UNK feet long , UNK feet wide , UNK feet high STOP
START movable panels of UNK maps and UNK are UNK with intelligence information STOP
START and bill UNK , UNK , a UNK son from UNK , ohio , is a quiet but impressive man STOP
START his eyes are steady UNK of the UNK brown STOP
START his movements and speech are precise , clear and quick STOP
START no question UNK him or causes him to UNK STOP
START UNK , who has had the chief UNK job for four years , calls the signals for a team operating three rows of UNK UNK UNK with lights , switches and UNK STOP
START at least a dozen men , some armed , are never far away from him STOP
START in front of him is a gold UNK STOP
START in UNK the UNK commander , UNK power , or his UNK and their staff would occupy a UNK that UNK across the length of the room above UNK and his staff STOP
START at general UNK seat in the UNK there is also a gold UNK STOP
START general power would participate in the decision making STOP
START UNK , below , would listen in and act STOP
START his UNK can give him UNK contact with more than UNK bases around the world and with every UNK aircraft STOP
START he need only pick up one of the two red telephone UNK at his extreme left , right next to the big red UNK marked alert STOP
START ( there are two UNK in case one should be dropped and UNK STOP
START ) STOP
START but UNK , too , does not know the go code STOP
START he must take it from `` the red box '' STOP
START in point of fact , this is a UNK box with a bright red door , about one and a half feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to UNK right STOP
START the box is UNK UNK so the door can never be opened without setting off a UNK UNK ( `` it's real UNK '' ) STOP
START now we must become vague , for we are approaching one of the nation's most UNK UNK STOP
START the codes in the red box -- there are several of them covering various UNK -- are contained in a sealed UNK `` unique device '' STOP
START they are supplied , a UNK at a time , by a secret source and are continually changed by UNK or his staff , at random intervals STOP
START but even the UNK of UNK box cannot start a war STOP
START they are mere UNK , just one portion of UNK messages STOP
START what these UNK are and how they UNK the go order may not be revealed STOP
START the pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by UNK staff STOP
START in addition to the UNK and UNK procedures which UNK and follow the sending of the go messages , again in special codes , each message also contains an `` internal UNK '' , another specific signal to UNK the UNK that he is getting the real thing STOP
START i asked UNK what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start UNK one STOP
START `` UNK wind up full of bullet holes '' , he said , and there was no question that he was talking about bullets fired by his UNK STOP
START now let us imagine a UNK of UNK , on alert near their `` positive control ( or UNK ) points '' , the spots on the map , many miles from soviet territory , beyond which they are UNK to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets STOP
START they , too , have UNK of the go code with them STOP
START as UNK put it , `` they have separate pieces of the pie , and we have the whole pie STOP
START once we send out the whole pie , they can put their pieces into it STOP
START unless we send out the whole pie , their pieces mean nothing '' STOP
START why does UNK UNK code always UNK with the UNK in possession of the UNK UNK ? ? STOP
START the answer is a UNK secret STOP
START at any rate , three men out of a UNK UNK crew are required to copy down UNK UNK message STOP
START each must match UNK `` pie '' with the UNK that he UNK with him STOP
START all three must compare notes and agree to `` go '' STOP
START after that , it requires several minutes of concentrated work , including six separate and UNK actions by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate stations in a UNK , each with another man beside him to help , for an armed UNK to be released STOP
START unless all UNK are properly operated -- and the UNK and UNK from the UNK removed first -- no damage can be done STOP
START suddenly , however , their UNK changed and the game ended STOP
START they went as rigid as black UNK six figures , UNK and tall and angular , went still STOP
START their heads were in the air UNK STOP
START they all UNK at the same UNK in the same direction STOP
START they saw it before i did , even with my UNK STOP
START it was nothing more than a tiny distant rain UNK , a UNK gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds to the earth STOP
START in the UNK degrees of horizon it UNK only a degree , no more STOP
START a white man would not have seen it STOP
START the UNK fastened upon it with a concentration beyond UNK STOP
START watching , they waited until the UNK UNK and began to move in a long UNK UNK across the dry burning land STOP
START at once the whole band set off at a UNK STOP
START they were UNK a rain cloud STOP
START they went after the UNK as UNK as a UNK pack after an abandoned cow STOP
START i followed them in the UNK and now they did not care STOP
START the games were over , this was life STOP
START occasionally , for no reason that i could see , they would suddenly UNK the angle of their trot STOP
START sometimes i UNK it was because the rain UNK had changed direction STOP
START sometimes it was to UNK a UNK STOP
START their UNK is impossible to UNK in words STOP
START it has nothing of the proud UNK of the trained UNK about it , it is not a UNK , it is not done with style or UNK STOP
START it is the UNK of the human who must run to live : arms UNK , legs barely UNK over the ground , head hung down and only occasionally UNK up to see the target , a loose motion that is just short of UNK and yet is UNK UNK STOP
START it is a barely controlled UNK of the ground STOP
START they ran for three hours STOP
START finally , UNK UNK and seeking low ground , they UNK the rain UNK STOP
START for ten minutes they ran beneath the UNK , raising their arms and , for the first time , UNK and UNK STOP
START then the wind died and the rain UNK held steady STOP
START they were studying the ground STOP
START suddenly one of them UNK , ran a few feet , bent forward and put his mouth to the ground STOP
START he had found a depression with rain water in it STOP
START he bent down , a black UNK figure , and put his mouth to the ground STOP
START with a UNK and generous gesture , the UNK stood up and UNK to the UNK of his fellows STOP
START the other UNK over and UNK at the tiny UNK STOP
START in an UNK he had UNK it dry STOP
START the UNK lives on the UNK land i have ever seen STOP
START which does not mean that it is UNK STOP
START part of it is , of course STOP
START there are thousands of square miles of salt UNK which are UNK STOP
START they are huge areas which have been swept by UNK for so many centuries that there is no soil left , but only deep UNK UNK fifty or UNK yards apart with UNK between them thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that moves is a UNK layer of sand STOP
START such UNK have an UNK UNK quality STOP
START but much of the land which the UNK UNK looks as if it should be UNK STOP
START it is UNK by the UNK and the UNK , has a peaceful quality , the hills roll UNK STOP
START the UNK of such a landscape has been UNK described by the UNK charles UNK STOP
START he tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single UNK , a UNK square owned by a sheep UNK STOP
START they went UNK with everything except knowledge of the `` UNK '' country STOP
START `` STOP
START the UNK looked like a beautiful open park with gentle UNK and soft gray UNK STOP
START nothing UNK or UNK rushed upon these men STOP
START only there happened -- nothing STOP

START no one came '' STOP
START the white men died STOP
START and UNK others like them have died STOP
START even today range UNK will come upon UNK bodies of men who attempted nothing more difficult than a UNK UNK and slowly lost direction , were UNK by the heat , driven UNK by the constant and UNK promise of the landscape , and who finally died STOP
START the UNK is not UNK ; ; STOP
START he knows that the land is hard and UNK STOP
START he knows that the economy of life in the `` UNK '' is UNK STOP
START there is no room for error or waste STOP
START any UNK that UNK or UNK the signals or UNK is done STOP
START i do not know if such a way of life can come to be a UNK challenge , but i suspect that it can STOP
START perhaps this is what gives the UNK his odd air of dignity STOP
START the family at the UNK STOP
START seeing an UNK today is a difficult thing STOP
START many of them have UNK into the cities and towns and UNK STOP
START others are confined to vast UNK , and not only does the UNK government UNK not wish them to be viewed as exhibits in a UNK , but on their UNK they are extremely UNK , UNK camps , coming together only for UNK at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch -- which is very low indeed STOP
START i persuaded an UNK friend who had lived `` UNK '' for years to take me to see some UNK living in the UNK STOP
START it was a difficult and ambiguous kind of UNK , even though the UNK was said to be expert in his knowledge of the UNK and their language STOP
START finally , however , the arrangements were made and we drove out into the UNK in a land UNK STOP
START we followed the UNK road for a few miles and then UNK off onto a smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth STOP
START the UNK went a mile down this road and then , when he reached a big red UNK , UNK off the road STOP
START at once he started to glance toward the instrument panel STOP
START it took me a moment to realize what was odd about that panel : there was a UNK compass UNK to it , which UNK gently back and forth as the land UNK UNK about STOP
START the UNK was UNK his way across the UNK STOP
START `` do you always UNK like this '' ? ? STOP
START i asked STOP
START `` UNK right '' , he said STOP
START `` once i get out on the flat i do STOP
START some UNK that know an area well can make their way by UNK , a tree here , a wash here , a UNK there STOP
START but if you don't know the place like the palm of your hand , UNK better use a compass and the UNK STOP
START two miles UNK , then five miles southwest that sort of thing STOP
START very simple '' STOP
START he was right STOP
START the landscape kept UNK itself STOP
START i would try to UNK UNK and saw in a UNK that it was UNK STOP
START finally we approached the UNK of the UNK STOP
START they were UNK beside a large UNK UNK : a man , his UNK , and two children STOP
START the sun was not yet high and all of them were in the small area of shade cast by the UNK STOP
START there was also a dog , a UNK dog STOP
START its UNK showed , it was a yellow UNK color , it suffered from a variety of UNK , hair had UNK off its body in UNK STOP
START it lay with its head on its UNK and only its eyes moving , watching us carefully STOP
START it struck me as a very bright and very UNK dog STOP
START no one UNK the dog STOP
START it was not a UNK STOP
START it was a worker STOP
START `` the UNK love shade '' , the UNK said STOP
START `` i suppose because it UNK them some loss of body water STOP
START UNK move around that rock all day , following the shade STOP
START during the UNK part of the day , of course , the sun comes straight down and there isn't any shade '' STOP
START we drove close to the UNK , stopped the land UNK , and walked over toward the family STOP
START the man was UNK against the rock STOP
START he UNK away from us as we approached STOP
START he was over six feet tall and very thin STOP

START there was something about his face that disturbed me and it took several UNK to realize what STOP
START it was not merely that UNK were UNK over his face but his UNK UNK did not UNK when the UNK UNK into his eye UNK STOP

START there was also a long wooden UNK and a UNK , a UNK device which gives the UNK an enormous velocity and high accuracy STOP
START there was also a UNK , UNK UNK STOP
START everything was UNK with UNK and UNK so that all of the objects seemed to have been UNK from the same material and to be UNK STOP

START they UNK on their UNK with their heads bent far forward , their eyes only a few inches from the ground STOP
START they had located the UNK of a colony of UNK and as the UNK came out of the ground , the boys picked them up , one at a time , and UNK them dead STOP
START the tiny bodies , dropped onto a dry UNK , made a UNK as big as a small UNK STOP
START the UNK here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town UNK STOP
START the UNK at first was more surprising than UNK STOP
START it was also UNK familiar , for it was the UNK of the human body , but UNK UNK times because of the fact that the UNK never UNK STOP

START but that is a UNK and a UNK one STOP
START the UNK is sexual , but so UNK so that a UNK nose must deny it STOP

START UNK still UNK over our shoulders at the horizon STOP
START the UNK stopped trying to talk a UNK i could understand , and spoke strange words from deep in his chest STOP
START it was a fortunate time in which to build , for the UNK century was a great period in UNK art STOP
START the UNK , the tile and UNK makers , the UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK worked through UNK UNK and those of his UNK to UNK the city STOP
START UNK entering from the desert were UNK by what must have seemed an illusion : a great garden filled with UNK and UNK , cut by UNK and UNK UNK , UNK with water tanks of UNK tile in which were reflected the UNK blue curves of a hundred UNK STOP
START at the heart of all of this was the square , which one such UNK declared to be `` as UNK , as pleasant and UNK a market as any in the universe '' STOP
START in time UNK came to be known as `` half the world '' , UNK UNK STOP
START in the early eighteenth century this fantastic city , then the size of london , started to decline STOP

START UNK became more of a legend than a place , and now it is for many people simply a name to which they UNK their notions of old UNK and sometimes of the east STOP
START they think of it as a kind of UNK museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old UNK STOP
START those who actually get there find that it isn't UNK at all but as brilliant as a tile in UNK STOP
START but even for them it remains a museum , or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a UNK , a UNK in which UNK lies well preserved but indeed dead STOP
START everyone is ready to grant the persians their history , but almost no one is willing to UNK their present STOP
START it seems that for UNK , and especially for this city , there are only two times : the UNK past and the UNK , UNK , UNK present STOP
START the one apparent connection between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other have UNK and which naturally enough are called `` historical UNK '' STOP
START however , just as all the buildings have not fallen and UNK back to their original UNK , so the values which wanted them and saw that they were built have not all disappeared STOP
START the values and talents which made the tile and the dome , the UNK , the poem and the UNK , continue in certain social institutions which rise above the ordinary life of this city , as the great buildings rise above UNK walls and UNK UNK STOP
START often , too , the social institutions are UNK in these UNK and UNK and bridges , for these great structures are not simply `` historical UNK '' ; ; STOP
START they are the places where persians live STOP
START the UNK , for example , continues to take place on the UNK UNK , a UNK garden of plane and UNK trees that now serves as the UNK principal street STOP
START it takes place as well along the UNK and through the UNK of the UNK bridge , and also in the gardens of the square STOP
START on UNK , the day when many persians relax with poetry , talk , and a UNK , people do not , it is true , stream into UNK UNK -- a UNK and garden built by UNK UNK 2 , in the UNK century -- but they do UNK into hundreds of UNK throughout the city and up the river valley , which are smaller , more humble copies of the former STOP
START and of course religious life continues to center in the more famous UNK , and commercial life -- very much a social institution -- in the UNK STOP
START those three other great activities of the persians , the UNK , the UNK , and the UNK UNK ( the latter a kind of club in which a leader and a group of men in an UNK UNK move through a UNK of UNK , dance , UNK poetry , and music ) , do not take place in buildings to which entrance UNK are sold , but some of them occupy UNK examples of UNK domestic UNK : long , UNK , UNK rooms with UNK of UNK tile , their end walls cut through to the UNK and the sky by open UNK STOP
START but more important , and the thing which the UNK UNK and the blind UNK often do not see , is that these places and activities are often the UNK in which persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic UNK STOP
START water , air , fruit , poetry , music , the human form -- these things are important to persians , and they experience them with an intense and UNK awareness STOP
START i should like , by the way , to make it clear that i am not using the word `` persians '' UNK STOP
START i don't mean a few UNK who play about with UNK , like a young prince in a UNK UNK his hand in a pool STOP
START these things are important to almost all persians and perhaps most important to the most ordinary STOP
START the men UNK love poems in an UNK on any UNK night are as often as not the UNK , UNK UNK who spend most of their lives in and out of the local UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START a few months ago it was a fairly typical UNK who in the dead of night UNK me up a UNK to drink from a spring famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor STOP
START not long ago an UNK , a UNK water UNK of a UNK up from the UNK of the city , stood on the UNK UNK his first UNK in weeks STOP
START the air , he said , was just right ; ; STOP
START a UNK would taste particularly good STOP
START i really didn't know what he meant STOP
START it was a UNK day , granted STOP
START but he knew ; ; STOP
START he UNK the air and UNK it on his UNK and knew as a UNK knows a UNK STOP
START the natural world then , plus poetry and some kinds of art , receives from the most ordinary of persians a great deal of attention STOP
START the line of an UNK , the color of the skin , a UNK from UNK , the UNK of spring water , the long afternoon among the UNK which crowd the upper story of a UNK -- these things are noticed , judged , and UNK STOP
START nowhere in UNK is this rich aesthetic life of the persians shown so well as during the UNK at the UNK bridge STOP
START there has probably always been a bridge of some sort at the UNK corner of the city STOP
START for one thing , there is a natural belt of rock across the river bed ; ; STOP
START for another , it was here that one of the old UNK UNK came in STOP
START it was to provide a safe and UNK UNK for these UNK , and also to make a UNK for the city , that UNK UNK 2 , in about UNK built , of UNK UNK , tile , and stone , the present bridge STOP
START it is a UNK structure STOP
START from UNK it looks like a long UNK box laid across the river ; ; STOP
START from UNK , where the water level is much lower , it is a high , UNK UNK UNK STOP
START the top story contains more than thirty UNK separated from each other by UNK of blue and yellow tile STOP
START at either end and in the center there are UNK which contain nine greater UNK as UNK and UNK as church UNK STOP
START here , in the old days -- when they had come to see the moon or displays of UNK -- sat the king and his court while priests , soldiers , and other members of the party UNK in the smaller UNK between STOP
START below , twenty UNK UNK through the UNK of the bridge STOP
START these are UNK by another line of UNK , and thus rooms , UNK on all four sides , are formed STOP
START down through the axis of the bridge there is a long UNK UNK like a visual UNK of UNK and UNK , while the UNK UNK UNK and down frame the sunset and UNK , the mountains and river UNK STOP
START here , on the UNK day , it is cool beneath the stone and fresh from the water flowing in the UNK at the bottom of the UNK STOP
START on the UNK , or `` UNK '' , side these UNK give out onto UNK twice as wide as the bridge itself STOP
START from the UNK -- UNK in all -- broad UNK of steps UNK into the water or onto still more UNK barely above the level of the river STOP
START out of water , UNK , and tile they have made far more than just a bridge STOP
START on spring and summer UNK people leave their UNK and houses and walk up through the UNK of the city to the bridge STOP
START it is a great UNK STOP
START the bridge itself rises up from the river , UNK and enormous , like the outdoor set for an epic opera STOP
START UNK press along the UNK , down the steps , in and out of the UNK , UNK against it as though it were a UNK under UNK STOP
START all kinds come to walk in the UNK : merchants from the UNK UNK over a deal ; ; STOP
START a UNK UNK in a UNK and UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK who stand with the UNK of the blind , their eyes UNK with UNK and UNK ; ; STOP
START the old UNK UNK arriving in their ancient UNK ; ; STOP
START students , civil servants , UNK , musicians , UNK , and UNK STOP
START families go out to the edge of the UNK to sit on UNK around a UNK STOP
START below , people line the steps , as though on UNK , to watch the sky and river STOP
START above , in the UNK UNK of the UNK , boys sing the UNK of UNK and UNK , while at the very bottom , in the UNK , the UNK and UNK of the city UNK and UNK their UNK , drink UNK , play UNK , and dance STOP
START here in an evening persians enjoy many of the things which are important to them : poetry , water , the moon , a beautiful face STOP
START to a UNK their delight in these things may seem UNK , for persians UNK the golden UNK as much as any people STOP
START many of them , moreover , are beginning to UNK about the UNK of western UNK and to UNK the old life of the UNK merchant , the UNK , and the UNK STOP
START UNK , they take time out -- much time -- from the game of UNK and these new western experiments to go to the gardens and UNK STOP
START above all , they will stop in the middle of anything , anywhere , to hear or quote some poetry STOP
START poetry in UNK life is far more than a common ground on which -- in a society deeply UNK by UNK -- all may stand STOP
START it contains , in fact , their whole outlook on life STOP
START and it is expressed , at least to their taste , in a perfect form STOP
START poetry for a UNK is nothing less than truth and beauty STOP
START in most western cultures today these UNK have been sent away to the UNK and UNK STOP
START in UNK , where practically speaking there are no UNK or UNK or , for that matter , hardly any books , the UNK run free STOP
START it is perhaps difficult to conceive , but imagine that UNK on london bridge the UNK boys of the east end will UNK to sing UNK , UNK , shakespeare , and perhaps some UNK of their own STOP
START that , at any rate , is what happens at the UNK bridge STOP
START boys and men go along the UNK or to the UNK in the top UNK STOP
START here in these little rooms -- or stages UNK open to the sky and river -- they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they may know and sing them according to one of the UNK into which UNK music is divided STOP
START each mode is believed to have a specific UNK -- one UNK pleasure , another UNK , another love , and so on , to include all of the emotions STOP
START the UNK simply UNK the poem to a mode ; ; STOP
START for example , the mode of UNK to this UNK folk poem : `` they brought me news that spring is in the UNK and UNK blood the UNK UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START go , tell his UNK mother that her son fought with a thousand UNK , and he was one '' STOP
START or the mode of love to this UNK by a recent poet : `` know UNK , fair folk who UNK on earth or shall UNK come to birth , that here , with dust upon his eyes , UNK , the UNK UNK , lies STOP
START in this true UNK UNK UNK a world of love lies UNK STOP
START '' STOP
START these songs ( practically all UNK music , for that matter ) are limited to a range of two UNK STOP
START yet within this UNK there is an UNK variety : design as UNK as that in the UNK or UNK , with the UNK line like the painted or UNK line often flowing into an UNK STOP
START die UNK UNK UNK , UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK , the UNK quoted the flying UNK , as he told of his career and UNK , UNK that the number seven had significantly UNK in his life several times STOP
START the music director of the UNK symphony orchestra , william steinberg , has molded his group into a prominent musical organization , which is his life STOP
START when he added to his UNK commitments the UNK of the london UNK orchestra in 1958 , he conducted one hundred fifty UNK within nine months , `` UNK '' between the two cities STOP
START this schedule became too UNK , even for the UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START his london contract was UNK , and now , he explains UNK , as a bright smile UNK his intense , mobile face , `` i conduct only one hundred and twenty UNK '' ! ! STOP
START our meeting took place in may , 1961 , during one of the UNK UNK in new york , before he left for europe STOP
START as we began to UNK in the UNK of his fifth avenue hotel , his UNK and sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent STOP
START seeking an UNK , dark , relatively quiet corner in the UNK room otherwise UNK with afternoon UNK , he asked if the soft background music could be turned off STOP
START unfortunately , it was UNK , which automatically is UNK into the public rooms , and which UNK UNK had to be UNK STOP
START as he talked about himself , time and again UNK and UNK on his UNK , steinberg began to relax and the initial UNK feeling grew UNK and was UNK STOP
START did he come from a musical family ? ? STOP
START yes : though not professional musicians , they were a UNK family STOP
START in his native UNK , where his mother taught him to play the piano , he was able to read notes before he learned the UNK STOP
START she even devised a system of colors , whereby the boy could easily distinguish the different note values STOP
START when he started school at the age of UNK , he could not understand why the UNK begins with the letter a , instead of c , as in the scale STOP
START because , like many other children , he UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK , he composed his own studies STOP
START when he was eight he began UNK UNK STOP
START soon he was playing in the UNK municipal orchestra , and during world war 1 , , when musicians were UNK , he joined the opera orchestra as well STOP
START steinberg claims that these early years of orchestra participation were of UNK help to his career STOP
START `` by UNK the conductor '' , he says with a UNK in his eyes , `` i learned how not to conduct '' STOP
START the musician ran away from school when he was fifteen , but this UNK did not save him from the UNK STOP
START simultaneously , he UNK his musical studies at the UNK , receiving sound training in UNK and harmony , as well in the UNK and piano STOP
START his professional career began when he was twenty ; ; STOP
START he became UNK UNK personal assistant at the UNK opera , and a year later was UNK to the position of regular conductor STOP
START wasn't this an UNK young age to fill such a responsible post ? ? STOP
START yes , the UNK UNK STOP
START had he always wished to be a conductor ? ? STOP
START no , originally he had hoped to become a concert UNK and had even performed as such STOP
START however , when he assumed the duties of a conductor , he UNK his career as a UNK STOP
START five years were spent with the UNK opera , after which he was called to UNK by alexander UNK UNK , teacher of UNK UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START in 1927 he succeeded UNK as opera director of the german theater at UNK STOP
START during his UNK he also UNK guest UNK at the berlin state opera STOP
START two years later he became director of the UNK opera , where he remained until he lost this position in UNK through the rise of the UNK UNK STOP
START during these years the UNK conductor had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in germany STOP
START he had presented the first german performances of UNK UNK UNK and de UNK la UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK years were particularly UNK for his performance of UNK UNK soon after the berlin UNK under UNK UNK , and the world UNK of UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP
START at the UNK of his career , steinberg had dedicated himself to the UNK of contemporary music by UNK to do a UNK work every year STOP
START in UNK , too , he directed the museum and opera house UNK which , in addition to the standard UNK , UNK UNK like UNK piano UNK and UNK sixth symphony STOP
START because of the political UNK in germany in the UNK , steinberg was forced to UNK his activities to the jewish community STOP
START through the UNK jewish UNK he began to give UNK UNK in UNK , with UNK UNK UNK STOP
START as more and more jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional organizations steinberg united them into the UNK UNK orchestra , which also gave guest performances in other german cities STOP
START in UNK he accepted the leadership of the berlin UNK STOP
START in the fall of that year the best musicians of the berlin and UNK UNK UNK joined under the combined efforts of UNK UNK and steinberg to become the UNK orchestra -- now known as the UNK UNK orchestra -- with steinberg as UNK STOP
START in UNK , at the UNK of UNK UNK , steinberg left germany for the united states , by way of UNK STOP
START after he had spent the first three years in new york as associate conductor , at UNK UNK , of the UNK orchestra , he made numerous guest UNK throughout the united states and latin america STOP
START in 1945 he became conductor of the UNK UNK STOP
START seven years later he was asked to become director of the UNK symphony STOP
START since UNK he has also conducted regularly at the san francisco opera , where he made his UNK with a UNK performance of UNK UNK STOP

START he added that he also stresses the works of these favorite UNK on tour , especially UNK first and fourth UNK , and UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK , and UNK sixth -- which is rarely played -- and seventh STOP
START UNK eighth he refers to as `` my travel symphony '' STOP
START he UNK that in california after a critic had attacked him for `` still trying to sell UNK to the americans '' , the UNK response at the next concert was a standing UNK STOP
START `` now that UNK walter is virtually in retirement and my dear friend UNK UNK is no longer with us , i am probably the only one -- with the possible exception of UNK UNK -- who has this special UNK for and UNK the works of UNK and UNK '' STOP
START since he UNK so much modern music , i could not resist asking how he felt about it STOP
START `` there was always and at all times a contemporary music and it UNK the era in which it was created STOP
START but i usually stick to the old phrase : ' UNK UNK UNK UNK , UNK UNK UNK ( i hold an office , but i do not feel entitled to have an opinion ) STOP
START i consider it to be my job to UNK the public to what is being written today '' STOP
START with all his musical activities , did he have the time and UNK to do anything else ? ? STOP
START he had just paid a brief visit to the UNK collection to UNK his favorite paintings by UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START he was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired UNK UNK , but UNK with pleasure over a UNK exhibit he had been able to see in paris a year ago STOP
START and how did he feel about modern art ? ? STOP
START again steinberg was UNK and replied with a smile that he was not exposed to it enough to UNK comments STOP
START `` as my wife puts it '' , he said , again with a UNK in his eyes , `` all you know is your music STOP
START but after all , you never learned anything else '' ! ! STOP
START what did he do for UNK ? ? STOP
START like his late UNK , UNK , he UNK mystery stories , in particular sir arthur UNK UNK STOP
START he cited UNK and UNK as UNK in literature STOP
START but his prime interest , apart from music , he insisted seriously , was his family -- his wife , daughter and son STOP
START at the moment he was UNK about his UNK having received the UNK de rome in UNK and was looking forward to being present this summer at the UNK of an UNK UNK STOP
START `` both children are musical and my wife is a music UNK of UNK UNK and UNK '' STOP

START was the UNK for a UNK discussion at the UNK UNK in UNK STOP
START i was chairman , the only not UNK UNK STOP
START since attack serves to UNK interest in UNK , i added to my opening statement a sentence in which i claimed that german youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which is a necessary UNK of anger , and might be classified as UNK and UNK rather than angry STOP
START i was far from convinced of the truth of my statement , but could not think of anything that might UNK responses more quickly STOP
START `` it is easy for you to talk '' ; ; STOP
START UNK a twenty year old law student , `` you travel around the world STOP
START we would like to do that too '' STOP
START `` but you want a job UNK when you return '' , i continued my attack STOP
START `` you must have some security '' , said a young UNK STOP
START when i mentioned that for my first long voyage i did not even have the money for the return UNK , but had UNK to luck that i would earn a sufficient amount , the young people looked at me UNK STOP
START one girl expressed what was obviously in their minds STOP
START `` would you UNK us to act the same way ? ? STOP

START i think it is rather UNK to trust to luck '' STOP
START others mentioned that i might have had to ask friends or even UNK for help and that to be UNK in a foreign country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international understanding STOP
START the debate needed no additional controversy and soon i could ask each individually what he expected from life , what his hopes were and what his fears STOP
START though the four boys and two girls , the UNK nineteen years of age , the UNK UNK , came from varying UNK and had different professional and personal interests , there was surprising agreement among them STOP
START what they wished for most was security ; ; STOP
START what they UNK most was war or political UNK in their own country STOP
START the ideal home , they agreed , would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms , just enough for a family consisting of husband , wife , and two children STOP
START no one wanted a larger family or no children , and none hoped for a UNK or said that living in less settled circumstances would be satisfactory STOP
START all expressed interest in world affairs but no one offered to make any UNK to satisfy this interest STOP
START once again , as in the days of the founding fathers , america faces a UNK test STOP
START that test , as president kennedy UNK UNK it in his state of the union message , will determine `` whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can UNK '' STOP
START it is well then that in this hour both of `` national UNK '' and of `` national opportunity '' we can take counsel with the men who made the nation STOP
START UNK of UNK , the founding fathers found the crisis of their time to be equally grave , and yet they had confidence that america would UNK it and that a republic of free peoples would UNK and serve as an example to a world UNK for liberty STOP
START seven UNK -- george washington , UNK franklin , john adams , thomas jefferson , alexander hamilton , james madison and john UNK -- determined the UNK of the new nation STOP
START in certain respects , their task was UNK greater than ours today , for there was nobody before them to show them the way STOP
START as madison UNK to jefferson in UNK , `` we are in a UNK without a single UNK to guide us STOP
START our UNK will have an easier task '' STOP
START they thought of themselves , to use UNK words , as `` the UNK '' who had lived in `` the heroic age '' STOP
START accordingly , they took special UNK to preserve their papers as essential sources for UNK STOP
START their writings assume more than dramatic or UNK interest because of their conviction that the struggle in which they were involved was neither UNK nor UNK but , rather , as washington in his last UNK circular reminded his fellow UNK , that `` with our fate will the destiny of UNK millions be involved '' STOP
START strong men with strong opinions , frank to the point of being UNK UNK , the founding seven were essentially UNK minds , and their UNK with each other were more UNK than their differences STOP
START even though in most cases the completion of the UNK UNK of their writings is still years off , enough UNK has already been assembled to warrant drawing a new UNK profile of the leadership which performed the heroic UNK UNK of winning american independence and founding a new nation STOP
START before UNK them into a common profile it is well to remember that their separate UNK were extraordinary STOP
START certainly no other seven american UNK from any later period achieved so much in so concentrated a span of years STOP
START UNK of the seven , UNK franklin , a new UNK UNK to philadelphia , wrote the most UNK success story in our history STOP

START john adams UNK much of UNK radical UNK , wrote the constitution of his home state of massachusetts , UNK , with franklin and UNK , the peace with britain and served as our first vice president and our second president STOP

START such a statement would be the UNK form of UNK STOP
START but the south is , and has been for the past century , engaged in a UNK UNK which , UNK enough , is not reflected in its literature STOP
START in 1900 the south was only UNK urban ; ; STOP
START in 1950 it had become UNK urban STOP
START in a mere UNK the south has more than UNK its urban status STOP
START there is a new south emerging , a south losing the UNK traditions of an UNK society with the UNK of an UNK -- especially within recent decades STOP
START as the new south UNK toward further UNK , it becomes more and more UNK with the north -- a tendency which UNK UNK terms `` UNK '' , as evidenced in such cities as UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START it is said that , even at the present stage of southern UNK , such a city as atlanta is not UNK unlike UNK or UNK STOP
START undoubtedly even the old southern UNK UNK has felt the new wind : william UNK UNK in his latest novel an avenue named for UNK UNK , a civil war general , now UNK , in typical california fashion , `` UNK UNK UNK '' STOP
START the effects of television and other mass UNK are UNK regional UNK and UNK with a startling force STOP

START the field , then , is UNK for new southerners to step to the UNK and write of this UNK phenomenon , the southern UNK : the new urban economy , the UNK , the UNK of transition , the labor problems ; ; STOP
START the list is , obviously , UNK STOP
START but these sources have not been UNK STOP
START UNK UNK is still UNK in southern UNK , UNK the old southern UNK into something beautiful and UNK , but as UNK as -- or even more UNK than -- UNK STOP
START william UNK , while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy UNK , UNK he is not to be classified as a southern writer and yet includes traditional southern concepts in everything he UNK STOP
START even the great god faulkner , the UNK one probable UNK for literary immortality , has little concerned himself with these matters ; ; STOP
START such are simply not within his UNK UNK STOP
START where are the writers to treat these changes ? ? STOP
START has the UNK tradition become such an UNK that the switch to UNK is somehow UNK or UNK ? ? STOP
START perhaps present writers UNK UNK to the older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated UNK over the decades STOP
START lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to write of a new economy , these writers seem to be UNK themselves with an old one that is now as UNK as confederate money STOP
START an example of the changes which have UNK over the southern region may be seen in the southern UNK quest for a position in the UNK society , a problem that has been reflected in regional fiction especially since UNK STOP
START today the negro must discover his role in an UNK south , which indicates that the racial aspect of the southern dilemma UNK changed UNK , but rather has gradually come to be reflected in this new context , this new coat of paint STOP
START the negro faces as much , if not more , difficulty in fitting himself into an urban economy as he did in an UNK one STOP
START this represents a gradual change in an UNK social problem STOP
START but there have been abrupt changes as well : the UNK , the UNK lines , the bus strikes -- all of these were UNK even ten years ago STOP
START today's evidence , such as the fact that only three southern states ( south carolina , alabama and mississippi ) still openly UNK integration , would have UNK many of UNK southerners into UNK STOP
START other examples of gradual changes that have affected the negro have been his moving up , row by row , in the UNK ; ; STOP
START his UNK , and often getting , higher wages , better working conditions , better schools -- changes that were slowly emerging even before the supreme court decision of 1954 STOP
START then came this decision , which UNK the process of UNK UNK ( or perhaps UNK it ; ; STOP
START only historical evolution will determine which ) : an abrupt change STOP
START since 1954 the UNK desire for social justice has led to an UNK UNK UNK STOP
START he has frequently refused to move from white lunch UNK , refused to UNK local laws which he considers UNK , while in other cases he has UNK to federal laws STOP
START this UNK UNK , after decades of humble UNK , is indeed a UNK phenomenon , an abrupt change in the southern way of existence STOP
START a new order is UNK itself into being STOP
START a new south is emerging after the UNK years of UNK , uncertainty , and lack of action from the negro in UNK his new role in the UNK defined UNK organizations of the white man STOP
START the modern negro has not made a decisive UNK into southern fiction STOP
START it is clear that , while most writers enjoy UNK the negro as a UNK , humble old UNK who UNK `` UNK '' and `` UNK UNK '' with UNK UNK to his white UNK ( or , in old south terms , `` UNK '' ) , this UNK is UNK to become in reality as UNK as UNK UNK STOP
START while there may still be many UNK UNK UNK scattered through the rural south , such men appear to be a UNK breed STOP
START writers openly admit that the negro is easier to write than the white man ; ; STOP
START but they obviously mean by this , not a negro personality , but a negro type STOP
START UNK an UNK negro character , it would seem , is one of the most difficult assignments a southern writer could UNK ; ; STOP
START and the success of such an UNK is , as suggested above , UNK rare STOP
START just as the negro situation points up the gradual and abrupt changes UNK southern life , it also points up the UNK of UNK in southern literature STOP
START the book concerned with the UNK role in an urban society is rare indeed ; ; STOP
START recently only UNK UNK novel , UNK lane , has openly faced the problem STOP
START all but the most UNK of confederate UNK UNK admit that the old southern tradition is UNK in UNK and UNK that its passing was accompanied by the UNK of many UNK and UNK traditions of the UNK UNK UNK way of life STOP
START many earlier writers , UNK the UNK of the old order , tended to UNK and UNK this `` UNK old south '' UNK , creating such UNK impressions as UNK UNK `` UNK '' plantation STOP
START modern writers , who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the UNK of their subjects , insist upon drawing out this legend , UNK its UNK , when it well UNK a rest after the UNK of the past century STOP
START perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this UNK ; ; STOP
START but they can hardly deny that , UNK or not , the old UNK is dead STOP
START as john UNK says in his article , `` UNK of southern UNK '' ( southwest review , winter 1957 ) : `` the UNK UNK where an old south , already too UNK UNK in prose and poetry , should be left to rest in peace , forever dead and ( let us UNK hope ) forever done with '' STOP
START UNK further UNK the southern UNK creation of an UNK image of their UNK , which is too readily UNK by both foreign readers and visiting UNK : `` our UNK is UNK of all this UNK evidence ( of UNK ) presented to his UNK STOP
START it UNK and UNK him STOP
START he is too deeply UNK in william faulkner and robert UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK of progress are in his nose and the bright steel of industry UNK before his eyes , but his heart is away in UNK county with UNK UNK and night UNK STOP
START on this trip to the south he wants , above all else , to UNK the UNK of UNK UNK and to see at least one UNK UNK at UNK '' STOP
START obviously , such a northern UNK purpose is somewhat UNK to a child's experience with UNK : he wants to see a world of UNK STOP
START in the UNK , while the south has been UNK this UNK modernization that is so UNK to the curious UNK , southern writers have certainly done little to reflect and promote their UNK progress STOP
START UNK UNK , in his new book , american writing in the twentieth century , UNK , quite UNK it seems : `` certain subjects are UNK absent or have been only lightly UNK STOP
START no southern novelist has done for atlanta or UNK what UNK , UNK , and UNK did for chicago or UNK UNK did for new york STOP
START there are almost no fictional treatments of the UNK south '' STOP
START not a single southern author , major or minor , has made the urban problems of an urban south his primary source material STOP
START faulkner , for one , appears to be safe from the UNK fingers of all UNK in this regard STOP
START faulkner UNK the southern legend perhaps more UNK than it has ever been , or could ever be , done STOP
START he has made it his , and his it remains , UNK STOP
START he UNK it with a mythological , universal application STOP
START as his UNK UNK , even though his emphasis is elsewhere , faulkner does show his awareness of the changing order of the south quite UNK , as can be UNK by a quick UNK of his UNK and UNK families STOP
START even two decades ago in go down , UNK faulkner was looking to the more urban future with a UNK of hope that through its youth and its new way of life the south might be UNK and the UNK of slavery UNK from its soil STOP
START yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing UNK order in general , and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact STOP
START faulkner UNK , in his vast and UNK UNK of UNK county , the gradual changes which UNK into the south , building layer upon layer of minute , subtle UNK which eventually tend largely to UNK the old way STOP
START thus faulkner UNK us , and UNK , that the `` new '' south has gradually UNK out of the old south , and consequently its UNK roots UNK STOP
START yet he presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers if not himself : the problems with which a new south must UNK in UNK through a blind adolescence into the maturity of UNK STOP
START with new UNK the modern UNK must perform the work of six men : a machine stands between the UNK and his soil STOP
START the thousands of city UNK who desert the UNK UNK must UNK with even greater stress and tension : the sacred UNK is gradually UNK to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas STOP
START another element to concern the UNK is that of the visual devices of the theatre STOP
START most UNK UNK , true to their interest in the UNK of pure movement , have tended to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors ( often black ) and to give them a UNK UNK for a setting STOP
START but robert UNK , the UNK artist , has UNK with several of them STOP
START he has designed a matching UNK and UNK of points of color on white for UNK UNK , so that dancers and background UNK into a UNK unity STOP
START for UNK images and UNK she made some UNK UNK that UNK UNK and reveal the UNK , and a UNK UNK UNK with grass STOP
START UNK has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of UNK and UNK STOP
START in fact , he calls his UNK UNK works of motion , shape , light , and sound STOP
START to raise the dancer out of his personal , UNK self , UNK has UNK with relating him to a larger , UNK orbit STOP
START he began with UNK to make the dancer identify himself with the UNK he appeared to be STOP
START he went on to use objects -- UNK , UNK , UNK -- which he employed as UNK of the body of the dancer , who moved with them STOP
START the UNK continued as the dancer was further UNK by the play of lights upon his figure STOP
START in each case , the object , the color , even the UNK sounds of the electronic score were designed to become part of the UNK being of the UNK STOP
START the dancer who never UNK her hold on a UNK , begins to feel that it is part of herself STOP
START or , UNK from head to UNK in fabric UNK over a series of UNK , the UNK may well lose his sense of self in being a `` UNK '' STOP
START as the dancer is UNK , his UNK are UNK , and the combined elements give birth to a new being STOP
START from this being come new movement ideas that UNK dancer and property as a single unit STOP
START thus , the UNK UNK have extended the scope of materials available for dance composition STOP
START but , since they have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity , how are they to UNK the impressive UNK of materials at their disposal ? ? STOP
START some look deliberately to devices used by UNK in the other arts and apply corresponding methods to their own work STOP
START others , less UNK but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times , experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet , painter , and musician STOP
START an approach that has UNK to some UNK is UNK of charles UNK statement of the process of UNK verse : `` one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception '' STOP
START the creator UNK his intuition to lead him along a path that has internal validity because it UNK the reality of his experience STOP
START he UNK external restrictions -- conventional UNK , traditional UNK STOP
START the unit of form is determined UNK : `` the heart , by the way of the breath , to the line '' STOP
START the test of form is UNK to the experience , a UNK also accepted by the abstract UNK UNK STOP
START an earlier but still influential school of painting , UNK , had suggested the way of dealing with the dream experience , that event in which seemingly UNK objects are linked together through the curious associations of the UNK STOP
START the resulting picture might appear a UNK of UNK UNK and UNK , but it is more true to life than a portrait of an UNK UNK order STOP
START the contemporary painter tends to UNK not the concrete objects of his experience but their UNK as revealed in UNK of their lines , colors , masses , and energies STOP
START he is still concerned , however , with a personal event STOP
START he UNK the UNK of his UNK because they provide evidence of the UNK of the experience of creation STOP
START the work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience STOP
START some UNK have less interest in the experience of the moment , with its UNK UNK and UNK , than in looking beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher , more UNK level of truth STOP
START rather than putting their trust in UNK UNK they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design , which UNK an order more real than the UNK of the UNK world STOP
START the concept remains subjective STOP
START but in this approach it is the UNK ultimate insight , rather than his immediate impressions , that gives form to the work STOP
START others look to more objective devices of order STOP
START the musician UNK the UNK technique of composition UNK a mathematical system of UNK that , once set in motion , determines the sequence of UNK and even of UNK and UNK STOP
START the composer may reverse or UNK the order of his original set of intervals ( or UNK or dynamic changes ) STOP
START he may even UNK the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers STOP
START but he cannot order his elements by will , either rational or inspired STOP
START the system works as an UNK mechanism STOP
START musicians who use the chance method also UNK subjective control of formal development STOP
START again , the composer must select his own materials STOP
START but a UNK of UNK , with perhaps the added UNK of reference to the UNK of the i UNK , the chinese book of changes , UNK the handling of the chosen materials STOP
START UNK UNK , seeking new forms of continuity for their new UNK of movements , have turned to similar approaches STOP
START some let UNK take their form from the experience of creation STOP
START according to UNK UNK , `` the becoming , the process of realization , is the dance '' STOP
START the process UNK that the UNK sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that he feel the UNK of the quality that is to follow it STOP
START the sequence may involve a sharp contrast : for example , a quiet UNK UNK of the body succeeded by a violent UNK ; ; STOP
START or it may involve more subtle distinctions : the UNK may be gradually UNK or UNK , its UNK emphasis may be slightly modified , or it may be transferred to become a movement of only the arms or the head STOP
START even the least UNK will change the quality STOP
START an exploration of these possible relationships UNK the process of creation and thereby gives form to the dance STOP
START the approach to the UNK of the experience of creation may be analytic , as it is for miss UNK , or spontaneous , as it is for UNK UNK STOP
START she , too , is concerned with `` the becoming , the process of realization '' , but she does not think in terms of subtle variations of UNK or UNK patterns STOP
START the design is determined UNK : `` i must reach into myself for the spring that will send me UNK UNK into the chaos of event with which the dance UNK me '' STOP
START looking back , miss UNK feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of jackson UNK STOP
START at one time she felt UNK to make UNK that `` moved all over the stage '' , much as UNK paintings move UNK over the full extent of the UNK STOP
START but her conscious need was to break away from UNK patterns of form , a need to let the experience shape itself STOP
START UNK UNK also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling UNK by an initial movement STOP
START it may be a free UNK UNK of the leg , leading to a UNK UNK of the arm that UNK into a turn and the UNK of taking off from the ground STOP
START this became a dance called UNK to flight STOP
START a UNK quality of free UNK and a building from turns close to the ground towards UNK into the air gives the work its central focus STOP
START UNK UNK objects to art as an UNK of personal emotion STOP
START he UNK to make his dancers more `` UNK '' by relating them to the UNK elements of shape , light , color , and sound STOP
START if his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures from UNK , this is consistent with his intention of placing them in the orbit of another world , a world in which they are UNK of their UNK UNK STOP
START it is through the UNK dancer that the UNK of form is discovered STOP
START in his recognition of his UNK self the dancer moves , and this self , in the `` first revealed UNK of its existence '' , states the theme from which all else must follow STOP
START the theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes UNK STOP
START it may be a reaction to a UNK sound , the following movements UNK further reactions STOP
START it may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color , in which case changes in the light or color will set off a UNK of visual designs STOP
START UNK with the practical function of his actions , the dancer is UNK exclusively in their `` UNK content '' STOP
START movements UNK freely because they are UNK by emotional UNK or UNK drive STOP
START but the UNK must come first STOP
START though he is also concerned with UNK dance from UNK UNK of activity , UNK UNK has selected a very different method for achieving his aim STOP
START he UNK all UNK UNK continuity , any line of action related to the concept of cause and effect STOP
START he bases his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything STOP
START an order can be UNK rather than chosen , and this approach produces an experience that is `` free and discovered rather than bound and remembered '' STOP
START thus , there is UNK not only in the individual movements of the dance but in the shape of their continuity as well STOP
START chance , he finds , UNK him to create `` a world beyond imagination '' STOP
START he UNK with pleasure the comment of a lady , who UNK after a concert : `` why , it's extremely interesting STOP
START but i would never have thought of it myself '' STOP
START the sequence of movements in a UNK dance is unlike any sequence to be seen in life STOP
START at one side of the stage a dancer UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START nearby , another UNK UNK , while still another is UNK an UNK STOP
START a man and a girl happen to meet ; ; STOP
START they look straight at the audience , not at each other STOP
START he UNK her , puts her down , and UNK off , neither pleased nor disturbed , as if nothing had happened STOP
START if one dancer UNK another , the victim may do a UNK , sit down , or offer his UNK a UNK and UNK STOP
START events occur without apparent reason STOP
START their consequences are UNK -- or there are no consequences at all STOP
START the sequence is determined by chance , and UNK makes use of any one of several chance devices STOP
START he may UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START he may take UNK of paper from a UNK bag STOP
START the answers derived by these means may determine not only the UNK organization of the dance but also its UNK design , special UNK UNK the location on the stage where the movement is to be performed STOP
START the other variables include the dancer who is to perform the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance STOP
START the only factors that are personally set by the UNK are the movements themselves , the number of the dancers , and the approximate total UNK of the dance STOP
START the `` approximate '' is important , because even after the order of the work has been established by the chance method , the result is not UNK STOP
START each performance may be different STOP
START if a work is divided into several large UNK , a UNK drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the UNK for any particular performance STOP
START and any sequence can not only change its positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether STOP
START UNK UNK not to UNK the chance method ; ; STOP
START he UNK to its UNK as UNK as he can STOP
START however , there is always the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible to UNK STOP
START then the UNK must UNK STOP
START he must UNK matters so that two UNK do not UNK into each other STOP
START he must construct UNK so that a dancer who is told to lie UNK one second and to UNK UNK the next will have some physical preparation for the UNK STOP
START the north and the south were in greater agreement on sovereignty , through all their dispute about it , than were the founding fathers STOP
START the truth in their UNK concepts was UNK by UNK of the UNK of UNK and UNK , and defended in the end by leaders of the UNK of lincoln and lee STOP
START the people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles , in understanding of and belief in the federal balance , and in love of their union STOP
START repeated efforts -- beginning with the missouri UNK of UNK -- were made by such master UNK as clay and UNK to UNK the difference UNK by UNK , rather than clear thought and UNK action STOP
START even so , confusion in this period gained such strength ( from UNK and other factors ) that it led to the UNK war of the nineteenth century STOP
START nothing can show more than this the UNK of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty STOP
START the present issue in UNK -- whether to UNK an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens -- UNK the american one of UNK rather than the one that was resolved by civil war STOP
START and so i would only touch upon it now ( much as i have long wanted to write a book about it ) STOP
START i think it is essential , however , to UNK here the difference between the two concepts of sovereignty that went to war in UNK -- if only to see better how UNK is our need today to clarify completely our far worse confusion on this subject STOP
START the difference came down to this : the southern states insisted that the united states was , in last analysis , what its name implied -- a union of states STOP
START to their leaders the constitution was a UNK made by the people of sovereign states , who therefore retained the right to UNK from it STOP
START this right of the state , its UNK contended , was essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of UNK power in the union government STOP
START the UNK of the union maintained that the constitution had formed , UNK , the united people of america , that it was a UNK among sovereign citizens rather than states , and that therefore the states had no right to UNK , though the citizens could STOP
START writing to speed on august 24 , UNK , lincoln made the latter point clear STOP
START in UNK terms whose UNK is startling today , he thus declared his own right to UNK STOP
START `` STOP
START we began by UNK that all men are created equal STOP
START we now practically read it , all men are created equal except negroes STOP
START when the UNK get control , it will read , all men are created equal except negroes and UNK and catholics STOP
START when it comes to this , i shall prefer UNK to some country where they make no UNK of UNK liberty -- to russia , for instance , where UNK can be taken pure , without the base UNK of UNK '' ( his emphasis ) STOP
START STOP
START when the southern states exercised their `` right to UNK '' , they formed what they UNK UNK `` the confederate states of america '' STOP
START UNK , as we have seen , still UNK this government , along with the articles of UNK of UNK , as an example of a UNK STOP
START the fact is that the southern UNK UNK from the earlier one almost as much as the federal constitution did STOP
START the confederate constitution UNK much of the federal constitution UNK , and most of the rest in substance STOP
START it operated on , by and for the people individually just as did the federal constitution STOP
START it made substantially the same division of power between the central and state governments , and among the executive , legislative and judicial branches STOP
START the difference between UNK and federal union in UNK STOP
START many believe -- and UNK -- that the great difference between the constitution of the southern UNK and the federal constitution was that the former recognized the right of each state to UNK STOP
START but though each of its members had asserted this right against the union , the final constitution which the UNK signed on march 11 -- nearly a month before UNK began -- included no explicit provision UNK a state to UNK STOP
START its UNK discussed this vital point but left it out of their constitution STOP
START their president , jefferson davis , interpreted their constitution to mean that it `` UNK of no UNK association '' , but this remained so doubtful that `` there were frequent demands that the right to UNK be put into the constitution '' STOP
START the constitution of the southern `` UNK '' UNK from that of the federal union only in two important respects : it openly , UNK , recognized slavery -- an institution which the southerners of UNK , even though they continued it , found so impossible to UNK with freedom that they carefully avoided UNK the word in the federal constitution STOP
START they recognized that slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest , and that to recognize it UNK in their constitution would be in UNK UNK to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in the declaration of UNK that `` all men are created equal , that they are UNK by their creator with certain UNK rights , that among them are life , liberty and the UNK of happiness STOP
START '' the other important difference between the two UNK was that the president of the UNK held office for six ( instead of four ) years , and was limited to one term STOP
START these are not , however , differences in federal structure STOP
START the only important differences from that UNK , between the two UNK , lies in their UNK STOP
START the one of UNK made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states , whereas the UNK of UNK expressed , as clearly as language can , the opposite concept , that they were acting directly as citizens STOP
START here are the two UNK : federal constitution , UNK STOP
START `` we the people of the united states , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic UNK , provide for the common UNK , promote the general welfare , and secure the UNK of liberty to ourselves and our UNK , do UNK and establish this constitution for the united states of america '' STOP
START confederate constitution , UNK STOP
START `` we the people of the confederate states , each state acting in its sovereign and independent character , in order to form a permanent federal government , establish justice , insure domestic UNK , and secure the UNK of liberty to ourselves and our UNK -- UNK the favor and the guidance of UNK god -- do UNK and establish this constitution for the confederate states of america '' STOP
START one is UNK to say that , on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two UNK , the worst war of the nineteenth century was fought STOP
START but though the southern states , when UNK a constitution to UNK themselves , UNK the difference to this fine point by UNK to assert the right to UNK , the fact remained that by UNK from the union they had already UNK on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states STOP
START if the union UNK this to them , the same right must be UNK to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to UNK : this would destroy the federal balance between it and the states , and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their union STOP
START lincoln saw that the act of UNK made the issue for the union a vital one : whether it was a union of sovereign citizens that should continue to live , or an association of sovereign states that must fall UNK either to `` UNK or UNK '' STOP
START much as he UNK slavery , lincoln was always willing to UNK to each `` slave state '' the right to decide independently whether to continue or end it STOP
START though his election was interpreted by many southerners as the UNK of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the union , lincoln himself proposed no such change in the rights the constitution gave the states STOP
START after the war began , he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by union action even in the UNK states that stayed with the union STOP
START he issued his emancipation proclamation only when he felt that necessity left him no other way to save the union STOP
START in his message of december 2 , UNK , he put his purpose and his policy in these words -- which i would call the lincoln law of UNK : `` in giving freedom to the slave , we assure freedom to the free '' STOP
START what lincoln could not UNK was that the states rather than the people were sovereign in the union STOP
START he fought to the end to preserve it as a `` government of the people , by the people , for the people '' STOP
START the truth on each side won in the civil war STOP
START the fact that the americans who UNK the sovereignty of their states did this in order to keep many of their people more UNK in slavery -- the UNK of individual liberty -- made the conflict UNK , and the greater STOP
START out of this UNK the citizen emerged , in the south as in the north , as america's true sovereign , in `` a new birth of freedom '' , as lincoln promised STOP
START but before this came about , UNK americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states STOP
START on their decisive UNK lincoln did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the `` brave men , living and dead , who fought here '' STOP
START he understood that both sides were at UNK , and he reached the height of saying so UNK in his second UNK STOP
START to my knowledge , lincoln remains the only head of state and UNK who , while fighting a UNK war whose issue was in doubt , proved man enough to say this publicly -- to give his UNK the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there is some error , and in all our error , some truth STOP
START so great a man could not but understand , too , that the thing that moves men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought , which their UNK see and attack , but the truth which the latter do not see -- any more than they see the error which UNK the truth they themselves UNK STOP
START it is much less difficult now than in UNK day to see that on both sides sovereign americans had given their lives in the civil war to maintain the balance between the powers they had UNK to the states and to their union STOP
START they UNK in the balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen -- but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental truth : that individual life , liberty and happiness depend on a right balance between the two -- and on the UNK of sovereignty , in all its aspects , which this involves STOP
START the UNK americans who gave `` the last full measure of devotion '' to prevent UNK , preserved individual freedom in the united states from the UNK of UNK , inherent in UNK , which throughout history have proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states , and to the UNK of their people STOP
START but the fact that UNK other americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept served UNK in other essential ways STOP
START its appeal from UNK to bullets at fort UNK ended by UNK the southerners their right to have slaves -- a right that was even less compatible with the sovereignty of man STOP
START the very fact that they came so near to winning by the wrong method , war , led directly to their losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for , since it forced lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure STOP
START there was a divine justice in one wrong thus UNK another STOP
START there was also a lesson , one that has served ever since to keep americans , in their UNK with one another , from turning from the UNK to the bullet STOP
START yet though the southern states lost the worst errors in their case , they did not lose the truth they fought for STOP
START the lives so many of them gave , to UNK what they believed would be a fatal UNK by the union on the powers reserved to their states have continued ever since to UNK all americans against UNK other UNK STOP
START as cells UNK into UNK , they built new `` UNK '' and UNK controlled UNK to cope even more successfully with the UNK properties of the external world STOP
START the useful suggestion of professor david UNK which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution UNK quite UNK then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building UNK artificial UNK STOP
START one UNK about its UNK to people STOP
START will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and UNK UNK built a structure of UNK which UNK it to UNK to a sea of molecular interaction ? ? STOP
START the answer is , of course , yes STOP
START for the family is the UNK example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some UNK from , and a way of dealing with , other people STOP
START social invention did not have to UNK social theory any more than use of the UNK of a fire had to UNK UNK or the UNK protection of a boat the formulations of UNK STOP
START but it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid UNK STOP
START we have ample light when the sun sets ; ; STOP
START the temperature of our homes is independent of the UNK ; ; STOP
START we fly through the air , although UNK UNK us down ; ; STOP
START the range of our voice UNK distance STOP
START at what stage are social sciences then ? ? STOP
START is the future of psychology UNK to the rich future of physics at the time of UNK ? ? STOP
START there is a UNK UNK between the notion of cause in copernicus and in UNK STOP
START and it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact STOP
START political theoretical understanding , although almost at a UNK during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a flood of UNK which increased the possibility for man to UNK with man STOP
START UNK government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK ownership , world courts , and the UNK power in world UNK are but a few examples STOP
START most of these , with UNK exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to UNK the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it STOP
START the most effective political UNK seem to make maximum use of natural UNK and are aware that UNK UNK can play only a minor part in the whole scheme STOP
START just as present technology had to UNK the UNK of physics , so one might expect that social invention will follow growing UNK understanding STOP
START we are UNK in the need of such invention , for man is still very much at the mercy of man STOP
START in fact the UNK of the UNK of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other STOP
START 3 , STOP
START i want , therefore , to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science , the connection between scientific understanding and fear STOP
START there are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to UNK our present fears STOP
START UNK has remarked : `` the reason why all UNK are so UNK by fear is that they see all UNK of things happening in the earth and sky with no UNK cause , and these they UNK to the will of god '' STOP
START perhaps things were even worse then STOP
START it is difficult to UNK the UNK fears of man STOP
START we get some UNK from a few UNK of childhood and from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever was STOP
START we are not now afraid of atomic bombs in the same way that people once UNK UNK STOP
START the bombs are as UNK as an automobile in a UNK STOP
START we are UNK about what people may do with them -- that some UNK UNK may `` push the UNK '' STOP
START i am certainly not adequately trained to describe or UNK on human fears , but there are certain features of the fears UNK by scientific UNK that stand out quite clearly STOP
START they are in general those fears that once seemed to have been UNK to prayer or ritual STOP
START they include both individual fears and collective ones STOP
START they arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group STOP
START often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was UNK determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes UNK STOP
START yet often fear UNK because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been UNK of the really decisive act STOP
START to say that science had reduced many such fears merely UNK the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and UNK STOP
START but a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be UNK STOP
START the frequently UNK UNK worry that the UNK hours might UNK to complete darkness apparently gave rise to a ritual and UNK which we still recognize STOP
START it is curious that even centuries of UNK of the UNK cycle did not UNK a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the UNK of the winter UNK STOP
START this and other fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually , first , with the ptolemaic system and its UNK concept of UNK and then , more firmly , with the UNK UNK of an universal force that could account UNK for both UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START this understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without UNK any controls STOP
START in fact , although we have UNK the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no UNK STOP
START there is still the remote possibility of UNK UNK STOP
START a UNK could fall on san francisco STOP
START solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or UNK STOP
START our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our former elaborate UNK with the appropriate action which , in this case , amounts to doing nothing STOP
START yet we no longer feel uneasy STOP
START this almost UNK example is nevertheless UNK , for there are some elements in common between the UNK fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war STOP
START we , in our country , think of war as an external threat which , if it occurs , will not be primarily of our own doing STOP
START and yet we obviously also believe that the UNK of the disaster depends in some UNK or at least UNK way on the details of how we UNK STOP
START what elements of our behavior are decisive ? ? STOP
START our weapons production , our world prestige , our ideas of democracy , our actions of trust or UNK or UNK or UNK ? ? STOP
START we have UNK off a war and , since our behavior has involved all these elements , we can only keep adding to our ritual without UNK to abandon any part of it , since we have not the UNK notion which parts are effective STOP
START i think that we are here also talking of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city STOP
START if an automobile were approaching him , he would know what was required of him , even though he might not be able to act quickly enough STOP
START with the group of boys it is different STOP
START he does not know whether to look up or look aside , to put his hands in his UNK or to UNK them at his side , to cross the street , or to continue on the same side STOP
START when confronted with a UNK or an UNK person i have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others STOP
START i believe that what i do has some effect on his actions and i have learned , in a way , to UNK with UNK , but certainly my actions seem to UNK more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment in physics STOP
START i am usually filled with an UNK that through some UNK slip all hell may break loose STOP
START our inability to explain why certain people are UNK of us frequently UNK the same kind of ritual and UNK STOP
START we are forced , in our behavior towards others , to UNK UNK successful patterns in UNK because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements STOP
START our collective policies , group and national , are similarly based on UNK , but here we often lack even the UNK successful UNK and are still engaged in UNK them STOP
START we use terms from our personal experience with individuals such as `` trust '' , `` UNK '' , and `` get tough '' STOP
START we talk about national character in the same way that copernicus talked of the UNK of UNK bodies to move in circles STOP
START we perform elaborate international UNK and UNK with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect STOP
START small wonder , then , that we fear STOP
START the achievements which UNK our fears of the UNK took place three centuries ago STOP
START what additional roles has the scientific understanding of the UNK and UNK centuries played ? ? STOP
START in the physical sciences , these achievements concern electricity , chemistry , and atomic physics STOP
START in the life sciences , there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease , in the mechanisms of UNK , and in UNK and physiological chemistry STOP
START the major effect of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and UNK a more UNK environment STOP
START in addition , our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed STOP
START even in UNK where detailed and UNK understanding is still lacking , but where some UNK are possible , as with UNK and weather and UNK , the appropriate kind of human action has been more adequately indicated STOP
START apparently the population as a whole eventually UNK enough confidence in the UNK of the scientists to UNK its procedures and its fears STOP
START how and why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject for study STOP
START in some areas , the progress is UNK than in others STOP
START in agriculture , for example , despite the advances in UNK , elaborate UNK tend to UNK along with a continued sense of the UNK of some natural disaster STOP
START in child care , the opposite extreme UNK ; ; STOP
START procedures change rapidly and UNK confidence probably UNK anything UNK by established psychological theory STOP
START there are many UNK in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear STOP
START much of the former extreme UNK associated with UNK and UNK and with death has disappeared STOP
START the persistent UNK of having a UNK child has , i believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control over this UNK , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it STOP
START in fact , the recent UNK about the use of UNK have introduced fears and UNK of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in this instance , science has UNK UNK our fears STOP
START in fact , UNK as science UNK any fear , it stems not so much from scientific UNK and UNK but from the fact that new UNK questions arise , which , until they are understood , create uncertainty STOP
START perhaps the most UNK example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease STOP
START the situation with regard to our attitude and `` control '' of disease contains close UNK to problems UNK us with respect to people STOP
START the fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear i have tried to describe STOP
START nothing like UNK , he arrived before the hour STOP
START his letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at UNK on sunday , and i came into the UNK as the UNK struck twelve STOP
START he was waiting STOP
START my wish to meet samuel UNK had been UNK by simple UNK and interest in his work STOP
START american newspaper UNK like to call his plays UNK STOP
START they find deep UNK in them STOP
START even so UNK a UNK as harold UNK of the nation has said that `` waiting for UNK '' is `` the UNK of the contemporary european UNK of despair '' STOP
START but to me UNK writing had seemed UNK with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that i could UNK neither with despair nor with UNK STOP
START could it be that my own eyes and ears had UNK me ? ? STOP
START is his a literature of defeat , UNK to the social crises we face ? ? STOP
START or is it relevant because it UNK us something useful to know about ourselves ? ? STOP
START i knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions , because a man is not the same as his writing : in the last analysis , the questions had to be settled by the work itself STOP
START nevertheless i was curious STOP
START my UNK was UNK a day or two before the interview by a conversation i had with a UNK teacher of literature , a UNK father , at a conference on religious drama near paris STOP
START when UNK name came into the discussion , the priest grew UNK and told me that UNK `` UNK life '' STOP
START that , i thought , is at least one thing i can find out when we meet STOP
START UNK appearance is UNK irish STOP
START the features of his face are distinct , but not fine STOP
START they look as if they had been UNK with an UNK UNK STOP
START UNK hair goes straight up from his UNK , standing so high that the top falls gently over , as if to show that it really is hair and not UNK STOP
START one might say it UNK the man ; ; STOP
START own pride and UNK STOP
START for he has the pride that comes of UNK and the UNK , perhaps of the same UNK , not to UNK himself upon another STOP
START his light blue eyes , set deep within the face , are UNK and continually looking STOP
START he seems , by some unconscious division of labor , to have given them that one function and no other , leaving communication to the rest of the face STOP
START the mouth frequently UNK into a UNK smile STOP
START the voice is light in UNK , with a rough edge that UNK to his UNK STOP
START the irish UNK is , as one would expect , combined with slight UNK from the french STOP
START his UNK suit was a UNK gray and green STOP
START he UNK a brown UNK sports UNK with no tie STOP
START we walked down the UNK de UNK , UNK along beside the UNK and across to a sidewalk UNK opposite that church STOP
START the conversation that UNK may have been UNK but it could hardly be called UNK STOP
START for one thing , the world that UNK sees is already UNK STOP
START his talk turns to what he calls `` the UNK '' , or sometimes `` this UNK confusion '' STOP
START i UNK his UNK from notes made immediately after our conversation STOP
START what appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words STOP
START `` the confusion is not my invention STOP
START we cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without being UNK aware of the confusion STOP
START it is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in STOP
START the only chance of UNK is to open our eyes and see the UNK STOP
START it is not a UNK you can make sense of '' STOP
START i suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth , but UNK did not take to the word truth STOP
START `` what is more true than anything else ? ? STOP
START to UNK is true , and to UNK is true STOP
START one is not more true than the other STOP
START one cannot speak UNK of being , one must speak only of the UNK STOP
START when UNK and UNK speak of a contrast between being and existence , they may be right , i don't know , but their language is too philosophical for me STOP
START i am not a philosopher STOP
START one can only speak of what is in front of him , and that now is simply the UNK '' STOP
START then he began to speak about the tension in art between the UNK and form STOP
START until recently , art has UNK the pressure of UNK things STOP
START it has held them at bay STOP
START it realized that to admit them was to UNK form STOP
START `` how could the UNK be admitted , because it appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be '' ? ? STOP
START but now we can keep it out no longer , because we have come into a time when `` it UNK our experience at every moment STOP
START it is there and it must be allowed in '' STOP
START i granted this might be so , but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously STOP
START and why not ? ? STOP
START how , i asked , could chaos be admitted to chaos ? ? STOP
START would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art ? ? STOP
START if we look at recent art we find it UNK with form STOP
START UNK own work is an example STOP
START plays more highly UNK than `` waiting for UNK '' , `` UNK '' , and `` UNK last tape '' would be hard to find STOP
START `` what i am saying does not mean that there will UNK be no form in art STOP
START it only means that there will be new form , and that this form will be of such a type that it UNK the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else STOP
START the form and the chaos remain separate STOP
START the latter is not reduced to the former STOP
START that is why the form itself becomes a UNK , because it exists as a problem separate from the material it UNK STOP
START to find a form that UNK the UNK , that is the task of the artist now '' STOP
START yet , i responded , could not similar things be said about the art of the past ? ? STOP
START is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it UNK us with something we cannot clarify , demanding that the UNK respond to it in his own UNK way ? ? STOP
START what is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory ? ? STOP
START isn't all art ambiguous ? ? STOP
START `` not this '' , he said , and UNK toward the UNK STOP
START the classical lines of the church which UNK thought of as a temple of glory , dominated all the scene where we sat STOP
START the UNK de la UNK , the UNK UNK , and the UNK UNK ran to it with UNK UNK , bearing UNK of the age of reason STOP
START `` not this STOP
START this is clear STOP
START this does not allow the mystery to UNK us STOP
START with classical art , all is settled STOP
START but it is different at UNK STOP
START there is the UNK , and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to answer '' STOP
START i asked about the battle between life and death in his plays STOP
START UNK and UNK UNK on the edge of UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK world is death and UNK may or may not get out of it to join the living child outside STOP
START is this UNK question a part of the chaos ? ? STOP
START `` yes STOP
START if life and death did not both present themselves to us , there would be no UNK STOP
START if there were only darkness , all would be clear STOP
START it is because there is not only darkness but also light that our situation becomes UNK STOP
START take UNK doctrine of grace given and grace UNK : have you UNK the dramatic qualities in this theology ? ? STOP
START two UNK are UNK with christ , one saved and the other UNK STOP
START how can we make sense of this division ? ? STOP
START in classical drama , such problems do not arise STOP
START the destiny of UNK UNK is sealed from the beginning : she will proceed into the dark STOP
START as she goes , she herself will be illuminated STOP
START at the beginning of the play she has UNK UNK and at the end she has complete UNK , but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark STOP
START that is the play STOP
START within this notion clarity is possible , but for us who are neither greek nor UNK there is not such clarity STOP
START the question would also be removed if we believed in the contrary -- total salvation STOP
START but where we have both dark and light we have also the UNK STOP
START the key word in my plays is ' perhaps ' '' STOP
START given a theological lead , i asked what he UNK about those who find a religious significance to his plays STOP
START `` well , really there is none at all STOP
START i have no religious feeling STOP
START once i had a religious emotion STOP
START it was at my first UNK STOP
START no more STOP
START my mother was deeply religious STOP
START so was my brother STOP
START he UNK down at his bed as long as he could UNK STOP
START my father had none STOP
START the family was protestant , but for me it was only UNK and i let it go STOP
START my brother and mother got no value from their religion when they died STOP
START at the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old school tie STOP
START irish UNK is not attractive , but it is deeper STOP
START when you pass a church on an irish bus , all the hands UNK in the sign of the cross STOP
START one day the dogs of UNK will do that too and perhaps also the UNK '' STOP
START but do the plays deal with the same UNK of experience religion must also deal with ? ? STOP
START `` yes , for they deal with distress STOP
START some people object to this in my writing STOP
START at a party an english intellectual -- so-called -- asked me why i write always about distress STOP
START as if it were UNK to do so ! ! STOP
START he wanted to know if my father had UNK me or my mother had run away from home to give me an unhappy childhood STOP
START i told him no , that i had had a very happy childhood STOP
START then he thought me more UNK than ever STOP
START i left the party as soon as possible and got into a UNK STOP
START on the glass UNK between me and the UNK were three signs : one asked for help for the blind , another help for UNK , and the third for relief for the war UNK STOP
START one does not have to look for distress STOP
START it is UNK at you even in the UNK of london '' STOP
START lunch was over , and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of paris UNK at us STOP
START the personal quality of samuel UNK is similar to qualities i had found in the plays STOP
START he says nothing that UNK experience within a closed pattern STOP
START `` perhaps '' stands in place of UNK STOP
START at the same time , he is plainly sympathetic , clearly friendly STOP
START if there were only the UNK , all would be clear ; ; STOP
START but there is also UNK STOP
START as a christian , i know i do not stand where UNK stands , but i do see much of what he sees STOP
START as a writer on the theater , i have paid close attention to the plays STOP
START harold UNK is right to say that `` waiting for UNK '' is a reflection ( he calls it a UNK reflection ) `` of the UNK and UNK of UNK present politics , UNK , and common way of life '' STOP
START yet it is not only europe the play refers to STOP
START `` waiting for UNK '' UNK even better in america than in france STOP
START the consciousness it UNK may have come earlier to europe than to america , but it is the consciousness that most `` mature '' societies arrive at when their successes in technological and economic UNK UNK them into a time of UNK the UNK ends of culture STOP
START america is now UNK europe in this `` mature '' phase of development STOP
START whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens as a result of the technological and economic UNK now going on in the countries of asia and africa , and also of course on how long the cold war remains cold STOP
START even UNK , for all his efforts to UNK a UNK morality in the sun also rises and a UNK to arms never maintained that sex was all STOP
START UNK fiction is supported by a `` moral '' UNK and in its search for ultimate meaning UNK at a religious UNK STOP
START and UNK , in UNK of the unconscious , UNK UNK against the UNK of the sexual motive STOP
START though sex in some form or other enters into all human activity and it was a good thing that UNK emphasized this aspect of human nature , it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of sex STOP
START `` all is not sex '' , declared UNK STOP
START man is not confined to one UNK for his vital energy STOP
START the creative urge , for example , UNK the body and the self STOP
START but for the beat generation all is sex STOP
START nothing is more UNK of the way of life and literary aspirations of this group than their attitude toward sex STOP
START for the UNK , like the UNK , is in opposition to a society that is based on the UNK of the sex UNK STOP
START he has UNK sex -- not UNK or UNK but pure , spontaneous , UNK sex -- to the rank of the UNK ; ; STOP
START it is UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , christ , the mysterious and divine UNK energy flowing through the body of the universe STOP
START jazz is sex , UNK is a stimulus to sex , the beat UNK is adjusted to the UNK release of the sexual UNK STOP
START UNK UNK , in the holy UNK , stresses that for the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure ; ; STOP
START it is a UNK , and their private language is rich in the UNK UNK of sexual reference so that they UNK in a UNK universe of UNK STOP
START the singular UNK force of their UNK against the UNK of UNK is illustrated by their refusal to dance in a public place STOP
START the dance is but a UNK ritual for the expression of UNK sexual desire STOP
START for this reason , too , their language is more UNK and UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK a sexual experience in which their whole being UNK STOP
START it is therefore not surprising that they resist the UNK of marriage and the trap of UNK , for like UNK they are determined not to UNK their sexual energy STOP
START they UNK to the underground of the UNK where they can UNK the UNK of UNK UNK STOP
START unlike the heroes and UNK of the lost generation , they UNK the art of `` UNK '' and `` UNK '' STOP
START that is reserved for the squares STOP
START if they avoid the use of the UNK , UNK UNK word it is because it is UNK ; ; STOP
START it is sacred STOP
START as UNK , the UNK of the beat generation , UNK : `` in the sexual act , the beat are filled with UNK , the divine power STOP
START this is far from the UNK , UNK UNK of the middle-class square in heat '' STOP
START this is the holy UNK these UNK of the UNK pursue , this is the UNK cosmic urge to which they respond STOP
START if UNK UNK is the UNK who has led them out of the egypt of sexual slavery , dylan thomas is the poet who offers them the UNK UNK of justification for their UNK in liquor , UNK , sex , and jazz STOP
START in addition , they have been converted to zen UNK , with its UNK of all that is `` natural '' and UNK alive , the sense that everything in the world is flowing STOP
START thus , UNK , the beat writers UNK to `` religious '' UNK : they are in search of UNK , the spiritual , the UNK , but not anything connected with formal religion STOP
START what they are after is the UNK vision STOP
START and zen UNK , though it is extremely difficult to understand how these internal UNK are UNK , helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through sexual release STOP
START the style of life chosen by the beat generation , the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as UNK their own , is designed to UNK the value of the sexual experience STOP
START jazz is good not only because it UNK UNK but because of its decided sexual effect STOP
START jazz is the musical language of sex , the UNK of the UNK ; ; STOP
START indeed , it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz , by UNK the UNK of his UNK , can have therapeutic value STOP
START that is why , the argument runs , the squares are so UNK of jazz and yet UNK UNK by it STOP
START instead of giving themselves UNK to the UNK release that jazz can give them , they UNK UNK or UNK with UNK or turn to UNK for satisfaction STOP
START thus jazz is UNK into something holy , the sacred road to integration of being STOP
START jazz , like sex , is a UNK STOP
START it is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative UNK in UNK man STOP
START the UNK of sex , combined with UNK and jazz , is intended to provide a design for living STOP
START those who are UNK UNK can become UNK alive and free , their UNK put at the service of the imagination STOP
START UNK in their UNK of all that makes for death , the beat UNK bid all men become cool UNK ; ; STOP
START let them learn to `` UNK '' freely , to let go , to become UNK themselves , and then perhaps civilization will be saved STOP
START the UNK , UNK from a society that is UNK UNK with a UNK drive , is concerned with his personal salvation in the living present STOP
START if he is the child of UNK , if he is the UNK victim of an age of atomic wars , then he will UNK only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil STOP
START he will not UNK his UNK desires but release the energy within him that makes him feel truly and fully alive , even if it is only for this brief moment before the UNK of UNK UNK on earth STOP
START that is why the members of the beat generation UNK assume the title of the holy UNK ; ; STOP
START they will destroy the UNK , UNK , UNK , and churches of the state that is the UNK enemy of the life they believe in STOP
START apart from the UNK UNK they derive from the metaphysics of the UNK , the only UNK they are capable of making is that art is their only UNK STOP
START their writing , born of their experiments in UNK and UNK UNK , reflects the UNK of their UNK alienation STOP
START the mind has UNK them , reason is the UNK of life ; ; STOP
START they will trust only their physical UNK , the wisdom of the body , the holy UNK of the unconscious STOP
START with UNK intensity they reveal what they hate , but their faith in love , inspired by the revolutionary UNK of jazz , UNK in the climax of the UNK STOP
START their work UNK the UNK of the UNK , UNK and UNK STOP
START their UNK against UNK society is not far removed from the violence of UNK characteristic of the UNK UNK STOP
START and the life they lead is UNK and for the most part UNK , even though they make a UNK of UNK themselves to some creative UNK -- writing , painting , music STOP
START they are UNK on principle STOP
START when they express themselves it is UNK UNK that UNK forth , the UNK of UNK , the UNK of UNK STOP
START it is sex that UNK them , sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic UNK STOP
START what they discuss with UNK UNK is the degree to which sex can UNK the UNK STOP
START UNK is the vice from which the UNK UNK middle class continue to suffer , whereas the UNK has the courage to break out of that prison of UNK STOP
START one girl describes her past , her succession of broken marriages , the UNK she has had and finally UNK that she UNK sex and sees no reason why she must justify her passion STOP
START if it is an honest feeling , then why should she not yield to it ? ? STOP
START `` most often '' , she says , `` it's the UNK relationship that is UNK '' STOP
START there is nothing holy in UNK STOP
START this girl soon drops the UNK UNK who UNK of her life STOP
START she finds married life UNK and every prolonged sex relationship UNK UNK STOP
START this UNK serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution : the UNK for UNK for its own sake , the need for change , for new experiences STOP
START UNK is death STOP
START in the realm of physical UNK , sex UNK supreme STOP
START hence the UNK UNK themselves on UNK , jazz , free UNK poetry , UNK themselves in UNK of sex ; ; STOP
START some of them are driven over the UNK of UNK and lose contact with reality STOP
START one beat poet UNK a poem , `` lines on a UNK john '' , which contains a few happy UNK for survival STOP
START the new fact the UNK of this UNK have to learn is that they must move toward simplicity STOP
START the UNK mission of this UNK generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry and fiction , but what they produce is unfortunately UNK , UNK solely on the UNK of UNK STOP
START who are the creative representatives of this movement ? ? STOP
START UNK , UNK , UNK , drug UNK , UNK , UNK , the weak , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK and UNK of society STOP
START they UNK independent UNK , usually with a `` UNK '' partner who will help support them STOP
START they are full of UNK for the institution of UNK STOP
START their previous UNK marriages do not count , for they hold the laws of the state UNK and UNK STOP
START they feel they are UNK against a hostile , UNK world , faced with the UNK UNK opposition of squares and their UNK , the police STOP
START this is the UNK of UNK the UNK use in UNK their way of life , their search for UNK , though their actual existence UNK to reach these `` religious '' heights STOP
START one UNK got the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and UNK and UNK sessions of sex that she was beginning to UNK up STOP
START what UNK had she picked up during these long nights of talk ? ? STOP
START sex as the creative principle of the universe , the secret of primitive religion , the life of myth STOP
START everything in the final analysis reduced itself to sexual UNK STOP
START in his chapter on `` the UNK of the beat generation '' , UNK UNK the reader none of the UNK details STOP
START no one UNK questions about the free union of the UNK in west UNK so long as the UNK share the negative attitudes of the group STOP
START the women who come to west UNK , having UNK UNK , are interested in living only for the moment , in being constantly on the move STOP
START others who are attracted to this UNK of the beat generation are UNK , UNK UNK , and UNK UNK STOP
START those who are sexual UNK are naturally drawn to join the UNK STOP
START since the UNK widely use UNK , they do not have to be initiated STOP
START part of the ritual of sex is the use of UNK STOP
START as UNK puts it : `` the UNK is felt in the magic circle of UNK with far greater force , as a UNK principle in human relationships , than at any other time except , perhaps , in the mutual metaphysical UNK STOP
START the magic circle is , in fact , a symbol of and preparation for the metaphysical UNK '' STOP
START under the influence of UNK the UNK comes alive within and experiences a UNK UNK sense of self as if he had discovered the open UNK to the universe of being STOP
START carried high on this `` charge '' , he UNK `` magical '' poetry that UNK the organic UNK of life in words STOP
START if he thus UNK a UNK , UNK , UNK intensity , he UNK the price for his UNK by producing work -- UNK UNK `` UNK '' is a striking example of this tendency -- that is UNK , UNK but without depth and without UNK control STOP
START for drugs are in themselves no royal road to UNK STOP
START how is the beat poet to achieve unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic UNK of UNK STOP
START if love reflects the nature of man , as UNK UNK UNK believes , if the person in love UNK UNK what he is by his behavior in love , then the writers of the beat generation are creating a new literary UNK STOP
START there were fences in the old days when we were children STOP
START across the front of a yard and down the side , they were iron , either UNK along the top or UNK in half circles STOP
START UNK fences were made of solid boards higher than one's head , but not so high as the golden UNK in a corner or the UNK that grew in a line against them STOP
START side fences were UNK beneath UNK and UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START front fences were covered with virginia UNK or UNK UNK or UNK STOP
START square UNK and gate posts were an UNK pattern of UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START they were UNK by UNK complete in every detail : UNK roof , UNK , and narrow UNK STOP
START on these posts the gates UNK open with a UNK and shut with a UNK UNK STOP
START the only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences was that obtained from an upper UNK of the UNK tree STOP
START the primary quality of that view seems , now , to have been its UNK , but that cannot at the time have impressed us STOP
START what one actually UNK is its UNK STOP
START from high in the tree , the whole block lay within range of the eye , but the ground was almost nowhere visible STOP
START one looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking wave of UNK STOP
START every path from back door to UNK was covered by a UNK , and every yard had its fruit trees STOP
START in the center of any open space remaining our UNK had UNK UNK and UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK STOP
START from above one could only occasionally catch a UNK of life on the floor of this green sea : a UNK UNK UNK UNK into sight for an UNK on the path beneath her UNK , or the movement of hands above a UNK and the UNK of UNK hung there , UNK down the block STOP
START that was one UNK : the UNK UNK STOP
START another had ended before it began STOP
START time is a UNK thing and memory a UNK ; ; STOP
START the UNK that time plays with memory and memory with time are UNK of all STOP
START from maturity one looks back at the succession of years , counts them and makes them many , yet cannot feel length in the number , however large STOP
START in a stream that turns a UNK there is a lot of water ; ; STOP
START the UNK is quiet , its surface dark and UNK , and there does not seem to be much water in it STOP
START time in the sum is nothing STOP
START and yet -- a year to a child is an UNK , and in the memory that phase of one's being -- a certain mental landscape -- will seem to have UNK without beginning and without end STOP
START the part of the mind that UNK dates and events may UNK , `` it could have been like that for only a little while '' ; ; STOP
START but true memory does not count nor add : it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time STOP
START once , then -- for how many years or how few does not matter -- my world was bound round by fences , when i was too small to reach the UNK tree UNK , to twist my UNK over it and pull myself up STOP
START that world was in scale with my own UNK STOP
START i have no picture in my mind of the garden as a whole -- that i could not see -- but certain aspects of certain corners UNK in the memory : UNK , UNK , white UNK beneath a window , with their UNK brown leaves and their sharp UNK of november ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK lying in long grass , to be turned over by a UNK foot , UNK , UNK bees still worked in the UNK , UNK holes ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK in the corner between the UNK wall and the side UNK , where we passed on our way to the UNK with the UNK tied to it as a cup by my UNK for our UNK pleasure in drinking from it STOP
START it was mother who UNK the UNK STOP
START i think that my UNK was not an UNK UNK : she was too UNK a UNK of dogs and UNK STOP
START my UNK , i have been told , made her garden her great pride ; ; STOP
START she UNK rare and UNK plants like UNK in UNK and UNK and UNK UNK in UNK that had to be UNK in the cellar ; ; STOP
START she filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the garden UNK in a corner by the UNK , and the UNK UNK along the west side of the house STOP
START these my UNK left in their places ( they are still there , more persistent and UNK than the UNK of man ) and UNK others like them , that UNK without careful UNK STOP
START three of these only were protected from us by UNK UNK : the UNK , whose UNK might not be collected until they had fallen , to be made into UNK or UNK to drink ; ; STOP

START more UNK a UNK to bring back that time of life than this record of a few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a UNK of the UNK which are of the very UNK of the mind , UNK , because they were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that held them STOP

START dead UNK birds , their UNK UNK and the UNK of decay that UNK to the hand when they had been UNK in our UNK in front of the UNK UNK STOP
START and the cast UNK of a UNK , UNK and UNK , UNK nothing , UNK but entire , with eyes like UNK and a UNK UNK down its back STOP
START every morning early , in the summer , we UNK the UNK of the trees as high as we could reach for the UNK UNK , carefully UNK their UNK UNK from the UNK where they hung , and UNK them , a UNK UNK herd , in an angle between the high roots of the UNK tree , where no grass grew in the UNK shade STOP
START we collected `` UNK UNK '' -- all the UNK UNK UNK , UNK smooth and round , that we could find in the UNK STOP
START when these had been UNK , we could still spend a morning cracking open other UNK for our delight in seeing how much UNK they were inside than their UNK UNK indicated STOP
START we showed them to each other and said `` would you have UNK '' ? ? STOP
START UNK on our UNK beside the flat stone we broke them on , we were safe behind the high closed gates at the end of the drive : safe from UNK and the observation and possible UNK of the UNK STOP
START thus UNK , we played many UNK games in comfortable UNK ; ; STOP
START even when the fences became a part of the game -- when a UNK UNK was the sleeping UNK UNK UNK , or when UNK let down her golden hair from beneath the UNK UNK , even then we paid little UNK to those who went by on the path outside STOP
START we enjoyed a UNK freedom when we were still too young for school STOP
START in the heat of the summer , the garden UNK were ours alone ; ; STOP
START our UNK stayed in the dark house or sat UNK on the front UNK STOP
START they never troubled themselves about us while we were playing , because the UNK formed such a definite boundary and `` don't go outside the gate '' was a command so impossible of UNK STOP
START we were not , however , entirely UNK with the varying aspects of the street STOP
START we were UNK to UNK on the gates , UNK they UNK on their UNK in a UNK way , but we could stand on them , when they were UNK , rest our UNK on the top , and UNK and UNK , UNK to memory , quite UNK , all the details that lay before our eyes STOP
START the street that is full now of traffic and UNK cars then and for many years UNK on an august afternoon in the shade of the UNK trees , and silence was a weight , almost UNK , in the air STOP
START every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell away again , UNK beneath it STOP
START a UNK moved slowly along the UNK , the top of it swept by the low UNK of the UNK trees , and loose UNK were left UNK UNK among the leaves STOP
START a wheel UNK on a UNK , was still , and UNK again STOP
START if a child watched its progress he UNK , `` hay , hay , load of hay -- make a wish and turn away '' , and then UNK UNK in the opposite direction until the sound of the UNK feet returned no more STOP
START when the hay wagon had gone , and an interval passed , a UNK UNK might turn the corner STOP
START the horse walked , the UNK were UNK , the UNK rode with UNK shoulders , his UNK across his knees STOP
START UNK , as if UNK to break the silence , he UNK his voice : `` UNK UNK fresh UNK today '' ! ! STOP
START the UNK UNK was UNK in time like the UNK of a UNK STOP
START no one seemed to hear him , no one UNK STOP
START the horse UNK on , and he repeated his call STOP
START it became so UNK as to seem a part of the UNK STOP
START after his passage , the street was empty again STOP
START the sun moved UNK across the sky and down ; ; STOP
START the UNK UNK UNK from street to sidewalk , from sidewalk to UNK STOP
START at UNK , or UNK , the coming of the UNK marked the end of the day ; ; STOP
START he UNK a paper toward every front door , and UNK came down to their steps to pick them up and read what their neighbors had been doing STOP
START the streets of any county town were like this on any UNK afternoon in summer ; ; STOP
START they were like this UNK years ago , and UNK STOP
START but the fences were still in place UNK years ago , and when we stood on the gate to look over , the sidewalk under our eyes was not UNK but two rows of UNK UNK with grass between and on both sides STOP
START the UNK was a line of stone laid UNK in the dirt and UNK this way and that by UNK in the ground or the roots of trees STOP
START opposite every gate was a UNK post or a stone UNK , set with a UNK iron ring for UNK a horse STOP
START the street was UNK and rose UNK toward the center ; ; STOP
START it was UNK in wet weather and dust , UNK , in dry , and could be crossed only at the corner where there were UNK UNK STOP
START it had a UNK atmosphere that it has lost long since STOP
START the UNK of cattle and the UNK of UNK feet in the UNK or in the dust were as numerous as the UNK of UNK horses STOP
START cows were kept in UNK UNK , boys were hired to drive them to and from the UNK on the edge of town , and familiar to the ear , morning and evening , were the UNK UNK UNK , the UNK of UNK , and the UNK of a stick on UNK STOP
START it is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story , because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and makes of them a curious , UNK UNK UNK but UNK significant for UNK work STOP
START the wife , UNK , and her UNK are both UNK UNK , she as UNK UNK , `` UNK '' and `` UNK '' , possibly `` a UNK UNK '' , with `` a kind of UNK UNK '' to set against her apparent simplicity , her `` UNK brain '' STOP
START UNK , for his part , `` UNK to the present-day race of small artists , who do not demand the UNK of themselves '' , and the bitter description of the type includes such UNK as `` UNK little UNK '' , the UNK UNK `` they do not know how to be UNK UNK and in order '' , and the somewhat extreme UNK , so far not UNK : `` they will be destroyed '' STOP
START the UNK these two play upon UNK reveals their want not simply of UNK but of imagination as well STOP
START his appearance as UNK UNK not UNK but UNK in the audience ; ; STOP
START it is a UNK absolutely painful , an UNK of the suffering flesh UNK by spirit , UNK by any spirit other than UNK and UNK STOP
START at the same time the multiple UNK involved -- the fat man as girl and as baby , as UNK UNK to be a baby -- UNK for a moment UNK upon the secret sources of a life like UNK , upon the UNK dreams which form the sources of any human life STOP
START the music which UNK has composed for this UNK is for the most part `` rather pretty and perfectly UNK '' STOP
START but it is characteristic of him , we are told , `` his little UNK '' , to be able to UNK `` into a fairly UNK and humorous piece of UNK a sudden phrase of genuine creative art '' STOP
START and this occurs now , at the UNK of UNK song -- at the point , in fact , of the name `` UNK '' -- ; ; STOP
START a UNK described as `` almost a UNK of genius '' STOP
START `` a UNK , a UNK , it was like a UNK suddenly UNK away to reveal something nude '' STOP
START it is this UNK which reveals to UNK his own UNK UNK and , simultaneously , his UNK UNK STOP
START by the same means he UNK this fact as having UNK itself to the audience ; ; STOP
START he UNK , and UNK STOP
START in the work of every artist , i suppose , there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive , ultimately UNK of what it is all about ; ; STOP
START not less UNK so for being mysterious , as though some deeply UNK UNK of thoughts were UNK in a single image , a single moment STOP
START so here STOP
START the UNK humor , the specifically sexual UNK of the UNK gone wrong , the UNK image of the fat man UNK up as a UNK UNK up as a baby ; ; STOP
START the UNK of that UNK flesh ; ; STOP
START the bringing together around it of the secret UNK between UNK , UNK UNK and sharp , UNK talent , UNK with an occasional touch of genius ( which , however , does not know `` how to attack the problem of suffering '' ) ; ; STOP
START the UNK way in which music , UNK and death are associated in a single UNK -- all this seems a UNK of art , a rather desperate art , in itself ; ; STOP
START beyond itself , also , it UNK numerous and distant UNK from the entire body of UNK work STOP
START when i try to work out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance , i come up with the following ideas , which i shall express very briefly here and UNK to in a later essay STOP
START love is the crucial dilemma of experience for UNK heroes STOP
START the dramatic construction of his stories UNK turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and UNK to love STOP
START the release , the freedom , involved in UNK another is either UNK difficult or else absolutely impossible ; ; STOP
START and the motion toward it brings disaster STOP
START this UNK on love has an especially UNK relation to art ; ; STOP
START it is particularly the artist ( UNK UNK , UNK , UNK ) who UNK from it STOP
START the specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the `` UNK '' in the realm of art STOP
START again , the UNK and UNK produced by any UNK against the UNK not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood , with the figure of a child STOP
START finally , the UNK ( and UNK UNK ) notions of UNK up , UNK , UNK , and especially change of UNK ( or UNK of UNK , as with UNK ) , are UNK associated with the UNK of UNK stories STOP
START we shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them UNK STOP
START for the present it is enough to note that in the UNK figure of UNK , at the moment of his UNK , all these elements come together in UNK UNK STOP
START UNK a lawyer , that is to say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself UNK up , UNK -- that is , UNK , revealed -- as a child , and , worse , as a UNK UNK as a child STOP
START that this UNK takes place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' performance , is enough to associate UNK with art , and to bring down upon him the punishment for art ; ; STOP
START that is , he is suspect , guilty , UNK , as is anyone in UNK stories who produces illusion , and this is true even though the constant elements of the UNK , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between UNK and UNK STOP
START it appears that the dominant tendency of UNK early tales , however UNK or even UNK the surface , is already toward the symbolic , the UNK , the UNK STOP
START in a certain perfectly definite way , the method and the theme of his stories are one and the same STOP
START something of this can be learned from `` the way to the UNK '' ( UNK ) , an UNK about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing UNK causes him to die of a UNK or UNK STOP
START there is no more `` plot '' than that ; ; STOP
START only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give STOP
START the artistic interest , then , lies in what the encounter may be made to represent , in the power of some central significance to draw the details into UNK and UNK STOP
START the first sentence , with its UNK UNK , UNK an UNK UNK : `` the way to the UNK ran along beside the UNK , ran beside it all the way to the end ; ; STOP
START that is to say , to the UNK '' STOP
START and the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction STOP
START the UNK , one might say at first , belongs to life , while the way to the UNK belongs to death STOP
START but that is too simple , and won't hold up STOP
START as the first sentence suggests , both roads belong to death in the end STOP
START but the UNK , according to the description of its traffic , belongs to life as it is lived in UNK of death , while the way to the UNK belongs to some other sort of life : a suffering form , an existence wholly UNK in the awareness of death STOP
START thus , on the UNK , a troop of soldiers `` UNK in their own dust and UNK '' , while on the UNK one man UNK alone STOP
START this man's isolation is not merely UNK , it is permanent STOP
START he is a UNK , his three children are dead , he has no one left on earth ; ; STOP
START also he is a UNK , and has lost his job on that account STOP
START his name is UNK piepsam , and he is rather fully described as to his clothing and UNK in a way which UNK him to a UNK type in the UNK UNK -- he is a UNK of those UNK UNK in `` death in UNK '' , for example , who represent some combination of UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START this strange person UNK with a UNK because the latter is using the path rather than the UNK STOP
START the UNK , a sufficiently commonplace young fellow , is not named but identified simply as `` life '' -- that and a license number , which piepsam uses in UNK him STOP
START `` life '' points out that `` everybody uses this path '' , and starts to ride on STOP
START piepsam UNK to stop him by force , receives a push in the chest from `` life '' , and is left standing in UNK and growing UNK , while a crowd begins to UNK STOP
START his UNK UNK a religious form ; ; STOP
START that is , on the basis of his own UNK and UNK UNK , piepsam becomes a UNK who in his UNK and in the name of god UNK UNK on life -- not only the UNK now , but the audience , the world , as well : `` all you UNK breed '' STOP
START this passion brings on a fit which UNK fatal STOP
START then an UNK comes along , and they drive UNK piepsam away STOP
START this is simple enough , but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant STOP
START the season , between spring and summer , belongs to life in its UNK aspect STOP
START UNK fatal UNK UNK not only because he cannot stop the UNK , but also because god will not stop him ; ; STOP
START as piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments : `` his justice is not of this world '' STOP
START life is further characterized , in UNK to piepsam , as animal : the image of a dog , which appears at several places , is first given as the UNK of UNK , UNK interest aroused by life considered simply as a UNK : a dog in a wagon is `` UNK '' , `` a pleasure to UNK '' ; ; STOP
START another wagon has no dog , and therefore is `` UNK of interest '' STOP
START piepsam calls the UNK `` UNK '' and `` UNK '' among other things , and at the crisis of his fit a little UNK stands before him and UNK into his face STOP
START the UNK is drawn by two `` UNK '' little horses STOP
START piepsam is not , certainly , religious in any conventional sense STOP
START his UNK is UNK , or UNK , connected with his UNK ; ; STOP
START the two may in fact be identical STOP
START his UNK UNK to give up drink are represented as religious UNK ; ; STOP
START he UNK a bottle in a UNK at home , and `` before this UNK UNK piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees , and in his UNK had UNK his tongue -- and still in the end UNK '' STOP
START the UNK , by contrast , UNK and UNK , is simply UNK , UNK life , `` UNK and UNK '' STOP
START `` he made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth '' STOP
START piepsam is UNK , a disturbing UNK ; ; STOP
START his end is UNK and UNK STOP
START he is `` a man UNK UNK on the way to the UNK '' STOP
START but he is more interesting than the others , the ones who come from the UNK to watch him , more interesting than life considered as a UNK STOP
START and if i have gone into so much detail about so small a work , that is because it is also so typical a work , representing the UNK form of a conflict which remains essential in UNK writing : the UNK sketch of piepsam contains , in its critical , destructive and UNK UNK , much that is UNK and illuminated in the figures of , for instance , UNK and UNK STOP
START in method as well as in theme this little UNK with its details selected as much for UNK and UNK as for `` realism '' , UNK a kind of musical composition , as well as a kind of fictional composition , in which , as UNK says , `` there shall be nothing UNK '' STOP
START it UNK , too , pictures such as UNK and UNK did , in which all that looks at first to be solely UNK UNK on inspection to be also literary , the representation of a UNK , for example , or a deadly sin STOP
START `` UNK UNK '' ( UNK ) UNK `` the way to the UNK '' in its representation of a conflict between light and dark , between `` life '' and a spirit of criticism , UNK , UNK , but it goes considerably further in UNK the elements of this conflict STOP
START the monk UNK , brought over from the renaissance and placed against the background of UNK at the turn of the century , UNK against the UNK works displayed in the UNK of UNK ; ; STOP
START in particular against a UNK UNK in a UNK style and UNK , according to UNK , upon the UNK UNK STOP
START UNK , like piepsam , makes his protest quite in UNK , and his UNK , though not fatal , is UNK and UNK ; ; STOP
START he is simply thrown out of the shop by the porter STOP
START on the street outside , UNK UNK a UNK of the UNK of this world , such a burning of artistic and UNK UNK as his UNK actually brought to pass in UNK , and UNK he issues his UNK : `` UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK et UNK '' STOP
START the `` reality '' to which they respond is UNK empty and their art is an imitation of the UNK UNK of this unknown and empty world STOP
START their artistic UNK is given to the witness of UNK STOP
START these UNK concerns ( imitation UNK ) reflect a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing over a long period of time STOP
START the UNK of classical structures of meaning in all UNK of western culture has given rise to several UNK of artists who have UNK the UNK processes STOP
START thus the image of man has suffered complete UNK in personal and spiritual qualities , and complete UNK in UNK and UNK powers STOP
START the image of the world tends to reflect the UNK and UNK of man or else to UNK into empty UNK and overwhelming mystery STOP
START the image of god has simply disappeared STOP
START all such UNK of negative quality have given rise to a UNK response in the form of a heroic and highly UNK UNK : if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at least UNK an artistic `` reality '' which is its own world and which can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved STOP
START the person of the artist becomes a final UNK of meaning in a world rendered UNK by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems STOP
START whatever UNK of this contrast one UNK and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually exclusive , that they belong together STOP
START without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been UNK into being STOP
START and although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves UNK for a UNK philosophy of art , their peculiar UNK in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written STOP
START for better or worse we cannot regard `` imitation '' in the arts in the simple mode of classical UNK or UNK realism STOP
START a broader concept of imitation is needed , one which UNK that true invention is important , that the UNK UNK in part UNK the UNK UNK factors out of which it UNK STOP
START on the other hand , we cannot regard artistic invention as pure , UNK , and UNK to the times in which it occurs STOP
START we need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the UNK and UNK of pure UNK STOP
START accordingly , it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation ( which i shall call mimesis in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation ) and a new theory of invention ( which i shall call symbol for reasons to be stated UNK ) STOP
START the UNK imagination in the arts STOP
START the word `` mimesis '' ( `` imitation '' ) is usually associated with plato and aristotle STOP
START for plato , `` imitation '' is twice removed from reality , being a poor copy of physical appearance , which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence STOP
START all artistic and mythological UNK , therefore , are `` UNK of UNK '' and are completely UNK by the truth value of `` UNK '' , the proper use of the UNK UNK STOP
START in plato's judgment , the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual powers STOP
START UNK in plato's system is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of UNK understanding is alone capable of UNK to the most UNK wisdom STOP
START aristotle also tended to UNK all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of UNK and , like plato , he put the pure and UNK UNK on the top level STOP
START the UNK , in UNK that all human arts are `` UNK of imitation '' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did plato STOP
START but aristotle kept the principle of levels and even UNK it by describing in the UNK what kinds of character and action must be UNK if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human UNK STOP
START for both plato and aristotle artistic mimesis , in contrast to the power of UNK , is relatively UNK of expressing the character of fundamental reality STOP
START the central concern of UNK UNK impressive volume called mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved STOP
START following the theme of UNK in the UNK , the christian artist and critic sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events `` figures '' of divine power and reality STOP
START here artistic realism involves the audience in an UNK participation in events whose UNK and implications are UNK STOP
START artistic mimesis under christian influence records the involvement of all persons , however humble , in a divine drama STOP
START the artist , unlike the philosopher , is not a removed observer UNK at neutral and UNK high levels of abstraction STOP
START he is the UNK of a sacred reality by which he has been UNK STOP
START i have chosen to use the word `` mimesis '' in its christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which , as in the christian mind , are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience , which are not reserved , as in the greek mind , only to moments of theoretical reflection STOP
START in the first instance , `` mimesis '' is here used to mean the UNK of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms of abstract ideas or conventional UNK STOP
START by `` image '' is meant not only a visual presentation , but also remembered UNK of any of the five UNK plus the feelings which are immediately UNK UNK STOP
START this is the primary function of the imagination operating in the absence of the original UNK stimulus by which the images were first UNK STOP
START mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual UNK of experience , in which the UNK person UNK through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself STOP
START the images themselves , like their counterparts in experience , are not neutral qualities to be UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START they are fields of force UNK a unique influence on the UNK and a unique UNK to one another STOP
START they bring an UNK component of value within themselves , with UNK and UNK native to their own quality STOP
START as in experience one is UNK by given UNK and their UNK and is forced to respond in value feelings to them , so one is similarly UNK in the UNK presentation of images STOP
START mimesis here is not to be confused with UNK or realism in the conventional sense STOP
START a word taken in its dictionary meaning , a photographic image of a UNK object , the mere UNK of a `` scene '' tends to lose UNK UNK and to UNK such conventional UNK as to UNK neutral reception without the UNK of value feelings STOP
START similarly experience itself can be UNK so that people react to certain UNK UNK for behavior without awareness of the UNK of their UNK field STOP
START a truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional UNK to a sense of UNK STOP
START the UNK character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials STOP
START when words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of UNK and sounds , when UNK of sound and colors of paint and the UNK shape all strike the UNK with an UNK force of data in and of themselves , UNK the observer into an attitude of attention , all this UNK the way experience itself in its UNK character strikes upon the door of consciousness and UNK for entrance STOP
START these are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and UNK the self into decision and choice STOP
START the presence of genuine mimesis in art is marked by the UNK with which the work demands attention and UNK UNK even though it is but UNK understood STOP
START underlying these UNK of mimesis are certain UNK concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some UNK before the main argument can proceed STOP
START experience is not seen , as it is in classical UNK , as UNK us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space and UNK their character , movements , and changes on the UNK UNK of an UNK UNK STOP
START neither is primary experience understood according to the attitude of modern UNK in which nothing is thought to be received other than signals of UNK qualities producing their responses in the appropriate sense UNK STOP
START primary feelings of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects ( houses , trees , UNK , UNK nor a collection of isolated and neutral UNK qualities STOP
START in contrast to all this , primary data are data of a self involved in UNK processes and powers STOP
START the most primitive feelings are UNK value feelings , both positive and negative : a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into UNK ; ; STOP
START a desire to avoid and UNK this or that other part STOP
START these desires UNK a sense of UNK UNK powers in which one is involved , some working for one's good , others threatening ill STOP
START gone is the UNK UNK of the mind STOP
START in its place is a UNK consciousness UNK and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one's life are determined by UNK of process in which one is caught STOP
START the principal UNK of this view of primary experience as `` UNK UNK '' is alfred north UNK STOP
START our most UNK and UNK impressions , he says , are those of being involved in a large UNK of powers which have a longer past than our own , which are UNK in a vast movement through the present toward the future STOP
START we feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree UNK or threatening STOP
START later UNK and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment in these UNK of value , but the UNK themselves are the primary UNK of experience STOP
START it takes a great deal of abstraction to free UNK from the primitive impression of larger UNK of power and influence and to view one's world simply as a collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern , UNK of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far as they present themselves for inspection STOP
START UNK is here UNK david UNK understanding of the nature of experience ; ; STOP
START he is UNK , also , every UNK which stems from UNK UNK that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from UNK UNK , and that UNK UNK is something UNK UNK to the world , not directly UNK STOP
START what UNK calls `` UNK '' is what UNK calls `` perception in the mode of UNK UNK '' which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception in the mode of UNK UNK STOP
START as long as perception is seen as composed only of isolated sense data , most of the quality and UNK of existence UNK its UNK , becomes an invention of consciousness , and the result is a philosophical UNK STOP
START UNK UNK that the human way of understanding existence as a unity of UNK and UNK processes which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because the basic form of such an understanding , for all its UNK and tendency to mistake the detail , is initially given in the way man feels the world STOP
START in this respect experience is broader and full of a UNK variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct STOP
START a chief characteristic of experience in the mode of UNK UNK is one of UNK from the past STOP
START both i and my feelings come up out of a chain of events that UNK out into the past into sources that are ultimately very unlike the UNK which i now am STOP
START after only UNK years of UNK , there were already indications of UNK , though `` in a slight degree '' , to be sure STOP
START there were more indications by the UNK century STOP
START i leave it to the UNK to say what they were , but i noticed several a few years ago , during an automobile ride from UNK to UNK STOP
START in town after town my UNK pointed out the negro school and the white school , and in every instance the former made a better appearance ( it was newer , for one thing ) STOP
START it really looked as if a change of the sort UNK by UNK UNK had been going on STOP
START but with the UNK of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in UNK ) , the improvement was UNK STOP
START for over a hundred years southerners have felt that the north was UNK on them STOP
START it's UNK , this feeling that one is being picked on , continually , constantly STOP
START by what right of superior virtue , southerners ask , do the people of the north do this ? ? STOP
START the traditional strategy of the south has been to UNK the UNK of the north , to demonstrate that the north possessed no superior virtue , to `` show the world that '' as UNK UNK UNK said to his UNK ) `` however bad i may be , you're not quite the people to say it '' STOP
START in the UNK war years , the south argued that the slave was not less UNK treated than the factory worker of the north STOP
START at the present time , the UNK takes the line that there's no more of the true spirit of `` integration '' in the north than in the south STOP
START the line is a pretty good one STOP
START people talk about `` the law of the land '' STOP
START the expression has become quite a UNK STOP
START but people can't be made to UNK , UNK ( the two are UNK by southern standards ) by law STOP
START i was having lunch not long ago ( UNK to UNK ) with three distinguished historians ( one UNK in the european middle ages , one in american history , and one in the far east ) , and i asked them if they could name instances where the general UNK had been UNK changed with `` UNK speed , UNK UNK '' ( UNK UNK words for the UNK of UNK UNK ) by judicial UNK STOP
START they didn't seem to be able to think of any STOP
START a virginia judge a while back cited a roman UNK to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change STOP
START but i suspect that the old roman was referring to change made under military occupation -- the sort of change which UNK was talking about when he said , `` they make a desert , and call it peace '' ( `` UNK UNK , UNK UNK '' STOP
START ) STOP
START moreover , the law of the land is not UNK ; ; STOP
START it can be changed ; ; STOP
START it has been , many times STOP
START mrjustice UNK UNK UNK decision in UNK was UNK in the north , and soon became a dead letter STOP
START UNK was the law of the land , but it was UNK ( how many of us UNK took up drinking in UNK days , drinking was so gay , so UNK , especially in the sophisticated UNK ! ! STOP
START ) and was UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK its UNK virtue in the light of a little history STOP
START the declaration of independence says that `` governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed '' STOP
START the phrase `` consent of the governed '' needs a hard look STOP
START how do we define it '' ? ? STOP
START is the consent of the governed a numerical majority ? ? STOP
START UNK dealt with this question in his `` UNK on government '' STOP
START to guard against the UNK of a numerical majority , UNK developed his theory of `` UNK majority '' , which , he said , `` by giving to each portion of the community which may be UNK affected by the action of government , a negative on the others , UNK all UNK or local legislation '' STOP
START who will say that our country is even now a UNK community ? ? STOP
START that regional UNK do not still exist ? ? STOP
START that the court order does not UNK affect the southern region ? ? STOP
START who will deny that in a vast portion of the south the federal action is UNK with the UNK concept of `` the consent of the governed '' ? ? STOP
START circumstances UNK cases STOP
START a friend of mine in new mexico said the court order had caused no particular trouble out there , that all had gone as UNK as a marriage UNK STOP
START he seemed a little UNK that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere STOP
START i UNK something about a possible difference between new UNK history and UNK STOP
START one can meet with UNK almost anywhere : the UNK viewpoint , it doesn't affect us ! ! STOP
START southern liberals ( there are a good many ) -- especially if they're rich -- often exhibit UNK UNK STOP
START the trouble here is that it's almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything STOP
START you've already sent your daughter to miss UNK select academy for girls and your son to UNK select academy for boys , and you can be as liberal as you please with UNK UNK STOP
START if there's no suitable academy in your own neighborhood , there's always new england STOP
START new england UNK welcome UNK from the UNK , south as well as west STOP
START they may even UNK a colored student or two for show , though he usually turns out to be from UNK , or any place other than the american south STOP
START it would be interesting to know how much `` integration '' there is in the famous , UNK colleges and UNK schools of new england STOP
START a recent newspaper report said there were five negroes in the 1960 UNK class of nearly one thousand at yale ; ; STOP
START that is , about UNK of one per cent , which looks pretty `` UNK '' to me , especially in an institution which UNK to be `` national '' STOP
START i must UNK that i prefer the liberal who is personally affected , who is willing to send his own children to a mixed school as proof of his faith STOP
START i leave out of account the question of the best interests of the children , the question of what their best interests really are STOP
START i'm talking about the grand manner of the liberal -- north and south -- who is not affected personally STOP
START if these people were denied a voice ( do they have a moral right to a voice ? ? STOP
START ) , what UNK would be left ? ? STOP
START who is involved UNK UNK ? ? STOP
START well , after everybody has followed the new england pattern of UNK one's children into private schools , only the poor UNK are left STOP
START and it is precisely in this UNK economic class that one finds , and has always found , the most racial friction STOP
START a dear , UNK friend of mine , who like myself grew up in the south and has spent many years in new england , said to me not long ago : `` i can't UNK new england for UNK all UNK '' STOP
START being a teacher of american literature , i remembered UNK `` massachusetts to virginia '' , where he said : `` but that one dark UNK burden UNK must UNK with alone , and UNK the bitter UNK which UNK UNK have UNK '' STOP
START there is a legend ( UNK records it in his `` english UNK '' STOP
START and one finds it again in thomas UNK page ) to the effect that the UNK on its second voyage brought a UNK of negro slaves STOP
START whether historically a fact or not , the legend has a certain symbolic value STOP
START UNK is an UNK word STOP
START it is something which most of us try to get out from under STOP
START like the UNK in UNK UNK `` blue hotel '' , we run around UNK , `` well , i didn't do anything , did i '' ? ? STOP
START robert UNK UNK puts it this way in `` brother to UNK '' : `` the recognition of UNK is the beginning of innocence '' , where innocence , i think , means about the same thing as UNK STOP
START a man must be able to say , `` father , i have UNK '' , or there is no hope for him STOP
START lincoln understood this better than most when he said in his `` second UNK '' that god `` gives to both north and south this terrible war , as the UNK due to those by whom the UNK came '' STOP
START he also spoke of `` the wealth UNK by the UNK two hundred and fifty years in UNK UNK '' STOP
START lincoln was historian and UNK enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had UNK in the hands of the UNK of new UNK engaged in the slave trade STOP
START after how many UNK is such wealth ( UNK all the while through the UNK of high finance ) UNK of UNK ? ? STOP
START it is a question which new UNK long ago put out of their minds STOP

START new england , as everyone knows , has long been UNK to the nation STOP
START there one finds concentrated in a comparatively small area the chief universities , colleges , and UNK schools of the united states STOP
START why should this be so ? ? STOP
START it is true that new england , more than any other section , was dedicated to education from the start STOP
START but i think that something more than this is involved STOP
START how did it happen , for example , that the state university , that great symbol of american democracy , failed to UNK in new england as it did in other parts of the country ? ? STOP
START isn't it a bit odd that the three states of southern new england ( massachusetts , connecticut , and rhode island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been a & m colleges ? ? STOP
START was it supposed , UNK , that a & m ( vocational training , that is ) was quite sufficient for the UNK class which UNK that part of the new england world in the UNK war period , the UNK having been brought in from southern europe , to work in the mills , to make up for the labor UNK caused by UNK to the west ? ? STOP
START is it not UNK that UNK UNK state , rhode island , should have been the very last of the UNK to establish a state university ? ? STOP
START the state universities of UNK , new UNK , and vermont are older and more `` respectable '' ; ; STOP
START they had less UNK to UNK with STOP
START a yale historian , writing a few years ago in the yale review , said : `` we in new england have long since segregated our children '' STOP

START and what a UNK of those UNK that fair land ! ! STOP
START i don't UNK to go into their history , but i have one or two UNK STOP
START one is that they were established , or gained UNK , under pressure provided by these same UNK , from whom the old families wished to UNK their children STOP
START in the early days of a UNK population , the public school was quite satisfactory STOP
START among the UNK of the UNK prize for literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of english STOP
START of these there are surely few that would be more UNK UNK than UNK UNK UNK , the UNK poet and novelist who received the award in UNK and whose UNK was UNK two years ago STOP
START equally a master of prose and verse , he UNK the glory of UNK in the past and continues it into the present STOP
START in the following sketch we shall present a brief UNK of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself STOP
START UNK was born in UNK , of a UNK family STOP
START on his father's side he was of german UNK , on his mother's he came of the old UNK UNK STOP
START the family estate was situated near UNK on lake UNK in south central UNK STOP
START it is a UNK , rather UNK region , but full of UNK and historic associations STOP
START as a boy in a local school he was UNK and UNK , absorbed in his UNK for nature and his UNK of UNK ancient glory STOP
START he liked to UNK himself as a UNK and to dress for the part STOP
START being somewhat UNK in health , at the age of sixteen he was sent to southern europe , for which he at once developed a passion , so that he spent nearly all of the following ten years abroad , at first in italy , then in greece , egypt , asia minor , and UNK STOP
START in one of his UNK at home he married , to the great disapproval of his father , who UNK because of his extreme youth STOP
START UNK to become a painter , he entered the UNK of UNK in paris , where he enjoyed the life of the artists , but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction STOP
START he gives us an account of this in his UNK and humorous poem , `` the happy artists '' STOP
START `` i UNK the world through printed symbol UNK , and through the UNK UNK i UNK to see the inner man STOP
START i looked UNK with my cold mind and with my burning heart '' STOP
START in this final line , we have the key to his nature STOP
START few writers have better understood their UNK UNK STOP
START UNK could never be satisfied by surface STOP
START it may , however , be noted that his gift for color and UNK must have been greatly UNK by his stay in paris STOP
START the first result of UNK long UNK abroad was a volume of poems , UNK and UNK ( UNK UNK UNK ) , published in UNK STOP
START it was a brilliant UNK , so much so indeed that it aroused a new UNK in the younger poets , as did UNK UNK harold STOP
START professor UNK book , UNK UNK critic of the period , UNK it as follows : `` in this we have the verse of a painter ; ; STOP
START strongly colorful , plastic , UNK , vivid STOP
START in a UNK , sometimes UNK , form there is nothing academic ; ; STOP
START all is seen and felt and experienced , the observation is sharp and the imagination UNK STOP
START the young UNK UNK the french life of the streets ; ; STOP
START he tells stories of the thousand and one nights , and UNK up before us the UNK of UNK STOP
START in the UNK UNK of the east he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence , and for that reason he UNK it STOP
START and yet amid all the gay UNK in UNK and UNK is a cycle of short poems , `` thoughts in UNK '' , filled with UNK , UNK , and UNK UNK '' STOP
START of the longer pieces of the volume none is so UNK as `` UNK and UNK '' , which at once took rank among the UNK poems ever written in the UNK language STOP
START it UNK the unknown architect who designed the temple of UNK at UNK , next to the UNK the UNK example of UNK classic style now in existence STOP
START on the eve of his return to their native UNK he speaks with his wife of the UNK which rises before them in its completed UNK STOP
START the supreme object of their lives is now UNK , says the wife , her husband has achieved immortality STOP
START not so , he answers , it is not the architect but the temple that is UNK STOP
START `` the man's true reputation is his work '' STOP
START the short poems UNK at the end of the volume as `` thoughts in UNK '' is , as professor book indicated , in sharp contrast with the others STOP
START it consists of UNK personal UNK , such as `` the UNK '' : `` there is a UNK UNK deep within my soul STOP
START to get it out into the UNK UNK is my UNK aim both first and last , the whole STOP
START it UNK away , it UNK and UNK me STOP

START a dominant motive is the UNK UNK for his UNK and its UNK associations : `` not UNK , but the fields where i would UNK , the UNK where as a child i used to play '' STOP
START he is utterly UNK in himself and in the UNK life he has been leading STOP
START what he really wants is to find `` a sacred cause '' to which he can UNK UNK himself STOP
START this UNK individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all the rest of his life in UNK STOP
START his cause was to UNK the glory of her past and to UNK her people to UNK it in the present STOP
START he did not , however , find himself at once STOP
START his next major work , completed in UNK , was a long fantastic epic in prose , entitled UNK UNK , which professor book describes as a monument on the grave of his UNK and UNK youth STOP
START the hero , who is himself , is represented as a UNK in the UNK lands of the east , a sort of UNK type , who , to quote from professor book again , `` even in the pleasure gardens of UNK can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life STOP
START he is driven back by his UNK to the UNK UNK of his fathers in the forest of UNK '' STOP
START from this time on UNK proceeded to find his deeper self STOP
START by the death of his father in UNK he had come into possession of the family estate and had UNK its traditions STOP
START he did not , however , settle back into UNK with things as they were STOP
START like his friend and contemporary august UNK he had little patience with collective UNK STOP
START he saw UNK as a country of UNK and narrow UNK , UNK to the heroic spirit of its former glory STOP
START UNK remedy for this condition was to UNK down the old structures and build UNK from the ground up STOP
START UNK conception , on the contrary , was to UNK the present by the UNK of the past STOP
START whether in prose or poetry , all of UNK later work was concerned with UNK STOP
START with the first of a group of historical novels , the charles men ( UNK ) , published in UNK , he achieved the UNK of his career STOP
START in scope and power it can only be compared to UNK war and peace STOP
START about one-third as long , it is less UNK and detailed , but better coordinated , more UNK and more dramatic STOP
START though it centers around the brilliant and UNK figure of charles 12 , , the true hero is not finally the king himself STOP
START hence the title of the book , referring to the soldiers and subjects of the king ; ; STOP
START on the fatal UNK of UNK , to quote from the novel , `` the UNK he UNK for himself UNK down upon his people '' STOP
START the charles men consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories , each UNK a special phase of the general subject STOP
START somewhat UNK in interest for an average reader , eight or ten of these are among the UNK of their kind in literature STOP
START they UNK a great variety of scene and interest : UNK UNK of war , UNK UNK , UNK UNK of UNK events , and UNK humorous sketches of odd characters STOP
START the general effect is tragic STOP
START almost nothing is said of UNK spectacular UNK , the central theme being the heroic loyalty of the UNK people to their UNK king in UNK and defeat STOP
START to carry out this UNK conception the author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale STOP
START his peculiar gift , as had been suggested before , is his intensity STOP
START george UNK has said that UNK is the core of style STOP
START of few authors is this more true than of UNK STOP
START the charles men has a tremendous range of characters , of common folk even more than of major figures STOP
START the career of charles 12 , is obviously very similar to that of UNK STOP
START his ideal was alexander of UNK , as UNK was UNK UNK STOP
START his purpose , however , was not to establish an empire , but to assert the principle of divine justice STOP
START each UNK to be a god in human form , but with each it was a different kind of god STOP
START each failed UNK in an UNK of russia and each brought UNK on the country that UNK him STOP
START each is still UNK as a national hero STOP
START the first half of the charles men , ending on the climax of the battle of UNK in UNK , is more UNK UNK than the second STOP
START after the UNK of that desperate and UNK campaign the character of the king UNK for a time into a UNK that was not merely UNK but often UNK STOP
START like UNK , he was the worst of UNK STOP
START there are , however , some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part , concerning the reactions of the UNK in UNK STOP
START then more than ever before did they show their UNK and patient UNK STOP
START this comes out in `` when the UNK ring '' , which describes the UNK of the UNK in southern UNK to UNK an UNK by the UNK STOP
START in `` the UNK ride '' , charles UNK out of a long period of UNK and UNK , UNK his old self , UNK from UNK , and finally reaches his own land after an absence of UNK years STOP
START he finds it in UNK misery and UNK STOP
START all his people ask for is no more war STOP
START but he UNK into yet another , this time with UNK , and is killed in an assault on the UNK of UNK , being only UNK years of age when he died STOP
START he had become king at fifteen STOP
START then suddenly there was a tremendous UNK of popular feeling STOP
START from being a UNK UNK and UNK he was now the symbol of all that was UNK and best in the history of UNK STOP
START this is brought out in the next to last chapter of the book , `` a UNK UNK '' , written in the form of an UNK prose poem STOP
START slowly the UNK of UNK and UNK passes through the snow beside the black water and into the UNK UNK UNK , the UNK of so many precious UNK STOP
START the guns are fired , the UNK are UNK , and the body of charles is carried down to the UNK and laid beside the UNK of his UNK STOP
START as he had UNK to be , he became the UNK of a UNK STOP
START UNK wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures UNK in UNK memory STOP
START excellent in their way , they lack the wide appeal of the charles men , and need not UNK us here STOP
START it is different with his volume the UNK and their UNK ( UNK UNK UNK UNK ) , a history intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high school students STOP
START UNK written , it is a perfect introduction to UNK history for readers of other countries STOP
START some of the earlier UNK have UNK of the supernatural , as suited to the UNK background STOP
START these are UNK of UNK UNK STOP
START especially UNK is the chapter , `` the little sister '' , about a UNK daughter who became a UNK in the UNK of UNK STOP
START the record UNK with UNK and UNK STOP
START UNK UNK is a UNK example , and charles 10 , , the UNK of UNK , hardly less so STOP
START of UNK UNK and charles 12 , it is UNK to speak STOP
START today the private detective will also UNK insurance claims or handle divorce cases , but his primary function remains what it has always been , to assist those who have money in their UNK struggle with those who have not STOP
START it is from this UNK background that the fictional private detective was UNK STOP
START the mythological private eye UNK from his UNK in real life in two essential ways STOP
START on the one hand , he does not work for a large agency , but is almost always UNK STOP
START as a UNK UNK , the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his UNK STOP
START for this reason , he appears as an independent and UNK figure , whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine STOP
START on the other hand , the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases ; ; STOP
START no UNK would ever think of asking him to do such things STOP
START whatever his original assignment , the fictional private eye ends up by UNK and UNK a crime , usually a murder STOP
START operating as a one man police force in fact if not in name , he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves STOP
START he UNK UNK not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a UNK at all ) , but because he UNK his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be UNK STOP
START thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple UNK STOP
START he is , first and UNK , a UNK of public UNK , a servant of society STOP
START it is this curious UNK of rugged individualism and public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological detective STOP
START by virtue of his UNK , his individualism and his freedom from external UNK , the private eye is a perfect UNK of the middle class conception of liberty , which amounts to doing what you please and let the devil take the UNK STOP
START at the same time , because the personal code of the detective UNK with the legal UNK of his society , because he likes to catch UNK , he is in middle class eyes a UNK man STOP
START in this way , the private detective gets the best of two possible UNK STOP
START he is an UNK but not an UNK ; ; STOP
START he is a public servant but not a UNK STOP
START in short , the fictional private eye is a specialized version of adam UNK ideal UNK , the man whose private ambitions must always and everywhere promote the public welfare STOP
START in the mystery story , as in the wealth of nations , individualism and the social good are two sides of the same UNK UNK STOP
START there is only one catch to this UNK arrangement : adam smith was wrong STOP
START not only did the ideal UNK not produce the greatest good for the greatest number , he ended by destroying himself , by giving birth to UNK UNK STOP
START the rise of the UNK corporations in western europe and the united states dates from the period UNK STOP
START now , although the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far as UNK , dickens , and UNK , it was not until the UNK decades of the UNK century that the private detective became an established figure in popular fiction STOP
START UNK holmes , the UNK of all private eyes , was born during the UNK STOP
START thus the transformation of adam UNK ideal UNK into a mythological detective UNK closely with the decline of the real UNK in economic life STOP
START driven from the UNK by the course of history , our hero UNK himself as a private detective STOP
START the birth of the myth UNK for the death of the ideal STOP
START even on the fictional level , however , the UNK which give rise to the mystery story are not fully resolved STOP
START the individualism and public service of the private detective both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct : he UNK the law without being told to do so STOP
START the private eye is therefore a moral man ; ; STOP
START but his morality rests upon that of his society STOP
START the basic UNK of all mystery stories is that the distinction between good and bad UNK with the distinction between legal and UNK STOP
START unfortunately , this assumption does not always hold good STOP
START as UNK in the UNK century has become increasingly dependent upon force and violence for its survival , the private detective is placed in a serious dilemma STOP
START if he is good , he may not be legal ; ; STOP
START if he is legal , he may not be good STOP
START it is the gradual UNK and UNK of this UNK which UNK the inner UNK of the evolution of the mystery story STOP
START with the UNK of sir arthur UNK UNK UNK holmes , the development of the modern private detective begins STOP
START UNK holmes is not merely an UNK ; ; STOP
START he is very close to being a mental case STOP
START a brief list of the great UNK little UNK would provide UNK with ample food for thought STOP
START holmes is UNK to the use of UNK and other UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START he is UNK to UNK UNK induced by the playing of the UNK ; ; STOP
START he is a UNK , an incredible UNK , a UNK UNK STOP
START holmes UNK against the social UNK of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds STOP
START his UNK begins as a defense against UNK STOP
START it was in order to avoid the UNK routine of middle class life that holmes became a detective in the first place STOP
START as he UNK watson , `` my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the UNK of existence STOP
START these little problems help me to do so '' STOP
START holmes is a public servant , to be sure ; ; STOP
START but the society which he serves UNK him to tears STOP
START the curious relationship between holmes and UNK yard provides an important UNK to the deeper significance of his UNK behavior STOP
START although he is perfectly willing to UNK with UNK yard , holmes has nothing but UNK for the intelligence and UNK of the police STOP
START they for their part are convinced that holmes is too `` UNK '' and `` theoretical '' to make a good detective STOP
START why do the police find holmes `` UNK '' ? ? STOP
START on the face of it , it is because he UNK UNK techniques UNK to official police routine STOP
START another , more interesting explanation , is UNK at by watson when he UNK on several occasions that holmes would have made a magnificent criminal STOP
START the great detective UNK UNK STOP
START UNK insight is UNK by the mysterious UNK between holmes and his UNK , UNK STOP
START the two men UNK each other closely in their UNK , their UNK , their UNK STOP
START the first series of UNK holmes UNK ends with holmes and UNK UNK together on the edge of a UNK STOP
START they are UNK to have UNK to a common grave in this fatal UNK STOP
START linked to holmes even in death , UNK represents the UNK of the great detective , the image of what our hero might have become were he not a public servant STOP
START just as holmes the UNK stands behind holmes the detective , so holmes the potential criminal UNK behind both STOP
START in the modern english `` UNK '' , this UNK of UNK UNK in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared STOP
START UNK UNK and lord peter UNK ( the respective UNK of UNK UNK and UNK UNK ) have retained UNK UNK but not his UNK for life and UNK habits STOP
START UNK and his counterparts are perfectly respectable people ; ; STOP
START it is true that they are also extremely UNK STOP
START their dedication to the status UNK has been UNK at the expense of the UNK but dangerous individualism of a UNK holmes STOP
START the UNK real UNK were unable to take root in england ; ; STOP
START they fled from the UNK UNK and made their way across the UNK atlantic STOP
START in the american `` UNK '' detective story of the UNK and UNK , the spirit of the UNK genius from baker street lives on STOP
START like holmes , the american private eye UNK the social UNK of his time STOP
START but unlike holmes , he feels his society to be not merely UNK but also UNK STOP
START surrounded by crime and violence everywhere , the `` UNK '' private eye can UNK his UNK only through a life of UNK isolation STOP
START his alienation is far more UNK than UNK ; ; STOP
START he is not an UNK but rather an UNK STOP
START with UNK UNK UNK UNK , alienation is represented on a purely physical plane STOP
START UNK UNK to ever leave his own house , and UNK most of his time drinking beer and playing with UNK STOP
START more profound and more disturbing , however , is the moral isolation of UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP
START in a society where everything is for sale , UNK is the only man who cannot be bought STOP
START his tough UNK UNK him to a UNK and difficult existence STOP
START UNK , UNK and UNK , he UNK the UNK UNK through the UNK of high society and low UNK , always alone , always UNK STOP
START in the end , he gets his man , but no one seems to care ; ; STOP
START virtue is its own and only UNK STOP
START a similar tone of underlying UNK and despair UNK the UNK UNK of UNK UNK and UNK the most famous of all american mystery stories , UNK UNK the UNK UNK STOP
START sam UNK UNK forces with a band of UNK in search of a UNK UNK statue of a UNK ; ; STOP
START but when the bird is found at last , it turns out to be a UNK STOP
START now the detective must save his own skin by UNK on the girl he UNK , who is also the real UNK STOP
START for sam UNK , neither crime nor virtue UNK ; ; STOP
START moreover , it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two STOP
START because the private eye UNK to save society in spite of himself , he invariably finds himself in trouble with the police STOP
START the latter are either too UNK to catch the UNK or too UNK to care STOP
START in either case , they do not appreciate the private UNK UNK STOP
START UNK mason and hamilton UNK , UNK UNK and UNK UNK spend more time fighting each other than they do in looking for the criminal STOP
START frequently enough , the police are themselves in league with the UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK red UNK provides a classic example of this theme STOP
START but even when the police are honest , they do not trust the private eye STOP
START he is , like UNK UNK , too UNK to be reliable STOP
START finally , in the UNK UNK among others , the UNK between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion : sam UNK becomes the chief murder suspect STOP
START in order to UNK himself , he is compelled to find the real criminal , who happens to be his girl friend STOP
START what was only a vague suspicion in the case of UNK holmes now appears as a direct UNK : the private eye is in danger of turning into his opposite STOP
START it is the growing UNK between individualism and public service in the mystery story which UNK this fatal dilemma STOP
START by UNK his own personal code of behavior , the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society whose fabric is UNK with crime and UNK STOP
START that society UNK by UNK the private eye as a threat to the status UNK , a potential criminal STOP
START if the detective UNK upon UNK his personal standards , he must now do so in conscious UNK of his society STOP
START he must , in short , cease to be a detective and become a UNK STOP
START on the other hand , if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession , he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism STOP
START UNK UNK resolved this UNK by UNK to write mystery stories and turning to other UNK STOP
START his UNK have adopted the opposite alternative STOP
START in order to save the mystery story , they have converted the private detective into an organization man STOP
START the first of two possible variations on this theme is UNK by UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP
START at first glance , this hero seems to be more rather than less of an UNK than any of his UNK STOP
START for UNK , nothing is UNK STOP
START he UNK when he UNK , takes his women where he finds them and always acts as judge , jury and UNK UNK into one STOP
START it will be shown that the objectives of the cooperative people in an organization determine the type of network required , because the type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages UNK in table 1 STOP
START great stress is placed on the role that the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness of the network STOP
START by monitoring , we mean some system of control over the types of information sent from the various centers STOP
START as a word of caution , we should be aware that in actual practice no message is purely one of the four types , question , command , statement , or UNK STOP
START for example , suppose a man wearing a UNK watch , driving a 1959 UNK UNK , UNK to ask a man on the sidewalk , `` what time is it '' ? ? STOP
START this sentence would have most of the characteristics of a question , but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the UNK has UNK the fact that he has no faith in his own UNK or the one attached to his car STOP
START if the man on the sidewalk is UNK at this question , it has served as an UNK STOP
START also , since the man questioned feels a strong UNK to answer ( and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought UNK ) the question has assumed some UNK properties of a command STOP
START however , for UNK we will stick to the idea that information can be classified according to table 1 STOP
START on this basis , certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for UNK purposes STOP
START networks UNK some special types of organization STOP
START the cocktail party STOP
START presumably a cocktail party is expected to UNK the UNK desire to get together a number of people who are UNK UNK and thereby UNK for bringing the level of UNK up to UNK for future cooperative UNK STOP
START the party is usually in a room small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another STOP
START the information is furnished by each of the guests , is sent by oral UNK over the air waves , and is received by the ears STOP
START since the air is a UNK , the network of communication remains UNK regardless of the positions or UNK of the points ( the people ) in the net STOP
START as shown in figure 1 , there is a connection for communication between every pair of points STOP
START this , and other UNK , make the cocktail party the most complete and most UNK communication system ever UNK up STOP
START all four types of message listed in table 1 are permitted , although UNK and cocktail tradition require holding the commands to a minimum , while UNK having UNK UNK are more than UNK encouraged STOP
START the UNK of the UNK provide that , for n people , there are af lines of communication between the pairs , which can become a large number ( UNK ) for a party of fifty guests STOP
START looking at the UNK , we see that af connection lines come in to each member STOP
START thus the cocktail party would appear to be the ideal system , but there is one weakness STOP
START in spite of the dreams of the host for UNK in the group , the af UNK messages for each guest UNK his receiving system beyond UNK if n UNK about six STOP
START the crowd consequently UNK up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six , with a UNK for the UNK ranging from three to twenty minutes STOP
START for the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else and the host wishes them to meet one or a few UNK UNK , then the `` open house '' system is UNK because the UNK guests are fixed UNK points and the UNK guests make and break UNK at the door STOP
START the rural community STOP
START we consider a rural community as an UNK of UNK UNK whose UNK is determined by the location and size of the UNK land sites necessary for family UNK STOP
START we assume for this illustration that the size of the land UNK is so great that the distance between UNK is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication is between nearest neighbors only , as shown in figure 2 STOP
START information beyond nearest UNK is carried UNK , UNK , and UNK as a UNK UNK STOP
START in figure 2 , the points in the network are designated by a letter accompanied by a number STOP
START the numbers indicate the number of nearest neighbors STOP
START it will be noted that point f has seven nearest neighbors , h and e have six , and p has only one , while the remaining points have intermediate numbers STOP
START in any social system in which communications have an importance comparable with that of production and other human factors , a point like f in figure 2 would ( other things being equal ) be the dwelling place for the community leader , while e and h would house the next most important citizens STOP
START a point like p gets information directly from n , but all information beyond n is indirectly UNK through n STOP
START the UNK at p is last to hear about a new cure , the UNK to UNK to his neighbors his UNK UNK , the one who goes the UNK to trade , and the one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or getting people to join him in a cooperative effort STOP
START since the UNK of poor communication are so great , p can be justified as a UNK site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made available by a UNK for milling purposes , a mine , or a sugar UNK camp STOP
START location UNK have given these matters much consideration STOP
START military organizations STOP
START the networks for military communications are one of the best examples of networks which not only must be changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the addition of new machines of war STOP
START they also furnish proof that , in modern war , message sending must be UNK STOP
START without monitoring , a military UNK becomes a UNK party STOP
START the need for monitoring became greater when radio was adopted for military UNK STOP
START alexander the great , who used UNK as message UNK , did not have to worry about having every officer in his command hear what he said and having hundreds of them comment at once STOP
START as time has passed and science has UNK , the speed of military vehicles has increased , the range of missiles has been extended , the use of UNK UNK on the UNK has been adopted , and the range and UNK of message sending has increased STOP
START next to the old problem of the UNK of decision making , network structure seems to be UNK , and without monitoring no network has value STOP
START on the parade ground the net may be similar to that shown in figure 3 STOP
START the monitoring is the highest and most UNK of any organization in existence STOP
START no questions , statements , or UNK are permitted -- only commands STOP
START commands go only from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank STOP
START the same command is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to UNK STOP
START all orders UNK with the officer of highest rank and UNK with action of the men in the UNK STOP
START even the officer in charge , be it a captain ( for small display ) or a general , is UNK by monitoring STOP
START this is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the UNK UNK up to where UNK has almost zero possibility STOP
START the commands are specified by the military regulations ; ; STOP
START are few in number , briefly UNK , all different in sound ; ; STOP
START and are UNK into UNK which permit any UNK UNK that could be desired on a parade ground STOP
START this monitoring is necessary because , on a parade ground , everyone can hear too much , and without monitoring a confused social event would develop STOP
START with troops UNK on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground , it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication STOP
START years ago this was true , but with the replacement of UNK or UNK by radio and radar ( and perhaps television ) , these restrictions have disappeared and now again too much is heard STOP
START in contrast to cocktail parties , military organizations , even in the field , are more formal STOP
START in the extreme and UNK example suggested in figure 3 , the organization is more easily understood and more UNK in behavior STOP
START a military organization has an objective chosen by the higher command STOP
START this objective is UNK to throughout the UNK of the action STOP
START the UNK system , or network , is UNK to meet the requirements of the objective , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory , a college , or a rural village STOP
START the assumptions upon which the example shown in figure 3 is based are : ( a ) one man can direct about six UNK if the UNK are chosen carefully so that they do not need too much personal UNK , UNK , etc STOP
START ( b ) a message runs too great a risk of being UNK if it is to be UNK more than about six UNK times STOP
START ( c ) decisions of a general kind are made by the central command STOP
START and ( d ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is UNK to the line of men on the lower rank STOP
START these assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the top , six directly under him , six under each of these , and so on until there are six levels of personnel STOP
START the number of people acting as one body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of UNK men STOP
START this UNK network would be of no UNK if there were no regulations UNK to the types of message sent STOP
START of types of message listed in table 1 , commands and statements are the only ones sent through the vertical network shown in figure 3 STOP
START a further regulation is that commands always go down , UNK by statements , and statements always go up , UNK by commands STOP
START questions and , particularly , UNK are usually UNK along UNK , UNK lines not indicated in figure 3 and seldom are carried beyond the nearest UNK STOP
START it will readily be seen that in this suggested network ( not UNK different from some of the networks in UNK today ) greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than is usually put into practice STOP
START furthermore , the network in figure 3 is only the basic net through which other networks UNK to UNK and the like are UNK STOP
START not discussed here are some military problems of modern times such as UNK warfare , where the UNK , sending , UNK , and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision making are not the UNK STOP
START such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain forest or UNK warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to UNK primitive UNK for what they could teach STOP
START a team for useful research STOP
START this is an UNK problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently UNK the comment that we have UNK specialists of the kind who can compete with the germans or UNK , for example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the UNK in UNK STOP
START we hear equally UNK concern over the belief that we have not enough UNK who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes STOP
START this problem of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of UNK and specialists can be investigated on a UNK network basis STOP
START since the difficulty of drawing the net is great , we will merely discuss it STOP
START first , we realize that a pure specialist does not exist STOP
START but , for practical purposes , we have people who can be considered as such STOP
START for example , there are persons who are in physical science , in the field of UNK , trained in UNK , who use only UNK , applying only the powder technique of x-ray UNK , to clay minerals only , and who have spent the last fifteen years UNK on the UNK ; ; STOP
START or persons in the social sciences in the field of UNK , studying the lung capacity of seven UNK indians STOP
START so we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more about less and less as he UNK , as UNK to the UNK , who knows less and less about more and more STOP
START american democratic thought , pointed up the relation between the protestant movement in this country and the development of a social religion , which he called the american democratic faith STOP
START those familiar with his work will remember that he placed the UNK of the democratic faith at around UNK STOP
START and he describes it as a balanced UNK between the notions of the free individual and what he called the fundamental law STOP
START i want to say more about UNK so-called fundamental law STOP
START but first i want to quote him on the relationship that he found between religion and politics in this country and what happened to it STOP
START he points out that from the time of jackson on through world war 1 , , UNK protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of america STOP
START he terms this early enthusiasm `` romantic christianity '' and UNK that its UNK to democratic beliefs of that day is so great that `` the doctrine of liberty seems but a secular version of its UNK in UNK protestantism '' STOP
START let me quote him even more fully , for his analysis is important to my theme STOP
START he says : `` beside the protestant philosophy of progress , as expressed in radical or conservative UNK , should be placed the doctrine of the democratic faith which UNK it to be the duty of the destiny of the united states to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping UNK the UNK of democracy '' STOP
START he UNK , `` in the middle period of the nineteenth century it was colored by christian UNK , in the twentieth century it was affected by UNK STOP
START but in every period it has been UNK '' STOP
START and let me add , UNK , also STOP
START some fourteen or fifteen years ago , in an essay i called the leader follows -- where ? ? STOP
START i used his UNK to illustrate what i thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call UNK STOP
START it seemed to me that the liberals had UNK the balanced UNK and UNK both liberty and the fundamental law in the common man STOP
START that is to say UNK fundamental law had been so much modified by this time that it was neither fundamental nor law any more STOP
START it is a weakness of UNK analysis that he never seems to realize that his so-called fundamental law had already been cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy STOP
START and with UNK the religion of humanity was UNK what UNK called christian UNK STOP
START and the common man was developing UNK power , or UNK , on his own STOP
START during the decade that followed , the common man , as that piece put it , grew UNK as the voice of god and fled from behind UNK UNK ( wilson ) only to learn from science , to his UNK relief that after all there was no god he had to speak for and that he was just an animal UNK -- that there was a chemical formula for him , and that too much couldn't be expected of him STOP
START the socialism UNK in the UNK of the roosevelt revolution , freedom from want and fear , seems a far cry from the individualism of the first UNK to the constitution , or of the UNK frontier STOP
START what had happened to the common man ? ? STOP
START french UNK had had only UNK influence in this country before the days of UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK of UNK after the war for southern independence and the general secular drift to the religion of humanity , however , prepared the way for a reception of the french UNK UNK UNK of one sort of another STOP
START the first of which to find important place in our federal government was the UNK income tax under wilson STOP
START moreover the UNK of our economy during the UNK , the UNK of the depression , the common UNK of UNK everywhere , all contributed in various ways to the UNK that replaced UNK UNK and the great UNK with the UNK UNK of the little people STOP
START however , it is important to trace the philosophy of the french revolution to its sources to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former STOP
START that john UNK philosophy of the social contract UNK the american revolution with its declaration of independence , i believe , we generally accept STOP
START yet , after UNK had given the social contract a new twist with his notion of the general will , the same philosophy , it may be said , became the idea source of the french revolution also STOP
START the importance of UNK twist has not always been clear to us , however STOP
START this notion of the general will gave rise to the UNK of paris in the revolution and later brought UNK to UNK STOP
START and it is clearly argued by lord UNK of UNK , in his remarkable long essay , the UNK of democracy , and in a more general way by UNK , in his new science of politics , that this same UNK idea , UNK through european democracy , is the source of UNK theory of the UNK of the UNK STOP
START this is important to understanding the position that UNK liberals found themselves in after world war 2 , and our great democratic victory that brought no peace STOP
START the long road that had taken liberals in this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , led UNK to the UNK dream of a UNK society under a socialist state STOP
START and the UNK existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate UNK STOP
START and by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in this country was UNK UNK STOP
START we will recall that the still UNK liberals of the UNK administration gathered with other western UNK in san francisco to set up the legal UNK , finally and at last , to UNK war -- to UNK want and fear -- out of the world : the united nations STOP
START we of the UNK world got all set for peace and rehabilitation STOP
START then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight , an UNK , an UNK , an UNK and UNK war with our strongest ( and some had thought UNK ) UNK STOP
START during the next five years the leaders of the fair deal UNK UNK down from the optimistic expectations of the new deal STOP
START during the next five years liberal leaders in the united states UNK in the cumulative confusion UNK upon and UNK in a negative policy of UNK -- and the UNK UNK -- enforced and UNK only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest UNK for but could not abandon : the atom UNK STOP
START in 1952 , it will be remembered , the UNK positive program UNK on the popular UNK with liberal leadership and won UNK STOP
START all of this , i know , is recent history familiar to you STOP
START but i have been at some UNK to review it as the drama of the common man , to point up what happened to him under UNK leadership STOP
START a UNK UNK , sam UNK , has UNK it in the title of one of his books as the UNK of the UNK STOP
START he UNK his UNK , however , with a review of the eisenhower UNK UNK at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents , all UNK to catch some UNK of the emerging new age STOP
START the show was colorful , indeed , UNK , but the press for all its UNK could UNK no note of a UNK UNK with destiny STOP
START UNK offers his book as an explanation of why there was no UNK STOP
START and i select this sentence as its pertinent UNK : `` in essence the drama of his ( UNK ) UNK can be described as the UNK of a nation turned conservative and struggling -- thus far with but limited and UNK success -- to give effective voice and force to that UNK '' STOP
START i will assume that we are all aware of the continuing struggle , with its limited and UNK success , toward UNK STOP
START it has moved on various levels , it has been UNK and confused STOP
START obviously there has been no agreement on what american UNK is , or rather , what it should be STOP
START for it was UNK , not to say UNK , when the struggle began STOP
START i saw a piece the other day UNK william UNK , author of man and god at yale and UNK of the national review , as no conservative at all , but an old liberal STOP
START i would agree with this view STOP
START but i'm not here to define UNK STOP
START what i am here to do is to report on the UNK of the struggle -- a struggle that amounts to UNK -- to see if we can UNK its future course STOP
START one of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of the last election , i suppose , is that we , the majority , were UNK with eisenhower UNK STOP
START though , to be sure , we gave kennedy no very positive approval in the UNK of his UNK STOP
START this is , however , UNK of our national UNK STOP
START but before i try to UNK it , i would offer other evidence STOP
START i will mention two volumes of specific comment on this UNK that appeared last year STOP
START the earlier of them was an UNK enterprise , sponsored by life magazine , under the title of the national purpose STOP
START the UNK to this testament were all well-known : a former democratic UNK for president , a new deal poet , the UNK chief editorial writer , two newspaper UNK , head of a national UNK company , a popular protestant UNK , etc STOP
START what i want to point out here is that all of them are UNK , or modified liberals , with perhaps one exception STOP
START i suppose we might UNK UNK UNK as an old liberal STOP
START and i would further note that they all -- with one exception again -- UNK in one key or another the same song STOP
START its UNK was : `` let us return to the UNK democracy of our UNK for our salvation '' STOP
START UNK UNK expressed some UNK about this return STOP
START others UNK technology and common sense STOP
START only walter UNK UNK the possibility of our having `` UNK most of what we used to regard as the program of our national purposes '' STOP
START but the most notable thing about the UNK of these UNK was that the UNK UNK of socialism was UNK absent STOP
START the second specific comment was the report of UNK commission on national goals , UNK goals for americans STOP
START they , perhaps , gave the pitch of their position in the UNK where it was said that eisenhower UNK that the commission be UNK by the american assembly of columbia university , because it was UNK STOP
START the commission seems to represent the viewpoint of what i would call the unconscious liberal , but not unconscious enough , to UNK the now UNK UNK of socialism STOP
START and here again we hear the same UNK mentioned above : `` the UNK goal of the united states set long ago was to guard the rights of the individual , UNK his development , UNK his opportunity '' STOP
START this group is UNK and their program tends to be technological STOP
START but it is the need to UNK these UNK that i would UNK here as UNK of the common man's UNK STOP
START and let me add UNK new book as another UNK of it , particularly so in view of the attention time magazine gave it when it came out recently STOP
START father UNK goes back to the declaration of independence , too , though i may add , with considerably more historical perception STOP
START i will reserve discussion of it for a moment , however , to return to president kennedy STOP
START as UNK of the common man's UNK , he is most significant : a liberal and a catholic , elected by the skin of his teeth STOP
START does that not suggest to you an UNK and uneasy , not to say confused , state of the public mind ? ? STOP
START what is the common man's UNK ? ? STOP
START UNK take a UNK look back over the course we have come STOP
START has not that way been UNK always by the UNK of liberalism up until the turning back under eisenhower ? ? STOP
START and the basic character of that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic STOP
START ralph UNK gave it the name of protestant philosophy of progress STOP
START but there's a subjective side to that utopian outlook STOP
START does our society have a UNK , UNK growth of technology which may end our civilization , or a normal , healthy growth ? ? STOP
START here there may be an analogy with cancer : we can UNK UNK by their rapidly UNK growth , UNK only when related to the more normal rate of healthy growth STOP
START should the UNK growth of technology then UNK us ? ? STOP
START noting such evidence is the first step ; ; STOP
START and almost the only `` cure '' is early detection and removal STOP
START one way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology would be to check the strength of our UNK UNK to see if their UNK is as healthy as before STOP
START so an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly UNK situation STOP
START in any event , whether society may have cancer , or merely a UNK UNK , the `` disease '' , we shall find , is political , economical , social , and even medical STOP
START have not our physical abilities already UNK because of the more UNK lives we are now living ? ? STOP
START hence the prime issue , as i see it , is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature STOP
START we are already committed to establishing man's UNK over nature and everywhere on earth , not merely in the limited UNK context we are UNK of today STOP
START otherwise , we go on UNK trying to draw the line , color and other , as to which kind of man we wish to see UNK STOP
START we have proved so able to solve technological problems that to UNK we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely UNK , if nothing else STOP
START we must believe we have the ability to affect our own UNK : otherwise why try anything ? ? STOP
START so in these pages the term `` technology '' is used to include any and all means which could UNK , project , or UNK man's control over himself and over other men STOP
START naturally this includes all communication forms , UNK , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control STOP
START properly UNK of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world , we must UNK these resources without war or violent revolution STOP
START if we were creating a wholly new society , we could insist that our social , political , economic and UNK institutions UNK rather than UNK man ; ; STOP
START best growth STOP
START but we cannot start off with a clean UNK STOP
START so we must first UNK our present institutions with respect to the effect of each on man's major needs STOP
START asked which institution most needs UNK , i would say the corporation as it exists in america today STOP
START at first glance this appears strange : of all people , was not america founded by rugged UNK who established a new way of life still UNK `` UNK '' societies abroad ? ? STOP
START but hear UNK UNK , former moscow UNK of the new york times , and author of `` to moscow -- and beyond '' STOP
START in a book review of `` the soviet cultural UNK '' , he says , `` long before the state department organized its UNK into an UNK contacts staff in order to wage a cultural UNK within soviet UNK , the sharp UNK of american culture had UNK its mark across the russian UNK , as when the UNK UNK of ' UNK and UNK ' UNK the state department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy lines STOP
START they were not UNK or jazz musicians , or even UNK of UNK and UNK displays , but rugged UNK UNK like henry UNK , UNK UNK , thomas UNK , the international UNK UNK and david UNK STOP
START their kind created an american culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which UNK russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a UNK from the federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to UNK UNK or program a series of UNK of interested agencies STOP
START this favorable image of america in the minds of russian men and women is still there despite years of UNK UNK propaganda '' STOP
START corporations now UNK STOP
START STOP
START perhaps the UNK present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the `` rugged UNK UNK '' no more exists in america STOP
START in his UNK is a UNK version known as `` the corporation '' STOP
START but even if we cannot see the UNK characteristics in this new image of america , UNK can ; ; STOP
START and our loss of `` prestige '' abroad is the direct result STOP
START no amount of UNK will cover up the UNK facts STOP
START if we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it STOP
START first , let us realize that whatever good this UNK achieved in earlier times , now the corporation per UNK cannot take economic leadership STOP
START businesses must develop as a result of the ideas , energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind STOP
START when we `` forced '' individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal UNK , we adopted what i would term `` UNK '' and so took a major step toward socialism STOP
START the UNK loss , of course , was the individual's UNK desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy STOP
START socialism , i grant , has a definite place in our society STOP
START but let us not UNK of the UNK of UNK by referring to a form that is not truly UNK STOP
START some forms of UNK do indeed work -- UNK organizations , a credit to any society STOP
START but the UNK which UNK our whole economy as well as our politics and social life , will not stand close UNK STOP
START its UNK to operate in the public interest is little more than a UNK STOP
START it serves only its own stockholders and UNK at that STOP
START as a creative enterprise , its abilities are primarily in `` UNK '' creative enterprises developed outside its own organization ( an ability made possible by us , and almost UNK ) STOP
START as to benefits to employees , it is UNK for its UNK UNK except where it depends on them for services STOP
START the corporation in america is in reality our form of socialism , UNK in a sense with the other UNK form that has emerged within governmental UNK STOP
START but while the corporation has all the UNK of the socialist form of organization ( so UNK it cannot UNK do much of anything not compatible with its need to UNK itself and maintain its status UNK ) , UNK it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the UNK to operate for the benefit of society as a whole STOP
START so we are faced with a vast network of UNK UNK UNK themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard to the needs of society , controlling society and UNK upon it a UNK representing only the UNK needs for survival STOP
START the corporation has a limited , specific place in our society STOP
START UNK speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great UNK in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single UNK are secondary to the needs of society STOP
START examples are in public UNK , making military aircraft and UNK , or where the investment and risk for a UNK would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by any means other than the corporate form , UNK major UNK or UNK STOP
START thus , if corporations are not to run away with us , they must become UNK institutions , subject to public control and needs STOP
START in all other areas , private initiative of the `` UNK '' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services STOP
START UNK STOP
START UNK UNK technology can be done only by UNK a UNK society ; ; STOP
START and for this human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests STOP
START such genuine human leadership the UNK can offer , corporations cannot STOP
START it can project long-range goals for itself STOP
START corporations react UNK to UNK UNK , e.g, UNK and annual UNK reports STOP
START UNK can establish a unity and UNK of control ; ; STOP
START corporations , being more UNK , cannot STOP
START UNK can establish a meaningful identity , representing a human personality , and thus establish UNK relationships with customers and community STOP
START corporations are apt by nature to be UNK , UNK , UNK and almost exclusively UNK , a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public STOP
START the UNK is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board of directors and stockholders STOP
START leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop STOP
START men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied , complicated and trying type so that at UNK they have developed the competence and UNK to accept the personal responsibility so UNK needed now STOP
START hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest STOP
START UNK should get the tax advantages now UNK to corporations , UNK chance to UNK capital so vital for growth STOP
START corporations should pay added taxes , to be used for educational purposes ( not necessarily of the formal type ) STOP
START the right to leave UNK should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated STOP
START to UNK wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation UNK those with real initiative from coming to the UNK , and is basically UNK STOP
START when the UNK UNK , the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired by another UNK or the government UNK to drop it STOP
START strikes should be declared UNK against corporations because UNK would have to be settled by government representatives acting as UNK of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be defined against UNK because employees and UNK must be completely UNK , as they are each a part of the whole STOP
START strikes threatening the security of the UNK , if UNK UNK , prevent a healthy relationship STOP
START certainly external forces should not be applied UNK out of mere power available to do so STOP
START if we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system , how can we expect to UNK it UNK ? ? STOP
START one kind of UNK STOP
START these proposals would go far toward creating the economic atmosphere UNK growth of the individual , who , in turn , would help us to cope with UNK technology STOP
START individual human strength is needed to UNK against an UNK condition STOP
START the battle is not easy STOP
START we are UNK to UNK others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of UNK needed , UNK , competent leaders STOP
START persons developed in today's corporations cannot hope to serve here -- a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside STOP
START in my own company , in effect a partnership , although UNK a corporation , i have been able to do many things for my employees which `` normal '' corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do STOP
START also , i am convinced that if my company were a UNK UNK instead of a partnership , i would have been even UNK to solve long-range problems for myself and my UNK STOP
START any abilities i may have were achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing in the growth and control of my business , coupled with raising my family STOP
START this combined experience , on a foundation of very average , i assure you , intelligence and background , has helped me do things many UNK people would UNK heavily against STOP
START perhaps a list of some of the `` practices '' of my company will help here STOP
START the company grew out of efforts by two completely UNK men in their late UNK , neither having a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of articles STOP
START from an initial investment of UNK in 1943 , it has grown , with no additional capital investment , to a present value estimated by some as UNK UNK ( we don't UNK financial figures to the public ) STOP
START its growth continues steadily on a UNK with past growth ; ; STOP
START and no UNK is in evidence STOP
START our UNK UNK and UNK nuts achieved UNK in just a few years time , despite substantial , well established competition STOP
START during the last years of UNK UNK administration , a red UNK developed in our country STOP
START many americans UNK UNK to the challenge of russia and turned to the UNK of ideas by force STOP
START UNK general UNK set about to protect the american people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the UNK STOP
START attorney general UNK made a series of UNK that sent more than UNK so-called UNK to the UNK , in direct violation of their constitutional rights STOP
START then , not many years later , the UNK activities committee , under the leadership of UNK UNK , UNK hundreds of UNK , UNK citizens STOP
START anyone who tried to remedy some of the most UNK defects in our form of democracy was UNK as a UNK red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government STOP
START this UNK reached its height under the leadership of senator joseph UNK STOP
START UNK of this sort found communist UNK UNK behind any new idea that would run UNK to UNK notions STOP
START new ideas were dangerous and must be UNK , no matter how STOP
START those who would UNK dangerous thoughts , credit ideas with high UNK STOP
START they give UNK interpretation to william UNK statement that `` every idea that enters the mind tends to express itself '' STOP
START they seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new STOP
START hence , the only UNK procedure is to UNK any and every notion , unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe STOP
START despite this danger , however , we are informed on every hand that ideas , not machines , are our UNK tools ; ; STOP
START they are UNK even though they cannot be recorded on a UNK page ; ; STOP
START they are the most valuable of commodities -- and the most UNK , for their demand far UNK supply STOP
START so UNK are ideas , we are told , that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall into two classes : those who UNK new ideas of their own , and those who UNK , UNK , or UNK from others STOP
START seemingly , with an UNK flow of ideas , all will be well , and we are even assured that `` an idea a day will keep the UNK away '' STOP
START that , however , may also bring the police , if the thinking does not meet with social approval STOP
START UNK , as well as model citizens , exercise their minds STOP
START merely having a mental image of some sort is not the UNK consideration STOP
START of course , there must be clarity : a single distinct impression is more valuable than many UNK ones STOP
START but clarity is not enough STOP
START the writer took a class of college students to the state hospital for the UNK ill in UNK , missouri STOP
START an UNK , a former university professor , UNK to us , UNK and clearly , that someone was UNK his thoughts STOP
START he UNK to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities that justice might be done STOP
START despite the clarity of his presentation , his idea was not of UNK UNK STOP
START true , ideas are important , perhaps UNK most precious UNK STOP
START but have we not gone UNK in UNK their significance ? ? STOP
START have we not actually developed idea worship ? ? STOP
START ideas we must have , and we seek them everywhere STOP
START we UNK literature for them ; ; STOP
START here we find stored the wisdom of great minds STOP
START but are all these works worthy of consideration ? ? STOP
START can they stand rigid UNK ? ? STOP
START UNK UNK and wisdom , his profound insight into human nature , have stood the test of centuries STOP
START but was he UNK in all things ? ? STOP
START what of his treatment of the jew in the merchant of UNK ? ? STOP
START shakespeare gives us a vivid picture of UNK , but probably he never saw a jew , unless in some of his UNK STOP
START the jews had been UNK from england in UNK and were not permitted to return before UNK , when shakespeare had been dead for UNK years STOP
START if any had UNK UNK by UNK , they certainly would not frequent the UNK STOP
START shakespeare did not usually UNK the UNK in his plays , but UNK them from old stories , UNK , and plays , UNK them together , and then UNK into them his UNK of life STOP
START rather than from a UNK study of jewish people , his UNK of UNK stems from a collection of italian stories , UNK UNK , published in UNK , although written almost two centuries earlier STOP
START he could learn at second hand from books , but could not thus capture the real jewish spirit STOP
START UNK UNK , in UNK the dust from shakespeare ( UNK ) , writes : `` there is not a word spoken by UNK which one would expect from a real jew '' STOP
START he took the story of the pound of flesh and had to UNK it on someone STOP
START the jew was the UNK victim STOP
START no jew was on hand to UNK his UNK struggling theater STOP
START it would have been UNK policy , for instance , to apply the UNK UNK to the UNK UNK STOP
START just as now anyone may UNK UNK at a citizen of UNK , or even of UNK , and no UNK investigation will result STOP
START who UNK about them ! ! STOP
START shakespeare does not tell us that UNK was an UNK individual STOP
START he sets him forth as being typical of the group STOP
START he tells of his `` jewish heart '' -- not a UNK heart ; ; STOP
START but a jewish heart STOP
START this would make anyone UNK and UNK , capable of UNK UNK STOP
START there is no justification for such UNK STOP
START if living jews were UNK for study , the bible was at hand STOP
START reading the old testament would have shown the UNK that the ideas attributed to UNK were UNK to the jews STOP
START are we better off for having UNK idea of UNK ? ? STOP
START studying the merchant of UNK in high school and college has given many young people their notions about jews STOP
START does this help the UNK to understand this group ? ? STOP
START thomas de UNK , UNK of the spanish UNK , put many persons to death STOP
START his name became UNK with UNK UNK STOP
START would we gain by keeping alive his memory and UNK today's roman catholics by saying he had a catholic heart ? ? STOP
START let his bones and his memory rest in the UNK century where they belong ; ; STOP
START he is out of place in our times STOP
START UNK UNK , too , is of UNK value in the modern world STOP
START ideas , in and of themselves , are not necessarily the greatest good STOP
START a successful UNK recently UNK his address to a UNK group with the statement that all UNK should be sent to the UNK for the UNK UNK where they and their theories might UNK together STOP
START will his words come to be UNK and quoted through the years ? ? STOP
START frequently we are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be UNK and UNK and in the end only the good ones will survive STOP
START but is that not like going to a chemistry laboratory and UNK UNK out UNK and UNK from an UNK of UNK and then , after UNK , UNK a new wonder drug inevitably to result ? ? STOP
START what of the efficiency of this natural instrument of free discussion ? ? STOP
START is there some magic in it that UNK results ? ? STOP
START when peter UNK ( pride of UNK , UNK ) informed us in UNK that we had an UNK UNK for the japanese , did the heated UNK of the UNK settle the truth or UNK of the proposition ? ? STOP
START the UNK spots came from the UNK of thomas UNK in UNK , and in this he announced an `` UNK '' law STOP
START if a child had a single drop of negro blood , he would UNK to the UNK line which , except as slaves under a superior race , had not made one step of progress in UNK years STOP
START that doctrine has been accepted by many , but has it produced good results ? ? STOP
START in the same vein , a certain UNK plot has been UNK STOP
START the son and UNK of a prominent family UNK a girl who has UNK UNK on the UNK of her finger UNK STOP
START in time she presents her UNK husband with a UNK child STOP
START is the world better for having this idea UNK upon it ? ? STOP
START will argument and debate decide its truth or UNK ? ? STOP
START for answers to such questions we must turn to the UNK , the UNK , the historians , the psychologists , and the UNK STOP
START long ago they UNK the notions of UNK and UNK to the UNK UNK STOP
START false ideas UNK another sector of our life STOP
START for several UNK much fiction has appeared dealing with the UNK STOP
START the UNK , almost without exception , has been presented as a UNK UNK STOP
START children , conditioned by this UNK notion , have UNK UNK , while adults , by their UNK attitudes , have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one STOP
START debate is not likely to UNK the tensions and make the lot of the UNK a UNK one STOP
START research , on the other hand , has shown many UNK to be UNK successful , some far better than the real mothers STOP
START UNK UNK informed us ( the psychology of women , UNK , , UNK ) that in all cultures `` the term ' UNK ' automatically UNK UNK implications '' , a conclusion accepted by many STOP
START will mere debate on that proposition , even though it be free and UNK , remove the UNK and leave a UNK of UNK gold ? ? STOP
START that is UNK , to say the least STOP
START research into several cultures has UNK her position to be a UNK one STOP
START most UNK ideas are UNK STOP
START but ideas , just for the sake of having them , are not enough STOP
START in the UNK , UNK for the depression literally UNK washington STOP
START for a time the president received hundreds of them every day , most of them UNK STOP
START ideas need to be tested , and not merely by argument and debate STOP
START when some question UNK in the medical field concerning cancer , for instance , we do not turn to free and open discussion as in a political campaign STOP
START we have UNK to the UNK specialist in the laboratory STOP
START the UNK of the UNK UNK UNK were not established on the UNK platform or in newspaper UNK , but in the laboratory and by tests in the field on thousands of children STOP
START our presidential campaigns provide much debate and argument STOP
START but is the result new UNK of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with confidence solve our domestic and international problems ? ? STOP
START man , we are told , is UNK with reason and is capable of UNK good from bad STOP
START but what a UNK task it is to UNK anything of value from the UNK UNK used so freely , particularly since such common use is made of UNK and UNK , in themselves UNK of intellectual UNK STOP
START we are reminded , however , that freedom of thought and discussion , the UNK exchange of ideas , is basic under our form of government STOP
START UNK in our political campaigns there is freedom to think , to examine any and all issues , and to speak without UNK STOP
START no holds are UNK STOP
START but have the results been UNK ? ? STOP
START may we state with confidence that in such an UNK a republic will find its greatest security ? ? STOP
START we must not forget , to be sure , that free discussion and debate have produced UNK results STOP
START in truth , we can say that this broke the power of senator joseph UNK , who was finally exposed in full light to the american people STOP
START if he had been `` UNK '' in some way , he would have become a UNK , a UNK point for people who shared his ideas STOP
START debate in the political UNK can be productive of good STOP
START but it is a UNK and UNK process : it can produce negative results but not much that is positive STOP
START debate UNK us of UNK but did not give us much that is positive STOP
START it did something to clear the ground , but it erected no striking new structure ; ; STOP
START it did not even provide the UNK plan for anything new STOP
START in the field of the natural sciences , UNK UNK data are quite readily available and any discussion can be UNK with good results STOP
START in the field of the social sciences a considerable fund of tested knowledge has been UNK that can be used to good advantage STOP
START by no means would we UNK the production of ideas : they provide raw materials with which to work ; ; STOP
START they provide UNK that lead to further production STOP
START we would establish no UNK STOP
START the UNK personality would have opened that office to him STOP
START and for the first time a representative of the highest office in the land would have been UNK to the charge that he had attempted to make it a UNK by UNK STOP
START it is testimony to the deep respect in which UNK was held by members of all parties that the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were not UNK to be UNK STOP
START these began to be apparent in a press conference held during the second UNK in order that the UNK specialists might clarify the UNK condition for the nation STOP
START and if UNK UNK felt UNK thereafter to UNK the ethics of the medical profession , his article in the atlantic monthly accomplished a good deal more STOP
START it forced us to UNK the responsibility for the position in which all medical UNK had been placed STOP
START the discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded us that in the historical perspective the UNK decision will finally clarify itself as a moral , rather than a medical , problem STOP
START because the responsibility for UNK the issue lay with the president , rather than with his doctors , nothing raises more surely for us the difficulties simple UNK faces in dealing with complex moral problems under political pressure STOP
START for the president had dealt with the matter UNK , in what he conceived as the democratic way STOP
START but the problem is one which gives us the measure of a man , rather than a group of men , whether a group of doctors , a group of party members assembled at a dinner to give their opinion , or the masses of the UNK STOP
START any attempt to UNK this statement of the central issue in the campaign of 1956 with the nature of the man who could not conceive it as the central issue will at least UNK our UNK about the UNK and UNK results of the UNK of both doctors and president in a situation which should never have UNK STOP
START it was a response to the conflict between political pressure and the moral intuition which resulted in attempts at UNK STOP
START in no other situation would a group of doctors , struggling UNK to improve the life UNK of a man beloved by the world , be subjected to such UNK and persistent UNK , and before they were prepared to demonstrate the kind of verbal precision which alone can clarify for mankind the problems it faces STOP
START and though we can look back now and see their errors , we can look back also to the ultimate error STOP
START it UNK in the press conferences : the UNK remarks about his running developed a singular tone , one which we find in few statements made by public individuals on such a matter STOP
START the press conference became a stage which UNK the drift of his private thinking , rather than his convictions STOP
START he UNK -- UNK , a UNK told us -- that it was `` not too important for the individual how he ends up '' STOP
START he gave us a UNK to explain his admission that even at the worst period of his second UNK it never occurred to him there was any UNK question about his running : as in the battle of the UNK , he had no fears about the outcome until he read the american newspapers STOP
START yet the attitude that the fate of the UNK demands in such a situation is quite distinct from the simple courage that can proceed with UNK to be fought , regardless of the consequences STOP
START in this case others should not have had to raise the UNK and fears STOP
START the UNK demands an UNK awareness of the larger implications of the death of any UNK STOP
START it is of the UNK importance to the people of america and of the world how their governing president `` ends up '' during the four years of his term STOP
START only when that term is ended and he is a private citizen again can he be permitted the freedom and the courage to discount the UNK of his death STOP
START UNK enough , in this instance such personal UNK were a luxury STOP
START at the national and international level , then , what is the highest kind of morality for the private citizen represents an instance of political UNK STOP
START and we had the uneasy sense that the UNK between the moral and the political UNK amid the events which concern us STOP
START for the tone of the UNK which UNK UNK original UNK of his running had been UNK UNK STOP
START neither the UNK enthusiasm which UNK a people's UNK sense of the UNK of things at UNK moments nor the vital UNK UNK its sense that something significant has UNK was in evidence STOP
START nothing UNK more clearly to that UNK than the peculiar editorial page UNK in a july issue of life magazine , the issue which also carried the second UNK of the UNK STOP
START the double editorial on two aspects of `` the UNK '' was UNK calculated to suggest a moral UNK for UNK great as well as small , UNK popular approval of this UNK attitude toward the highest office in the land STOP
START `` the moral UNK '' and `` the will to risk '' live UNK together , if we do not examine where the line is to be drawn STOP
START `` i may possibly be a greater risk than is the normal person of my age '' , the president had said on february UNK of the election year , UNK the fact that no one of his age had ever lived out another term STOP
START `` my doctors assure me that this increased percentage of risk is not great '' STOP
START but by the time the risk was UNK , events had UNK from his mind both increased UNK and a previously stated intention of considering carefully anything more serious than a UNK of UNK STOP
START only UNK did the situation color his thinking STOP
START UNK no president we have had would have UNK more than president eisenhower the possibility to which his own words , in the press conference held at the beginning of august , UNK : that unable as he was himself to say his running was best for the country , UNK he had placed his party before his nation STOP
START so it is that we UNK his opening statement in the first television address with the dramatic UNK of the present STOP
START no consideration of risk UNK itself upon him now : for this is what the mind does with the ideas on which it has not properly UNK STOP
START yet with a mind less UNK , if less sharp , than some of the UNK UNK which back him , he feels what he cannot UNK ; ; STOP
START and we watch him amid the UNK which suggest he could never in any conscience urge a risk upon the UNK STOP
START moving as he is into the phase of the campaign which demands conviction of him , he UNK a position that is UNK UNK STOP
START he UNK to the mercy of god the peace which this personal matter -- the assurance that he can physically UNK the burden of the office longer than any individual in the history of our nation has been able to do -- has brought him STOP
START what is simply an opinion formed in UNK of the laws of human probability , whether or not it is later UNK , has become by september of the election year `` a firm conviction '' STOP
START as a means of UNK a discussion which ought to have taken place , the statement is an effective one : we UNK with the universal confusion which gives rise to such convictions STOP
START but it is also the climax to one of the UNK chapters in our current political history STOP
START in UNK to god the responsibility which he learned could not rest with his doctors , eisenhower gave evidence of that UNK of the moral intuition which was to UNK his administration in the years to follow STOP
START in any other man this UNK to the UNK would have caused us a profound moral shock STOP
START about this man we had to think twice STOP
START we knew that it was , as UNK , the UNK fruit of a deeply moral nature STOP
START but the fact remains that even the unconscious acceptance of himself as a man of destiny UNK protected must be UNK in any man who UNK the responsibility for his major decisions , and thus for UNK his will on the people STOP
START and in the context of UNK personal UNK we have examined , there was occasional evidence of the origin of all such UNK STOP
START when the possibility that he had not given UNK to so UNK a decision seemed to UNK his UNK , UNK was known to make his characteristic statement to the press that he was not going to talk about the matter any more STOP
START thinking had stopped ; ; STOP
START it was not to be resumed STOP
START the portrait that had developed , UNK but consistently , was the portrait of a man to whom serious thinking is UNK enough that the making of a decision UNK , when it does not UNK , any ability to review the decision in the light of new evidence STOP
START this does not mean that the decision to run for office should inevitably have been UNK STOP
START instead it means that the thinking in which decision issues has the power to determine the morality of the decision , as in this instance the pressure for UNK practical or legislative attention to the constitutional problems the decision had UNK might have done STOP
START UNK through a third UNK , apparently without any provision for the handling of a major national emergency other than a talk with the UNK , eisenhower revealed the UNK UNK quality of his thinking STOP
START despite three UNK , no sense of moral UNK UNK him to distinguish his situation , and thus his responsibilities , from UNK STOP
START by contrast , the UNK reaction of the leader to the full demands his decision UNK upon him UNK the moral intuition and gives us the measure of the man STOP
START only by means of an intensive UNK with the detailed considerations following from any decision can he UNK attention to the practical details to be dealt with if the implications of UNK in the major decision are effectively to be checked STOP
START in the UNK struggle with UNK political fact he UNK to focus the essence of a problem in the significant detail , and to UNK the distinctions which clarify the detail as significant , with what is sometimes UNK UNK STOP
START like lincoln , he can distinguish his relation to god from the constitutional responsibilities a UNK decision UNK of him STOP
START like roosevelt , he can distinguish an attitude toward a russian leader he may share with a host of americans from the responsibilities diplomatic convention may UNK upon him STOP
START he UNK to UNK one to the other , sometimes UNK , accepting criticism for the lesser UNK facts breed STOP
START the very nature of a choice so UNK in distinction and fact leads to the valid convictions which become force of will in the UNK leader STOP
START the capacity for making the distinctions of which UNK is UNK , and the UNK with language which can UNK them into validity in the eyes of other men are the UNK means for UNK the moral intuition into moral leadership STOP
START the making of distinctions , like the perception of the great distinctions made , is an UNK difficult business STOP
START UNK slow progress towards the several UNK his achievement is even now UNK as such , and UNK interpreted as the UNK of UNK with vision STOP
START but because it is the function of the mind to turn the one into the other by means of the UNK with which words UNK it , we do not UNK examine the type of distinction , in the sphere of politics , on which decisions UNK STOP
START only recently , and perhaps because a television debate can so effectively UNK president UNK extraordinary UNK of detail , have the abilities on which the capacity for making distinctions depend begun to be clearly UNK at the level of politics STOP
START in his recent evaluation of UNK UNK for leadership , walter UNK has cited the `` precision '' of his mind , his `` UNK command '' of UNK detail , and his `` UNK for the crucial point '' as impressive in the extreme ; ; STOP
START and it is surely clear that the first of these is the result of the way in which the individual's command of language UNK with the other two STOP
START for this change is not a change from one positive position to another , but a change from order and truth to UNK and UNK STOP
START the UNK division , we might observe in passing , is not of itself directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle between ruling groups STOP
START rather it is UNK in a difference of response to the threat of social UNK STOP
START the division is not between those who wish to preserve what they have and those who want change STOP
START rather it is a division established by two absolutely different ways of thought with regard to man's life in society STOP
START these ways are absolutely UNK because they offer two different UNK for man's UNK from chaos STOP
START the UNK crisis , the third type of change raises the question `` what are we to do '' ? ? STOP
START on the most primitive level STOP
START for the answer cannot be derived from any UNK cohesive element in the UNK community STOP
START there is no UNK UNK answer to the question STOP
START for the truth formerly experienced by the community no longer has UNK status in the community , nor does any answer UNK by UNK or UNK STOP
START in this phase of change , no idea has social acceptance and so none has UNK status in the community STOP
START an UNK UNK in which not men but ideas compete for existence STOP
START if we examine the three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure we find an additional profound difference between the third and the first two , one that accounts for the notable difference between the responses they UNK STOP
START the first two types of change occur within the UNK and UNK structure of the society STOP
START the first involves a simple shift of interests in the society STOP
START the second involves something deeper , but its characteristic form UNK on a shift in policy for the community , not in the truth on which the community rests STOP
START thus in both types attention is UNK on the community itself , and its UNK life STOP
START the third type , however , UNK attention from the life of action and interests in the community and UNK it on the ground of being on which the community depends for its existence STOP
START UNK has analyzed this experience in the case of the stable , healthy community STOP
START there the community , faced with the need to UNK policy on the level of absolute justice , can find the answer to its problem in the absolute truth which it holds as partially experienced STOP
START this , however , cannot be done by a community whose very experience of truth is confused and UNK : it has no absolute standard , and consequently cannot distinguish the absolute from the UNK STOP
START it has lost its ground of being and UNK in a UNK of UNK STOP
START UNK and UNK are its characteristic diseases STOP
START precisely at the moment when it has lost its vision the mind of the community turns out from itself in a search for the UNK standard whereby it can measure itself STOP
START for UNK history `` UNK '' rather than UNK precisely when the movement is from order to UNK , and not from one order to a new order STOP
START the UNK split , to define it further , UNK from a basic difference concerning the UNK status of standard sought and about the spiritual experience that leads to its identification STOP
START when UNK change has UNK to the third level of social order , the process of UNK rapidly reaches a point of no return STOP
START indeed , it is probable that this point is reached the moment the third level of change begins STOP
START at that point we reach the `` closed '' historical situation : the situation in which man is no longer free to return to a status UNK UNK STOP
START at that point men become aware of the mystery of history called UNK `` fate '' , or `` destiny '' , or `` providence '' , and feel themselves caught UNK in the UNK of a UNK society STOP
START the reasons for this experience are UNK in the metaphysical characteristics of such a change STOP
START of all forms of being , society , or community , has the greatest element of UNK STOP
START its UNK status is itself most UNK because apart from individual men , who are its `` matter '' , tradition , the `` form '' of society exists only as a shared perception of truth STOP
START the UNK status of society thus is UNK by the psychological status of UNK members STOP
START the content of that psychological status determines , ultimately , the content of civilization STOP
START those social , UNK factors not UNK in the human spirit of the group , ultimately cease to exist STOP
START civilization itself -- tradition -- falls out of existence when the human spirit itself becomes confused STOP
START civilization is what man has made of himself STOP
START its massive contours are UNK in the simple need of man , since he is always incomplete , to complete himself STOP
START it is not enough for man to be an UNK UNK STOP
START he needs UNK completion , he needs , that is , to move in the direction of completion STOP
START and the direction of that movement is determined by his perception of the truth about himself STOP
START he must , consequently , exist as a UNK UNK , developing agent , or he does not exist as man STOP
START thus , it is no UNK intuition , but an UNK conception to say that man and his tradition can `` fall out of existence '' STOP
START this happens at the moment man UNK the perception of moral substance in himself , of a nature that , in UNK words , is UNK as a `` UNK of UNK necessities '' STOP
START an UNK is a man who UNK himself only as `` UNK '' , as existence without substance STOP
START thus human perception and human UNK is the UNK cause of all social change and this most truly when the change reaches the UNK level STOP
START thus with regard to the loss of tradition , in the change from order to UNK the metaphysics of change works itself out as a UNK of the individual soul , a change in which man continues as an objective UNK UNK , but no longer as a man STOP
START further , change is a form of motion , it occurs as the act of a being in UNK UNK as it is in UNK and has not yet reached the UNK of the change STOP
START with regard to the change we are UNK , the question is , at what point does the change become UNK ? ? STOP
START a number of considerations suggest that this occurs early in the process STOP
START change involves the displacement of form STOP
START this means that the UNK of change itself can begin only when the factors UNK to change have already become more powerful than those UNK the UNK form in being STOP
START if the UNK form is to be retained new factors that UNK it must be introduced into the situation STOP
START in the case of social decay , form is UNK simply by the process of UNK with no form at the UNK of the process STOP
START now in the mere fact of the beginning of such displacement we have UNK evidence of the UNK weakness of the UNK form STOP
START and when we consider the UNK hold tradition has on existence , any UNK of that hold UNK a crisis of existence STOP
START the retention of a tradition confronted with such a crisis UNK the introduction of new spiritual forces into the situation STOP
START however , the crisis occurs precisely as a UNK of spiritual forces STOP
START it would seem , therefore , that in a UNK crisis man cannot save himself STOP
START the UNK of the crisis itself would seem to constitute a UNK for the victory of UNK STOP
START and it would seem that history is a witness to this truth STOP
START as a further UNK of the liberal conservative split we may observe that it involves differences in the formula for UNK UNK in history STOP
START these differences , in turn , derive from prior differences concerning the friendly or hostile character of change STOP
START UNK responses STOP
START anxiety and deep UNK are the characteristic responses UNK by the crisis in tradition STOP
START to experience them , it is not necessary for a people to be UNK aware of what is happening to it STOP
START the process of UNK need only UNK the tradition and a series of consequences begin UNK within the individual , while in institutions a quiet but deep transformation of processes occurs STOP
START within the individual the reaction has been called various names , all , however , pointing to the same basic experience STOP
START UNK UNK it as being `` UNK '' , UNK as being `` UNK '' , UNK as being `` UNK '' STOP
START others call it `` alienation '' , and mean by that no simple economic experience ( as UNK does ) but a deep spiritual sense of UNK STOP
START within institutions there is a marked decline of the process of UNK and the UNK of a UNK process which UNK as the earlier one of UNK STOP
START we note the use of UNK as a weapon , the UNK of the masses by propaganda , the `` UNK '' of effort and resources STOP
START within this context of spontaneous and UNK responses to the experience of UNK crisis , two basic organizations of response are UNK : reaction and ideological UNK STOP
START these responses are UNK in terms of characteristics inherent in the crisis STOP
START both are UNK UNK to fail STOP
START the response of reaction is dominated by a concern for what is UNK STOP
START its essence lies in its attempt to UNK previous order through the UNK of UNK forces STOP
START to this end political authority is called upon to exercise its negative and UNK powers STOP
START the UNK assumption of this response is that history is UNK STOP
START seemingly , order is UNK as a kind of UNK UNK now covered by UNK UNK STOP
START the problem is to remove the UNK and thereby UNK the order that was always there STOP
START such a response , of course , UNK the point that in crisis order is going out of existence STOP
START moreover its UNK of UNK but simple resistance is UNK to failure because of the metaphysical weakness of the UNK form of order , once the UNK of change has reached visible proportions STOP
START the most reaction can achieve is UNK , and a UNK that can be maintained only by the UNK of an effort which ultimately UNK itself STOP
START despite the UNK of the response , it is UNK in terms of the crisis of tradition itself STOP
START since a UNK crisis involves also a crisis in private interests and in the ruling class , reaction is normally found among those who feel themselves to be among the ruling class STOP
START their great error is to UNK the responses typical of each of the three types of change STOP
START since UNK change is the most difficult to perceive and UNK , it seldom is given adequate attention STOP
START and the anxiety it UNK is UNK as anxiety over private interest and threatened social status STOP
START the basic truth in the reactionary response is to be found in its realistic assumption of the UNK of the real over the UNK STOP
START but this truth is UNK by its extreme application : the assumption of the separate existence of tradition STOP
START the reactionary UNK the point that tradition exists UNK only in the form of UNK relations STOP
START reactionary theories , for this reason , usually assume some form of UNK theory STOP
START in its UNK formulations , the theory will attack conscious change on the grounds of the independent existence of the community STOP
START in its dynamic form , it UNK the community as the UNK of an UNK force -- the race , for instance , which UNK in history STOP
START in both cases the individual tends to be treated as an instrument of the organic reality STOP
START when the reactionary response is thus UNK by an intellectual defense , the characteristics of that defense are UNK only in terms of the basic attitudes of UNK reaction STOP
START reaction is UNK in a perception of tradition as a whole STOP
START it is a total situation that is defended : the `` good old days '' STOP
START there is no UNK ; ; STOP
START even the UNK features of the past are defended STOP
START the point is that the reactionary , for whatever motive , UNK himself to have been part or a partner of something that extended beyond himself , something which , consequently , he was not able to accept or UNK on the basis of subjective UNK STOP
START the reactionary is confused about the UNK status of a UNK tradition , but he does perceive the unity tradition had when it was healthy STOP
START all of which brings up another problem in the use of UNK insight in a literary work STOP
START is the oedipus complex , the clinical UNK , material for a tragedy ? ? STOP
START if we remove ourselves for a moment from our time and our UNK with mental disease , isn't there something absurd about a hero in a novel who is UNK by his UNK UNK ? ? STOP
START i am not making a clinical judgment here , for such personal UNK are real and are commonplace in the UNK UNK room , but literature makes a different claim upon our UNK than tragedy in life STOP
START a man in a novel who is UNK in his childhood and condemned by unconscious forces within him to UNK repeat his earliest failure in love , only makes us a little UNK of man ; ; STOP
START his tragedy seems UNK and UNK STOP
START now we can argue that the UNK fate of oedipus UNK was nothing more than the UNK unconscious UNK of oedipus UNK UNK , but this UNK of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between a story and a clinical case history STOP
START we can also argue that the three brothers UNK and UNK were the external representatives of an internal conflict within one man , UNK , a conflict having to do with UNK and the wish to possess the father's woman STOP
START but a novel in which one man UNK UNK the divisions within his personality would scarcely merit publication in the UNK UNK STOP
START it is a mistake to look upon the oedipus of oedipus complex as a literary UNK of oedipus UNK STOP
START whatever the psychological truth in the oedipus myth , an oedipus who is drawn to his fate by UNK external forces can carry the symbol of humanity and its UNK crime , and the incest that is UNK UNK the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and UNK us in the secret STOP
START but a modern oedipus who is UNK because he cannot UNK his own childhood is only UNK , and for UNK the mystery in favor of psychological truth he gives up the claim on our UNK STOP
START i am UNK that a UNK approach to the oedipus complex is a blind UNK for a UNK STOP
START the best UNK of the novelist will be UNK on the reader who is UNK against any UNK the novelist may have in store for him STOP
START incest is still a UNK theme , but if it wants to get written about it will have to find ways to surprise the emotions , and there is no better way to do this than that of UNK and symbolic representation STOP
START and the best way to UNK and UNK the elements of an incest story is not to set out to write an incest story STOP
START which brings to mind another UNK story and some interesting UNK in the treatment of the UNK theme STOP
START `` the UNK horse UNK '' is also a story about a UNK love for his mother STOP
START if i now risk some UNK with sons and UNK let it be clear that i am not UNK the two works or UNK their UNK ; ; STOP
START i am only UNK out differences in treatment of a theme and the resultant effects STOP
START `` the UNK horse UNK '' is a fantasy with extraordinary power to UNK the reader -- but we do not know why STOP
START it is the story of the UNK love of a little boy for his cold and UNK mother STOP
START there are UNK scenes in which the little boy on his UNK horse UNK UNK toward the climax that will UNK give him the name of the winning horse STOP
START the child grows rich on his UNK and UNK with his uncle to make secret UNK of his money to his mother STOP
START the story ends in the child's UNK and UNK brought on by the UNK UNK to ride his horse to win for his mother STOP
START the child UNK with his UNK mother at his UNK STOP
START i had read the story many times without asking myself why it affected me or UNK why it did STOP
START but on one occasion when i encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was my patient i began to understand the UNK effects of this story STOP
START it was , of course , a little UNK fantasy of winning his mother to himself , and UNK the father who could not give her the things she wanted -- a classical UNK fantasy if you like -- but if it were only this the story would be UNK STOP
START why does the story affect us ? ? STOP
START how does the UNK UNK its UNK effect upon the reader ? ? STOP
START the UNK is actually felt in the story , a terrible and UNK rhythm that UNK the tragedy STOP
START the UNK , i realized , is the single element in the story that UNK the UNK message , the UNK and unconscious UNK that would UNK the innocence of a child's fantasy and UNK the effects of the work if it were made explicit STOP
START the UNK has the ambiguous function of keeping the UNK UNK UNK and making it present ; ; STOP
START it UNK and yet is UNK ; ; STOP
START a perfect symbol STOP
START and if we understand the UNK as an UNK symbol we can also see how well it serves as the symbol of UNK tragedy STOP
START for this love of the boy for his mother is a UNK and UNK love , UNK by its nature STOP
START we are also struck by the fact that this story of a UNK love for his mother does not UNK , while the UNK love of the man , paul UNK , sometimes UNK STOP
START it's easy to see why STOP
START this love belongs to childhood ; ; STOP
START we UNK it its place there , and in UNK treatment we are given the innocent fantasy of a child , in fact , the form in which UNK love is expressed in childhood STOP
START and when the child UNK in UNK story in a UNK that is somehow brought on by his UNK to win and to make his mother rich , the UNK UNK of such a disease and such a death does not enter into our thoughts at all STOP
START we have so completely entered the child's fantasy that his UNK and his death are the UNK and the necessary conclusion STOP
START i am sure that none of the effects of this story were UNK employed by UNK to describe an UNK fantasy in childhood STOP
START it is most probable that UNK and the oedipus complex never entered his head in the writing of this story STOP
START he was simply writing a story that wanted to be told , and in the writing a childhood fantasy of his own emerged STOP
START he would not have UNK why it emerged , he only wanted to capture a memory to play with it again in his imagination and somehow to UNK and hold in the story the disturbing emotions that accompanied the fantasy STOP
START in our own time we have seen that the UNK UNK to UNK has increased but that the novel itself has not UNK much from this marriage STOP
START UNK hope that modern psychology might yet bring forth a last UNK of the novel has only been partially UNK STOP
START the young writer seems UNK by psychological knowledge ; ; STOP
START he has lost confidence in his own eyes and in the validity of his own psychological insights STOP
START he UNK the insights of psychology to improve his UNK vision but cannot bring to his work the distinctive vision that should be a UNK own STOP
START he has been UNK by the UNK of the unconscious and has lost interest in studying the surfaces of character STOP
START if many of the characters in contemporary novels appear to be the UNK relations of characters in a case history it is because the novelist is often UNK today that those things that we call character UNK themselves in surface behavior , that the UNK is still the executive agency of personality , and that all we know of personality must be UNK through the UNK STOP
START the novelist who has been badly UNK in UNK often gives us the impression that since all men must have an oedipus complex all men must have the same faces STOP
START 2 STOP
START i have argued that oedipus of the oedipus complex has a doubtful future as a tragic figure in literature STOP
START but a writer who has a taste for UNK and who sees incest in all its modern dimensions can let his imagination work on the disturbing UNK in the incest myth , the UNK that strikes right at the center of man's UNK STOP
START moral UNK is seen as the other face of desire , and here UNK UNK to the writer a magnificent UNK and a moral problem of great UNK STOP
START there is probably some significance in the fact that two of the best incest stories i have encountered in recent years are UNK of the incest myth STOP
START the ancient types are UNK in UNK and UNK to be UNK drawn to their UNK , but the myth UNK before the modern truth ; ; STOP
START the UNK speaks false and the dream speaks true STOP
START in both the UNK UNK in ralph UNK UNK man and in thomas UNK the holy UNK , the incest hero rises above the myth by accepting the wish as motive ; ; STOP
START the heroic act is the UNK off of UNK STOP
START thomas UNK wrote the holy UNK in 1951 STOP
START it was conceived as a UNK , a kind of UNK UNK of the UNK of the west , `` UNK die UNK UNK , UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK '' STOP
START he chose a medieval legend of incest , UNK UNK UNK , and freely UNK and UNK other UNK of the west , UNK UNK , language , peoples and times in a master myth in which the old forms continually UNK themselves , as in his previous treatment of joseph STOP
START but the holy UNK is not simply a UNK of old stories for an old man's entertainment STOP
START UNK understood better than most men the incest UNK at the center of the myth and the psychological truth in which UNK is shown as the other face as UNK was for him just the kind of deep and complicated UNK he liked to tell STOP
START and when he UNK the legend of UNK he UNK a modern version in which the medieval players speak contemporary thoughts in UNK language ; ; STOP
START while they move through the UNK of the ancient incest myth and cover themselves through UNK , they reveal the unconscious motive in seeking each other and in the last scene make an extraordinary UNK of guilt in the UNK manner STOP
START UNK is the child of an UNK union between a royal brother and sister , the UNK UNK and UNK STOP
START he is born in UNK after the death of his father and cast UNK soon after birth STOP
START the UNK is discovered by a UNK who brings him home to rear him STOP
START an UNK UNK in the UNK UNK UNK the story of his UNK UNK and is preserved for the child by the UNK of a UNK in the fishing village STOP
START UNK , at seventeen , UNK his story and goes forth as a knight to UNK his UNK STOP
START his sailing UNK is guided by fate to the UNK of his own country at a time when UNK UNK is UNK by the armies of one of her rejected UNK STOP
START UNK UNK the UNK in battle , UNK the city from its UNK and UNK UNK who had fallen in love with the beautiful knight the moment she saw him STOP
START UNK is UNK with their second child when she finds the UNK UNK UNK by her husband , and the UNK of mother and son are revealed STOP
START UNK goes off to do UNK on a rock for seventeen years STOP
START at the end of this period two UNK christians in rome receive the UNK which leads them to seek the next pope on the rock STOP
START UNK comes to rome and becomes a great and beloved pope STOP

START helion knew that he UNK his freedom as much to the UNK of his UNK in UNK 13 , , UNK , as to his own UNK will and love of life STOP
START after that , he declared , `` to return to freedom was to fall to one's knees before the real world and UNK it '' STOP

START UNK UNK : `` but it is impossible ! ! STOP
START everything in the way of representation has already been done by the old UNK '' STOP
START helion , however , UNK to the belief that `` in UNK from the UNK i had also UNK from abstraction '' STOP
START while UNK in his virginia home he wrote a book recording his prison experiences and escape , entitled : they shall not have me published originally in ( UNK ) english by UNK & UNK new york , in 1943 , the book was received by the press as a work of UNK literary power and one of the most realistic accounts of world war 2 , from the french side STOP
START it was very widely read , too ; ; STOP
START and the author , who seemed the UNK of UNK rising spirit of resistance to her UNK , was much UNK for his UNK military action STOP
START but when he showed his new UNK pictures to his artist friends of the abstract camp , they paid him no UNK and drew long faces STOP
START between UNK and 1947 helion had a series of UNK shows -- at the paul UNK UNK in new york and in paris -- of his new realistic pictures STOP
START they UNK the figures of human beings UNK from his UNK since the UNK STOP
START these new pictures UNK on the familiar and commonplace objects that he had heard the men in his prison camp talking about as the things they UNK most , hence associated with the sense of lost freedom : the UNK at the corner , the newspaper UNK , the girls in UNK and windows along the street , the UNK french bread they lacked , the UNK denied them STOP
START one of the pictures was of a man with UNK drawn over his face UNK lighting a UNK ; ; STOP
START others were of men UNK their UNK to each other , carrying UNK with UNK , reading newspapers , or simply showing UNK of bread spread out STOP
START important as was UNK essay , his UNK is so UNK as to deny faulkner the UNK which he obviously has STOP
START he and also UNK and UNK have fallen to the UNK which UNK many of us to read into our authors -- UNK UNK , for example , and UNK UNK -- UNK against UNK , material progress , and science which are genuine UNK of our own but may not have been theirs STOP
START UNK total works today , and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when UNK made his comment , or in UNK , when UNK wrote his essay , reveal no such simple attitude toward the south STOP
START if he is a UNK , he is an UNK UNK STOP
START if he UNK the recent or the present , he UNK the past with no less force STOP
START if he sees the heroic in a UNK or a UNK , he sees also -- and he shows -- the blind and the mean , and he sees the UNK family UNK from within STOP
START if the UNK family produces a UNK UNK , who UNK UNK and UNK in UNK UNK , the UNK family produces a UNK UNK 4 STOP
START faulkner is a most UNK UNK STOP
START others writing on faulkner have found the phrase `` traditional UNK '' either inadequate or UNK STOP
START among them are UNK UNK , william van UNK , and UNK UNK STOP
START they have indicated the direction but they have not been explicit enough , i believe , in pointing out UNK independence , his UNK if not indeed UNK the southern tradition STOP
START UNK is not the mind of the UNK which UNK implies that it is STOP
START he is not one to remain more UNK and UNK within a body of social , cultural , or literary traditions than he was within the traditions -- or possibly the regulations -- governing his UNK in the post office at oxford , mississippi , UNK years ago STOP
START that is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions , of course , that he is UNK in them , in fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his books STOP
START it is to say rather , i believe , that he has brought to bear on the history , the traditions , and the UNK of his region a critical , UNK mind -- the same mind which has made of him an UNK UNK in literary form and technique STOP
START he has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be UNK southern STOP
START the fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a UNK mind does not make him any the less southern , i rather think , for the south has been no more solid than other regions except in the political and related areas where UNK and force and UNK and fear may produce a surface uniformity STOP
START some of us might be inclined to argue , in fact , that an independence of mind and action and an UNK of UNK , either mental or physical , are particularly southern UNK STOP
START there is no necessity , i suppose , to assert that UNK is southern STOP
START it would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly southern UNK than that of his family STOP
START and , after all , he has lived UNK at both oxford , mississippi , and UNK , virginia STOP
START the young william faulkner in new orleans in the UNK impressed the novelist hamilton UNK as obviously conscious of being a UNK , and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so STOP
START besides showing no UNK , apparently , to absent himself from his native region even for short periods , and in addition writing a UNK of books set in the region , he has handled in those books an UNK complete list of matters which have been important in the south during the past hundred years STOP
START it is more difficult with faulkner than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is the source of his knowledge STOP
START his own testimony is that he has read very little in the history of the south , UNK that what he knows of that history has come to him UNK and that he knows the world around him primarily from his own UNK observation STOP
START his UNK of extensive reading UNK , it is no doubt safe to assume that he has spent time UNK himself in southern history and that he has gained some UNK with the chief literary authors who have lived in the south or have written about the south STOP
START to believe otherwise would be UNK STOP
START but in looking at faulkner against his background in mississippi and the south , it is important not to lose the broader perspective STOP
START his earliest work reflected heavy influences from english and UNK writers STOP
START evidence is UNK that early and later also he has been UNK to the UNK UNK , who deal in UNK UNK , to the UNK writing at the end of the preceding century , and in particular to the UNK UNK , henry james and james UNK among them STOP
START his repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction UNK to an independence of mind and an UNK of approach , but it also shows him UNK at many points the stream of literary development back of him STOP
START my intention , therefore , is not to say that UNK awareness has been confined within the UNK of the south , but rather that he has looked at his world as a UNK and that presumably his outlook is southern STOP
START the UNK of UNK novels and stories are by no means new with him , and most of the problems he takes up have had the attention of authors before him STOP
START a useful comment on his relation to his region may be made , i think , by noting briefly how in handling southern materials and southern problems he has UNK from the pattern set by other southern authors while remaining UNK to the essential character of the region STOP
START the UNK UNK has appeared in literature at least since john UNK kennedy published UNK in UNK and in his UNK portrait of frank UNK UNK over his plantation UNK initiated the most persistent tradition of southern literature STOP
START the UNK UNK of the UNK society did not come , however , until after the civil war when southern writers were eager to UNK a way of life which had been destroyed STOP
START as they looked with UNK to a society which had been swept away , they were probably no more than UNK that they painted in colors which had never existed STOP
START their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the south , even while UNK of the war were still sharp STOP
START the tradition reached its UNK , perhaps , in the works of thomas UNK page toward the end of the century , and UNK UNK as late as UNK in the UNK novel so red the rose , by UNK young STOP
START although faulkner was the UNK in his own family to this tradition , he did not have UNK UNK UNK to UNK and UNK the UNK society STOP
START the myth of the southern plantation has had only a UNK relation with UNK , as UNK UNK UNK showed forty years ago , and i suspect it has had a far UNK acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed STOP
START faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his UNK independence of mind and UNK outlook STOP
START without saying or UNK to say that in UNK the UNK and the UNK families UNK chief concern is social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those families he UNK his comment on the UNK UNK as they have existed since the decades before the civil war STOP
START it may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more UNK than in any other regard , for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the UNK UNK of UNK UNK , who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of UNK society STOP
START UNK UNK characters had but few counterparts in earlier southern novels dealing with plantation life STOP
START they have an UNK extending back , however , at least to UNK , when william UNK described the UNK he encountered in the back country of virginia and north carolina STOP
START the chief literary UNK of the UNK UNK appeared in the realistic , humorous writing which UNK in the south and the southwest in the three decades before the civil war STOP
START these UNK of UNK action and UNK language appeared first in local newspapers , as a rule , and later found their way between book covers , though rarely into the UNK UNK beside the UNK volumes of UNK , UNK , UNK , and sir walter UNK STOP
START there is evidence to suggest , in fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were UNK to write them -- or to make them as UNK as they are -- by way of UNK against the artificial UNK which had come to UNK the UNK letters of the south STOP
START william UNK UNK , UNK UNK that he was , UNK for a natural UNK such as he found in his UNK the great UNK , to UNK the pale writings being produced around him STOP
START UNK UNK the UNK tales UNK from the UNK , but he had himself social UNK which would not allow him to UNK them fully STOP
START UNK UNK UNK , a UNK and a college and university president in four southern states , published the earliest of these UNK sketches and in the character UNK UNK , in the accounts of sharp UNK and UNK physical combat , and in the UNK UNK speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him STOP
START others who wrote of low characters and low life included thomas UNK UNK , creator of the big bear of arkansas and tom UNK , the UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK jones UNK , whose character UNK UNK bears a close UNK to UNK UNK in both his UNK to take UNK advantage of all and UNK and the UNK with which he UNK carried out his will ; ; STOP
START and george washington UNK , whose tennessee UNK character UNK UNK UNK more UNK UNK and more UNK pain than any other character in literature STOP
START it would be profitable , i believe , to read these realistic UNK UNK UNK works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and UNK anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to UNK time STOP
START such a comparison UNK us that in UNK low characters in his works faulkner is recording UNK in the south and moreover is following a UNK literary UNK STOP
START such characters , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effects in his novels and tales , as they did in the writing of UNK and UNK and UNK , but it need not be added that he gives them far UNK and more UNK functions than they had in the earlier writers ; ; STOP
START nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly UNK and most successful of his characters STOP
START one of the early UNK already mentioned , thomas UNK UNK , can be used to illustrate another point where faulkner UNK UNK southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials STOP
START UNK came to louisiana from the east as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting of romantic UNK and UNK beauty STOP
START but UNK saw also the UNK of pioneer existence , the cultural UNK of the frontier UNK , and the UNK morality which UNK in the new regions STOP
START as a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and feelings , he wrote on the one hand sketches of UNK hunting trips and on the other an UNK of the village of UNK , arkansas , where no one had ever seen a piano ; ; STOP
START and he wrote also the UNK of frontier humor , `` the big bear of arkansas '' , in which UNK realism is placed UNK the UNK of the UNK UNK and the UNK with which man UNK the UNK and the UNK of nature STOP
START some years ago UNK UNK proposed to an audience made up of members of the british association for the UNK of science that `` man's UNK or UNK UNK are ( now ) in the same case as were his mathematical UNK during the ice age '' STOP
START as a UNK , UNK interests himself in the possibilities of human development , and one thing we can say about this suggestion , which comes from a leading UNK , is that , so far as he is concerned , the scientific outlook places no rigid UNK upon the idea of future human evolution STOP
START this text from UNK is sometimes used by UNK to indicate that they have the permission of the scientists to press the case for a wonderful UNK of UNK powers in human beings STOP
START there may be a case of this sort , but it is not one we wish to argue , here STOP
START even if people do , in a not far distant future , begin to read one UNK minds , there will still be the question of whether what you find in another man's mind is especially worth reading -- worth more , that is , than what you can read in good books STOP
START even if men eventually find themselves able to look through walls and around corners , one may question whether this will help them to live better lives STOP
START there would be UNK to be drawn , of course ; ; STOP
START such UNK are impressive evidence pointing to a conception of the human being which does not appear in the accounts of UNK and organic UNK ; ; STOP
START but the basic UNK of existence would still be UNK , and we should still have to work out the sort of problems we plan to discuss in this article STOP
START all we want from UNK statement is the feeling that this is an open world , in the view of the best scientific opinion , with practically no UNK commitments as to what may happen next , and no important UNK with respect to what may be possible STOP
START it seems quite obvious that all the really difficult tasks of human beings arise from the fact that man is not one , but many STOP
START each man , that is , is both one and many STOP
START he is a UNK of the good society with a plan to put into effect , and he is an individual UNK with something to make for himself and the people of his time STOP
START he is a parent with a child to UNK , here and now , and he is an UNK who UNK about the children half way round the world STOP
START he is a utopian with a UNK in UNK and he is a UNK human made UNK by the circumstances of today STOP
START he can sacrifice himself for UNK and he can sacrifice UNK for himself STOP
START he is a UNK wife who UNK about tobacco UNK on the living room UNK and he is a UNK genius who goes boating with the town baker when UNK from the local university have come to call STOP
START he is the UNK UNK of the status UNK who has raised the UNK structures of the age , and he is the revolutionary poet with a gun in his hand who writes a tragic UNK to UNK for the men he has killed STOP
START what will be the final UNK of the good society ? ? STOP
START for what do the UNK labor ? ? STOP
START here , on a desk , is a UNK of UNK representing the efforts of some of the best men of the day to UNK these questions STOP
START the UNK are about law , the corporation , forms of government , the idea of freedom , the defense of liberty , the various UNK which UNK our major institutions , the gap between traditional social ideals and the working mechanisms that have been set in motion for their realization STOP
START the thing that is notable in all these discussions is the lack of ideological UNK STOP
START there is another kind of UNK , a quiet , sure devotion to the fundamental UNK of human life , but no angry utopian UNK STOP
START actually , you could wish for some passion , now and then , but when you look around the world and see the little UNK of current history which partisan social passions have UNK , you are UNK that in these UNK there is at least some UNK calm STOP
START you could also say that in these UNK is a UNK quality of maturity STOP
START there is essential UNK in reading the writing of men who are not angry , who can UNK without UNK STOP
START this is the good kind of UNK , and with all our problems and crises this kind of UNK has UNK in the united states during recent years STOP
START a characteristic expression of such concern and inquiry is found in joseph UNK introduction to the UNK UNK , a recent UNK study of the institutions of modern democratic society STOP
START UNK gives voice to a UNK that represents , we think , an achieved UNK of UNK thinking STOP
START after UNK about for a way of describing this spirit , we decided that it would be better to use UNK introduction as an illustration STOP
START he begins : `` STOP
START at one time it seemed as if the soviet union had done us a favor by providing a striking example of how not to UNK towards other peoples and other nations STOP
START as things turned out , however , we have not UNK greatly from the lesson : instead of UNK following a national program of our own we have often been satisfied to be against whatever soviet policy seemed to be at the moment STOP
START such activity may or may not have UNK the UNK , but it has frequently condemned america to an UNK UNK that has UNK our effort to give leadership to the free world STOP
START the UNK has been UNK by another bad habit , our tendency to rate the `` UNK '' or `` UNK '' of other nations by the extent to which they UNK the UNK we UNK about ourselves STOP
START since the UNK have little application to reality and are UNK to UNK , the UNK is UNK even in areas of the world where we should expect to find the greatest affection for free government STOP
START UNK at the response to our UNK , we grow more UNK , and worse , we lose our sense of humor and proportion STOP
START UNK is subjected to UNK UNK on UNK by our department of state , and an american president UNK UNK that UNK would be a little less UNK if it were a little more UNK '' STOP
START one thing you can say about UNK is that he does not suffer from any UNK as an american STOP
START those who are UNK fear to be UNK in UNK STOP
START only the strong look UNK at weakness STOP
START the maturity in this point of view lies in its recognition that no basic problem is ever solved without being clearly understood STOP
START UNK continues : `` STOP
START even if the self portrait we UNK for popular consumption were accurate it would be dangerous to present it as a picture of the ideal society STOP
START we would be UNK the special circumstances of other countries STOP
START the picture is the more UNK when it UNK the facts of american life STOP
START the UNK between what we commonly UNK and what we practice or UNK is great , and it does not escape the notice of others STOP
START if our UNK is granted , and it is granted , the UNK can only be explained by the fact that we have come to believe UNK and legend about ourselves in UNK to an understanding gained by earnest UNK STOP
START what is more , the UNK have become so UNK that the very habit of UNK or UNK UNK of low UNK , and men who practice it are UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START although we continue to pay our UNK UNK to `` free private enterprise '' , `` individual initiative '' , `` the democratic way '' , `` government of the people '' , `` competition of the UNK '' , etc, we live rather UNK in a society in which economic competition is UNK in large areas , UNK is UNK representative government , technology is UNK the UNK confidence in his own power to make decisions , and the threat of war is driving him UNK and physically into the ground '' STOP
START the interesting thing about UNK approach , and the approach of the UNK to the UNK UNK ( UNK publications , 1961 ) to the situation of american civilization , is that it is concerned with UNK the psychological relationships which are having a decisive effect on american life STOP
START in an ideological argument , the UNK tend to UNK the table STOP
START they are determined to prove something STOP
START the new spirit , so well illustrated by UNK work , is wholly free of this anxiety STOP
START the problem is rather to find out what is actually happening , and this is especially difficult for the reason that `` we are UNK being defended from a knowledge of the present , sometimes by the very agencies -- our educational system , our mass UNK , our UNK -- on which we have had to UNK most heavily for understanding of ourselves '' STOP
START the introduction continues : `` STOP
START we experience a vague UNK about events , a suspicion that our political and economic institutions , like the UNK in the bottle , have UNK UNK and that we have lost the power to recall them STOP
START we feel UNK at being UNK by a corporation or a union or a television set , but until we have some knowledge about these phenomena and what they are doing to us , we can hardly learn to control them STOP
START it does not appear that we will be delivered from our situation by articles on the national purpose STOP
START the UNK UNK is an attempt to UNK some of the institutions which both reflect and determine the character of the free society today STOP
START the men who UNK on these institutions have , for the most part , come to at least one common conclusion : that many of the great enterprises and associations around which our democracy is formed are in themselves UNK in nature , and possessed of power which can be used to UNK the citizen who is trying to assert his UNK in the modern world '' STOP
START these institutions which UNK names `` UNK UNK '' -- where did they come from ? ? STOP
START of one thing we can be sure : they were not UNK out by the revolutionary UNK of the eighteenth century who formulated the political principles and originally shaped the political institutions of what we term the `` free society '' STOP
START no doubt there are historians who can explain to a great extent what happened to the plans and projects of the eighteenth century STOP
START going back over this ground and UNK the composition of forces which have created the present scene is one of the tasks undertaken by the center for the study of democratic institutions , in santa UNK STOP
START but however we come , finally , to explain and account for the present , the truth we are trying to UNK , right now , is that the makers of UNK and the designers of institutions find it difficult if not impossible to UNK the behavior of the host of all their enterprises STOP
START the host is the flowing life of the human race STOP
START this life has its own UNK and UNK , its own multiple UNK and UNK STOP
START on occasion it produces extraordinary UNK STOP
START should UNK have been able to leave room in his social theory for the UNK of television , atomic energy , and UNK machines ? ? STOP
START how would thomas jefferson feel after reading factories in the field ? ? STOP
START they tell us , sir , that we are free , because we have in one hand a UNK , and in the other a stock UNK STOP
START with these we shape our destiny and own private property , and that , sir , makes ours the best of all possible societies STOP
START the reality of the situation , however , is described by UNK : `` STOP
START many of us may even be UNK relieved at having a UNK UNK to UNK ancient UNK responsibilities to a new UNK of experts STOP
START thus the member of an industrial union comes to regard his officers as business agents who may proceed without interference or recall ; ; STOP
START the UNK UNK his UNK ; ; STOP
START and the citizen UNK his political participation to the mere act of voting -- if he UNK at all '' STOP
START copernicus did not question it , UNK could not STOP
START given the UNK context within which ancient thought UNK , how could anyone have questioned this principle ? ? STOP
START the reasons for this are partly UNK , partly philosophical , and UNK by other aesthetic and cultural factors STOP
START first , the UNK reasons STOP
START the obvious natural fact to ancient UNK was the UNK UNK of the UNK STOP
START not only did UNK like UNK , UNK , and UNK UNK circles around the UNK , but stars which were not UNK rose and set at the same place on the horizon each night STOP
START nor did a UNK stars vary in brightness during the course of their UNK UNK STOP
START the conclusion -- the distances of the UNK did not vary and their UNK were circular STOP
START moreover , the UNK path over earth described a UNK of a great circle ; ; STOP
START this was clear from the UNK of the UNK traced by a UNK before and after UNK STOP
START as early as the UNK century UNK earth was seen to be UNK STOP
START ships UNK UNK over the horizon ; ; STOP
START approaching shore their UNK appeared first STOP
START earth , being at the center of the universe , would have the same shape as the latter ; ; STOP
START so , UNK aristotle argue , although this may not be an UNK reason in favor of UNK STOP
START the UNK shapes of sun and moon were also felt to indicate the shape of UNK things STOP
START in light of all this , one would require special reasons for saying that the UNK of the UNK bodies were other than circular STOP
START why , for example , should the UNK have supposed the UNK UNK of the UNK to be UNK ? ? STOP
START or UNK ? ? STOP
START or angular ? ? STOP
START there were no reasons for such UNK then STOP
START this , UNK with the considerations above , made the circular UNK of UNK bodies appear an almost directly observed fact STOP
START additional philosophical considerations , advanced notably by aristotle , supported further the UNK principle STOP
START by UNK UNK ( UNK ) and UNK ( UNK ) existence , and UNK this with the UNK physics of UNK , aristotle came to speak of the stars as perfect bodies , which moved in only a perfect way , UNK a perfect circle STOP
START now what is perfect motion ? ? STOP
START it must , apparently , be motion without UNK STOP
START because motion which begins and ends at UNK places would ( UNK aristotle ) be incomplete STOP
START circular motion , however , since it is eternal and perfectly continuous , UNK UNK STOP
START it is never motion towards something STOP
START only UNK , UNK things move towards what they lack STOP
START perfect , complete UNK , if they move at all , do not move towards what they lack STOP
START they move only in accordance with what is in their UNK STOP
START thus , circular motion is itself one of the essential characteristics of completely perfect UNK existence STOP
START to return now to the UNK physics , a mixture of UNK , UNK water will , when standing in a jar , separate out with earth at the bottom , water on top , and the air on top of that STOP
START a UNK UNK in the air UNK its UNK and smoke UNK STOP
START this gives a UNK to the UNK order of elements STOP
START thus earth has fallen to the center of the universe STOP
START it is covered ( partly ) with water , air is UNK of that STOP
START pure fire ( the stars ) is in the UNK STOP
START when combined with the metaphysical notion that pure forms of this universe are best UNK when least UNK in a material UNK , it becomes clear that while earth will be UNK on a scale of UNK ratios , UNK bodies will be of a subtle , UNK , UNK existence , in whose UNK pure form will be the dominant component and matter will be absent or remain UNK STOP
START the stars constitute an order of existence different from what we encounter on earth STOP
START this is clear when one UNK the types of motion appropriate to both regions STOP
START a UNK shot up from earth returns UNK to its ' natural ' place of rest STOP
START but the natural condition for the UNK bodies is neither rest , nor UNK motion STOP
START being less UNK by material UNK they UNK more of what is divine STOP
START their motion will be eternal and perfect STOP
START let us UNK the UNK UNK between ptolemaic and UNK astronomy STOP
START UNK , there never was a ptolemaic system of astronomy STOP
START UNK achievement was to have UNK systematic astronomy STOP
START the UNK and the UNK UNK UNK conception of his own task as the provision of UNK tables , independent UNK devices for the UNK of future planetary UNK STOP
START indeed , in the UNK edition of UNK presentation of the UNK there is a chart setting out ( under six distinct UNK ) otherwise UNK UNK for describing the planetary UNK STOP
START no attempt is made by UNK to UNK into a single scheme ( UNK ) , these independent UNK STOP
START they all have this in common : the earth is situated near the center of the UNK STOP
START but that one should UNK all these UNK , run a UNK through the common point , and then scale each planetary UNK larger and smaller ( to keep the UNK from ' UNK ' ) , this is contrary to any intention UNK ever UNK STOP
START he might even suppose the planets to move at UNK STOP
START UNK problem is to UNK where , against the UNK bowl of night , some particular light will be found at future times STOP
START his problem concerns UNK , UNK , and angular UNK STOP
START the distances of these points of light is a problem he cannot master , beyond UNK UNK as to the UNK of the planetary UNK viewed UNK from earth STOP
START but none of this has prevented scientists , UNK , and even historians of science , from speaking of the ptolemaic system , in contrast to the UNK STOP
START this is a mistake STOP
START it is UNK by UNK the UNK UNK in the UNK with the UNK astronomy STOP
START UNK UNK UNK that he could ever explain planetary motion STOP
START this is what UNK the UNK character of his astronomy STOP
START so when UNK , like that of baker set out UNK of the ' ptolemaic system ' , complete with earth in the center and the seven UNK bodies UNK arranged on their several UNK , we have nothing but a UNK UNK idea of what never existed historically STOP
START it is the chief merit in UNK work that all his planetary UNK are UNK STOP
START he cannot , UNK the UNK arc traveled by UNK , without also making UNK about the earth's own motion STOP
START he cannot describe UNK without UNK some form of a UNK problem STOP
START in ptolemaic terms , however , UNK and UNK motion were phenomena UNK , to be explained directly as possible UNK of UNK combinations STOP
START in a systematic astronomy , like that of copernicus , UNK become part of the UNK structure of the system ; ; STOP
START they are no longer a UNK aspect of UNK variable , local planetary UNK STOP
START another contrast stressed when discussing ptolemaic UNK astronomy , turns on the idea of simplicity STOP
START it is often stated that UNK astronomy is ' simpler ' than ptolemaic STOP
START some even say that this is the reason for the ultimate acceptance of the former STOP
START thus , UNK remarks : `` a large number of UNK UNK was needed to explain the observations , but otherwise the ( ptolemaic ) system served well and with UNK precision STOP
START copernicus , by placing the sun at the center of the planetary universe , was able to reduce the number of UNK from UNK to seventeen STOP
START historical records indicate that copernicus was UNK of the fundamental aspects of his so-called ' revolution ' , UNK perhaps of its historical importance , he UNK content with having produced a simpler scheme for UNK STOP
START as an illustration of the principle of simplicity the UNK discovery has a peculiar appeal because it allows simplicity to be UNK ; ; STOP
START it involves a reduction in the number of UNK from UNK to seventeen '' STOP
START without careful UNK this can be UNK STOP
START if in any one calculation UNK had had to UNK UNK UNK all at once , while copernicus never required more than one third this number , then ( in the sense obvious to UNK ) ptolemaic astronomy would be simpler than UNK STOP
START but no single planetary problem ever required of UNK more than six UNK at one time STOP
START this , of course , results from the UNK , ' UNK ' character of ptolemaic theory STOP
START UNK within the UNK UNK always raised questions about planetary UNK STOP
START these could be met only by considering the UNK elements of several planets at one time STOP
START this is more UNK than UNK is ever required to be when he faces his isolated problems STOP
START thus , in no ordinary sense of ' simplicity ' is the ptolemaic theory simpler than the UNK STOP
START the latter required UNK several elements simultaneously STOP
START this was not simpler but much more difficult than exercises within UNK astronomy STOP
START UNK , anyone who UNK that UNK theory of UNK is simpler than UNK , must say rather more to explain how it is that the latter is UNK by UNK , while the former can be managed ( with difficulty ) only by accomplished experts STOP
START in a sense , UNK theory is simpler than UNK , and there is a corresponding sense in which UNK theory is simpler than UNK STOP
START but ' simplicity ' here refers to systematic simplicity STOP
START the number of primitive ideas in UNK theories is reduced to a minimum STOP
START the UNK required to make the theoretical machinery operate are set out UNK and UNK , so that all UNK operations within the theory can be traced UNK back to these UNK , rules , and primitive notions STOP
START this UNK UNK formulation of UNK , but not UNK astronomy STOP
START there are in the UNK no rules for determining in advance whether a new UNK will be required for dealing with UNK in UNK , solar , or planetary behavior STOP
START the strongest appeal of the UNK formulation consisted in just this : UNK , the justification for dealing with special problems in particular ways is completely set out in the basic ' rules ' of the theory STOP
START the UNK UNK are never ' UNK UNK ' , never introduced UNK post UNK just to UNK up within the theory some UNK UNK STOP
START copernicus , to an extent UNK by UNK , UNK to UNK vision STOP
START de UNK is not just a collection of facts and techniques STOP
START it is an organized system of these things STOP
START UNK UNK problems requires , for copernicus , not a random search of UNK tables , but a regular employment of the rules UNK the entire discipline STOP
START hence , noting the simplicity achieved in UNK formulation does not provide another reason for the acceptance of de UNK , another reason beyond its systematic UNK STOP
START it provides exactly the same reason STOP
START UNK UNK often UNK as the UNK of the scientific revolution STOP
START it is really the UNK day of UNK science STOP
START granted , the UNK , philosophical , and cultural UNK initiated by the de UNK were felt with increasing violence during the 300 years to follow STOP
START but , considered within technical astronomy , a different pattern can be traced STOP
START in what does the UNK of UNK consist ? ? STOP
START what in the UNK draws his fire ? ? STOP
START UNK per UNK ? ? STOP
START no STOP
START the formal displacement of the UNK principle far from being UNK primary concern , was introduced only to UNK what seemed to him UNK in orthodox astronomy , namely , the ' UNK ' UNK of UNK UNK : one center from which the UNK distances were calculated , another around which planetary UNK were computed , and still a third center ( the earth ) from which the observations UNK STOP
START this arrangement was for copernicus literally UNK : `` with ( the UNK ) it is as though an artist were to UNK the hands , feet , head and other members for his images from UNK models , each part UNK drawn , but not related to a single body ; ; STOP
START and since they in no way match each other , the result would be a UNK rather than a man '' STOP
START copernicus required a UNK UNK , physically UNK astronomy STOP
START his objective was , essentially , to UNK those aspects of orthodox astronomy responsible for its UNK in achieving these ends STOP
START that such UNK existed within UNK theory was not discovered de UNK by copernicus STOP
START the critical , UNK UNK of UNK of UNK and UNK of UNK provided the context ( a late medieval context ) for UNK UNK own work STOP
START the latter looked backward upon UNK UNK STOP
START without UNK too much , copernicus sought to make orthodox astronomy UNK and UNK acceptable STOP
START he did not think himself to be firing the first shot of an intellectual revolution STOP
START UNK feeling of identity with UNK UNK was UNK by her discovery of the UNK that UNK UNK in the jewish UNK in UNK referred to her as `` the UNK '' STOP
START into the UNK of this UNK of history and human drama henrietta , as every artist UNK to do , UNK UNK of her own UNK insights into human nature and -- especially in the remarkable story of the UNK and conflict between two so UNK and UNK characters as this pair -- into the relations of men and women : `` in their relations , she was the UNK and he the UNK , UNK the UNK STOP
START his feeling always UNK UNK from her STOP
START one is so UNK to think of men as the UNK who need but ask and receive , and women as UNK and UNK , that our UNK are usually UNK on the side of the man whose love is not returned , and we UNK the woman as a UNK STOP
START the very UNK of her convictions and logical UNK of her UNK UNK and UNK him to make greater efforts ; ; STOP

START she had the opportunity that few UNK women can resist , of showing her UNK in argument over a man STOP
START women themselves have come to look upon matters in the same light as the outside world , and scarcely find any wrong in UNK to the UNK of a stronger will , even when their UNK are UNK STOP
START she was UNK herself to UNK which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done STOP
START one who UNK such trials of character is either UNK , UNK or too simple and UNK in faith in mankind to see the danger STOP
START in any case but the last , such a course is sure to UNK itself upon the individual ; ; STOP
START the moral powers no more than the physical and mental , can bear UNK STOP
START and , in the last case , a bitter UNK but too often meets the UNK nature STOP
START '' STOP
START henrietta was UNK in the process of writing , as the born writer does , not merely a channel for the discharge of UNK information but a stimulus to the development of the creative powers of observation , insight and intuition STOP
START UNK was so pleased with the quality of her UNK study of UNK UNK that he considered UNK it to the century magazine or UNK but he decided that its jewish subject probably would not interest them and published it in the UNK , `` so our readers will be UNK instead '' STOP
START under her father's influence it did not occur to henrietta that she might write on subjects outside the jewish field , but she did begin writing for other UNK papers and thus increased her output and her audience STOP
START and she wrote the UNK for an UNK on the subject of UNK UNK performed at the UNK UNK which came in december STOP
START by her eighteenth UNK her bent for writing was so evident that papa and UNK gave her a life of dickens as a UNK to her UNK STOP
START another source of intellectual stimulus was opened to her at that time by the founding of UNK UNK university within walking distance of home STOP
START it was established in a couple of buildings in the shopping district , with only a few professors , but all UNK men , and a few hundred eager students UNK in nearby UNK STOP
START in september UNK thomas UNK , UNK famous UNK , came from england to speak in a UNK UNK at the formal opening of the university ; ; STOP
START and although it was a school for men only , it UNK henrietta an opportunity to attend its public UNK STOP
START in the following year her father UNK to give a course in UNK theology to UNK UNK students , and this brought to the szold house a group of bright young jews who had come to baltimore to study , and who enjoyed being fed and UNK by UNK and UNK by henrietta and UNK , who played and UNK for them in the UNK sitting room on sunday UNK STOP
START from philadelphia came UNK UNK and joseph jastrow STOP
START UNK , judge UNK UNK , came to study UNK STOP
START a UNK , UNK and UNK young man , well connected , and with a UNK for getting in the good UNK of important people , he was bound to go far STOP
START joseph jastrow , the younger son of the distinguished UNK , UNK jastrow , was a friendly , UNK fellow with a little UNK , whose field was psychology , and who was also a UNK and a UNK UNK STOP
START his father was a good friend of UNK szold , and joe lived with the UNK for a while STOP
START both these UNK , who greatly UNK henrietta , were somewhat younger than she , as were also the neighboring UNK boys , who were then studying medicine ; ; STOP
START and bright though they all were , they could not possibly compete for her interest with papa , whose mind -- although he never tried to UNK or UNK lesser lights with it -- naturally UNK theirs and made them seem to her even younger than they were STOP
START besides , miss henrietta -- as she was generally known since she had put up her hair with a UNK in the back -- had little time to spare them from her teaching and writing ; ; STOP
START so UNK UNK became interested in her friend UNK UNK , and joe jastrow -- the only young man who when he wrote had the UNK to address her as henrietta , and signed himself joe -- fell in love with pretty sister UNK STOP
START henrietta , however , was at that time engaged in a UNK correspondence with UNK older and more serious brother , UNK , who was just about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to philadelphia with papa , when he substituted for UNK jastrow at UNK UNK temple there during its UNK absence in europe STOP
START young UNK , who , while attending the university of pennsylvania , also taught and UNK a paper , found time to write henrietta UNK letters on everything that engaged his interest , from the acting of UNK UNK in philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of `` UNK '' on the jewish reform movement being UNK by the UNK union college in UNK STOP
START unlike his younger brother , joe , he never UNK to address her more UNK than as `` my dear friend '' , although he UNK and UNK the UNK and UNK of her style STOP
START and when he complained of the lack of time for all he wanted to do , henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning as she and papa did STOP
START one thing papa had not taught henrietta was how to handle a young man as UNK and UNK as herself STOP
START she could not resist the opportunity `` of showing her UNK in argument over a man '' which she had remarked as one of the `` UNK UNK '' of UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START and in her UNK way , henrietta , who in her story of UNK had indicated her own UNK `` to think of men as the UNK '' and `` women as UNK and UNK '' , felt obliged to UNK UNK any statement of UNK to which UNK jastrow took the UNK exception -- he UNK to her stand on the UNK affair , as well as on the radical UNK of UNK of UNK union college -- until once , in UNK UNK , he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything STOP
START but that did not prevent him from writing more long letters , or from coming to spend his christmas UNK with the UNK , UNK UNK in their pleasant house on UNK street STOP
START UNK : `` little women '' STOP
START `` UNK got father and mother and each other '' said UNK on the first page of UNK UNK little women ; ; STOP
START and , `` i do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world '' , burst out UNK some five hundred pages later in that popular story of the march family , which had first appeared when henrietta was eight ; ; STOP

START UNK , UNK like UNK , was from the start her mother's daughter , UNK for her mother's role in life STOP
START UNK , like UNK march , suffered ill health -- got UNK fever and had to be careful of her heart -- but that never UNK her spirits STOP
START when her right hand was UNK by the UNK , UNK learned to write with her left hand STOP
START she wrote gay plays about the girls for family UNK , like `` oh , what fun ! ! STOP
START a UNK in three acts '' , in which , under `` UNK '' , henrietta appeared as `` a UNK '' , and UNK , who was only a UNK less brilliant in high school than henrietta had been , appeared as `` UNK '' STOP

START but both groups were so closely UNK that despite individual differences the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content -- the one being UNK jewish and the other UNK christian STOP
START the UNK , like the UNK , enjoyed and loved living together , even in troubled times ; ; STOP
START and , as in the march home , any young man who called on the UNK found himself confronted with a UNK of UNK which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them STOP
START this included UNK , UNK , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fell in love , just as papa had first fallen in love with her UNK before he chose her ; ; STOP
START and when a young man like UNK jastrow had enjoyed the szold UNK , he felt obliged to send his respects and his UNK not merely to henrietta , in whom he was really interested , but to all the szold girls and UNK STOP
START and just as `` UNK '' UNK was first attracted to bright UNK march , who found him UNK by her high standards , and then had to content himself with her younger sister UNK , so joe jastrow , who had also been writing henrietta before he came to UNK UNK , had to content himself with her younger sister , pretty UNK STOP
START and like UNK march , who saw her UNK UNK and UNK involved in `` UNK '' before herself , henrietta saw her UNK UNK and UNK drawn outside their family circle by the UNK of UNK , UNK by joe jastrow , and UNK by UNK UNK , a young UNK who would write her romantic UNK of his trips by UNK down the mississippi STOP
START this time he was making no mistake STOP
START UNK -- in her country the UNK was a UNK form of address -- was not only attractive but UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP

START but the years that immediately followed were to be UNK trying , both for wright and his UNK lady STOP
START it must be granted that the UNK of convention , no matter how well UNK one may be , is sure to lead to trouble , or at least to the UNK that goes with social disapproval STOP
START even so , many of the things that happened to wright and UNK seem UNK severe STOP
START their UNK centered on one UNK difficulty : miriam held up the divorce proceedings that she herself had asked for STOP
START reporters began to trail miriam everywhere , and to encourage her to make UNK statements about wright and his UNK STOP
START UNK of UNK , UNK , and UNK legal papers of every sort began to fly through the air STOP
START the UNK miriam would agree to a settlement through her legal representative , then change her mind and make another attack on wright as a person STOP
START at last her lawyer , arthur UNK , gave up the case because she turned down three UNK UNK he arranged STOP
START cloud made an interesting statement in UNK from his UNK : `` i wanted to be a lawyer , and UNK wanted me to be an UNK UNK STOP
START so i got out STOP
START UNK is without funds STOP
START the first thing to do is get her some money by a temporary but definite adjustment UNK a final UNK of the case STOP
START but every time i suggested this to her , UNK turned it down and demanded that i go out and UNK UNK STOP
START i am an attorney , not an instrument of UNK '' STOP
START miriam UNK UNK the free advice of her UNK UNK , and appointed a UNK young man named harold jackson to take his place STOP
START there were three years of this strange warfare ; ; STOP
START and during the unhappy time , miriam often would charge that wright and UNK were UNK against the public order of wisconsin STOP
START yet somehow , when officers were UNK into visiting taliesin to UNK the UNK , they would find neither wright nor UNK at home STOP
START this showed that common sense had not died out at the county and village level -- though why the unhappy and obviously UNK woman was not UNK remains a UNK STOP
START the misery of UNK UNK can be felt today by anyone who studies the case -- it was UNK , UNK , and destructive , with miriam herself bearing the UNK burden of UNK and pain STOP
START to get an idea of the UNK and UNK that was UNK upon wright and UNK , we should bear in mind that the UNK were sometimes led by miriam in person STOP
START one of the most UNK of these scenes occurred at spring green toward the end of the open warfare , on a beautiful day in june STOP
START at this time miriam UNK appeared , UNK on UNK henry UNK , whose name showed him to be a UNK of the UNK UNK in the neighborhood STOP
START a troop of reporters brought up the rear STOP
START miriam was stopped at the taliesin gate , and william UNK , now the estate UNK , came out to UNK STOP
START he said that UNK was not in , and so could not be UNK on something called a peace warrant that miriam was UNK in the air STOP
START miriam now ordered UNK to break down the gate , but he said he really couldn't go that far STOP
START at this point UNK UNK , one of UNK UNK UNK by his first wife , came from the house and tried to calm miriam as she UNK down a no visitors sign and UNK the glass UNK on another sign with a rock STOP
START miriam UNK wright said , `` here i am at my own home , locked out so i must stand in the road '' ! ! STOP
START then she UNK on UNK and UNK , `` you always did UNK UNK work ! ! STOP
START when i take over taliesin , the first thing i'll do is fire you '' STOP
START `` UNK UNK , i think you had better go '' , said UNK STOP
START `` and i think you had better leave '' , replied miriam STOP
START turning to the reporters , she asked , `` did you hear her ? ? STOP
START ' i think you had better leave ' ! ! STOP
START and this is my own home '' STOP
START in the silence that followed , miriam walked close to UNK , who drew back a step on her side of the gate STOP
START then , with UNK eyes and UNK drawn thin , miriam said to the young woman , `` you are UNK -- UNK than you used to be , and you were always very UNK STOP
START you are even UNK than UNK '' STOP
START the UNK expressed by such a scene had the UNK quality of a natural force ; ; STOP
START and it gave miriam UNK a fund of energy like that of a person inspired to complete some great and universal work of art STOP
START as if to make certain that wright would be unable to pay any settlement at all , miriam wrote to prospective UNK UNK him ; ; STOP
START she also went to washington and UNK to senator george william UNK of UNK , the fighting liberal , from whose office a sympathetic but UNK UNK was heard STOP
START then , after UNK to accept a settlement and go through with a divorce , miriam gave a UNK UNK of UNK by suddenly stating , `` i will never leave UNK '' STOP
START under this kind of pressure , it is not surprising that wright would make UNK statements to the newspapers STOP
START miriam had not yet UNK him into UNK her directly , but one can feel the UNK anger in UNK remarks to reporters when he was asked , one morning on arrival in chicago , what he thought of the city as a whole STOP
START first , wright said , he was UNK by the smoke , which fortunately kept him from seeing the UNK town STOP
START but surely michigan avenue was UNK ? ? STOP
START `` that isn't a UNK , it's a UNK '' ! ! STOP
START UNK wright , showing that automobiles were considered to be a danger as early as the UNK STOP
START `` this is a UNK way to live '' , wright went on STOP
START `` you are being UNK by traffic '' STOP
START he was then asked for a solution of the difficulty , and began to talk UNK sense , though private UNK showed through in the UNK of his manner STOP
START `` take a UNK knife and UNK it over the loop '' , wright said STOP
START `` cut off every building at the seventh floor STOP
START spread everything out STOP
START you don't need concentration STOP
START if you cut down these UNK buildings you'll have no more traffic UNK STOP
START you'll have trees again STOP
START you'll have some joy in the life of this city STOP
START after all , that's the job of the architect -- to give the world a little joy '' STOP
START little enough joy was UNK wright in the spring of UNK , when another destructive fire broke out at taliesin STOP
START the first news stories had it that this UNK was started by a UNK of UNK , as though miriam could call down fire from heaven like a UNK of the old testament STOP
START a UNK did take place that night , and fortunately enough , it included a UNK that helped put out the UNK STOP
START later accounts UNK UNK UNK for starting the fire ; ; STOP
START at any rate , heat grew so intense in the main part of the house that it UNK the window UNK , and UNK the UNK pottery to UNK STOP
START wright set his loss at UNK , a figure perhaps justified by the unique character of the house that had been UNK , and the UNK taste that had gone into the selection of the UNK and other things that were destroyed STOP
START in spite of the disaster , wright completed during this period plans for the lake UNK UNK , in which he suggested the shapes of american indian UNK -- a project of great and appropriate UNK , that came to nothing STOP
START amid a UNK of profitable work , the memory of albert UNK UNK stood out in UNK UNK -- the money had quickly UNK away STOP
START a series of conferences with friends and UNK began about this time ; ; STOP
START and the question before these meetings was , here is a man of international reputation and proved UNK power ; ; STOP
START how can he be financed so that he can find the work he ought to do ? ? STOP
START while this was under consideration , UNK as ever wright set about the building of taliesin 3 STOP
START as he made plans for the new taliesin , wright also got on paper his conception of a UNK of steel and glass to house a congregation of all UNK , and the idea for a UNK with a UNK UNK STOP
START years were to pass before these plans came off the paper , and wright was justified in thinking , as the projects failed , that much of what he had to show his country and the world would never be seen except by visitors to taliesin STOP
START and now there was some question as to his continued residence there STOP
START UNK UNK , who had once worked for wright as a UNK , gave a UNK for UNK use that he had seen UNK living at taliesin STOP
START this might put wright in such a bad light before a court that miriam would be awarded taliesin ; ; STOP
START nor was she moved by a letter from wright pointing out that if he was not `` compelled to spend money on UNK UNK bills , UNK hotel bills , and UNK UNK bills '' , he could more quickly provide miriam with a suitable home either in los angeles or paris , as she preferred STOP
START miriam UNK at this , and complained that wright had said UNK things about her to reporters STOP
START his UNK was , `` everything that has been printed UNK to you , UNK to have come from me , was a UNK , and nothing yet has been printed which i have UNK '' STOP
START what UNK miriam was that wright had told the papers about a reasonable offer he had made , which he considered she would accept `` when she UNK of UNK '' STOP
START from her california headquarters , miriam fired back , `` i shall never divorce UNK , to permit him to UNK UNK UNK '' STOP
START then miriam varied the UNK psychological warfare by suddenly UNK a suit for separate maintenance that had been UNK , and asking for divorce on the grounds of UNK , with the understanding that wright would not contest it STOP
START the bank of wisconsin sent a representative to the UNK UNK in madison to give information on UNK ability to meet the terms STOP
START he said that the architect might reasonably be expected to carry his financial UNK if all UNK could be brought to an end , and that the bank would accept a mortgage on taliesin to help bring this about STOP
START miriam said that she must be assured that `` that other woman , UNK , will not be in luxury while i am UNK along '' STOP
START this UNK UNK patience , and in consequence he talked freely to reporters in a madison hotel UNK STOP
START `` UNK laws , speed laws , divorce laws '' , he said , `` as they now stand , UNK the individual , make UNK and law UNK of us in one way or another , and tend to make our experiment in democracy absurd STOP
START if UNK doesn't accept the terms in the morning , i'll go either to UNK or to UNK , to do what i can STOP
START i realize , in taking this stand , just what it means to me and mine '' STOP
START here wright gave a slight UNK of UNK , and continued , `` it means more long years lived across the social grain of the life of our people , making shift to live in the face of popular UNK and UNK as i best can for myself and those dependent upon me '' STOP
START next day , word came that miriam was not going through with the divorce ; ; STOP
START but wright stayed in the united states STOP
START his UNK of japan and UNK had been merely the expression of UNK thinking STOP
START no matter what UNK might UNK him , this most american of artists knew in his heart he could not function properly outside his native land STOP
START in a few weeks miriam made another UNK at taliesin , but was UNK at the locked and UNK gates STOP
START more likely , you simply told yourself , as you UNK us the book , that it UNK little what we UNK providing we UNK the discipline of UNK STOP
START for UNK sake , i will not say that the UNK and UNK UNK UNK of those UNK UNK itself into my soul STOP
START besides , that particular message does no more than UNK UNK the UNK in all fresh blood STOP
START but what you could not know , of course , was how UNK the UNK UNK was to lead into an american UNK of my own UNK under whose UNK we UNK were to come , if not of age , then into a bright , UNK UNK of it STOP
START i do not suppose you ever heard of UNK UNK , living or dead , and moreover i do not suppose that , even if you had , his legend would have seemed to you to warrant more than a UNK of disapproval STOP
START neither his UNK , his UNK , nor his despair were UNK to UNK STOP
START he might have been the man in the moon for all you could have understood him STOP
START but he was no man in the moon to me STOP
START although his UNK nights were not the ones i UNK of , nor was it for UNK , sports cars , tall UNK , and swimming UNK , nor yet for money or what money UNK that i burned , i too was burning and watching myself UNK STOP
START the UNK was simply of a different kind STOP
START it was UNK ( at least for those of us who recognized ourselves in the image ) by that UNK , UNK UNK of UNK UNK UNK , that UNK which from the UNK where she UNK it became a UNK to us , but which in point of fact would have had to be as tall as a UNK UNK to last even the evening , let alone the night STOP
START one should not , of course , UNK the head off a UNK and expect its UNK to UNK on STOP
START yet this passion for passion , now that i look back on it with passion spent , seems somewhat UNK and UNK , though as a UNK miss UNK perfectly controlled her notes STOP
START only what else was she singing but the old song of songs , that most ancient of UNK that nature plays with such UNK response upon young UNK ? ? STOP
START perhaps this is not so little STOP
START perhaps the mere fact that by UNK on the UNK nature can UNK in the most ordinary of us , temporarily UNK , the sleeping poet , and in poets can discover their immortality , is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to which we can UNK ? ? STOP
START one can see it as UNK that an extra hormone UNK fed into our chemistry may UNK us to lay down our lives for a UNK or a friend ; ; STOP
START one can take it as no more than another UNK UNK from the mystery of the soul STOP
START but it could also be looked at from the other end of the spectrum STOP
START one could see this chemical UNK as in itself a UNK STOP
START in any case , miss UNK UNK UNK , her variations on the theme that the world was not only well lost for love but even well lost for lost love , her constant and UNK tragic UNK , so unlike that of UNK since it required no UNK or UNK , drew from the me that i was when i fell upon her UNK an overwhelming UNK STOP
START but all this , i am well aware , is the UNK UNK of love , and although i have always liked to think that it was to the UNK UNK and to that alone that i UNK , i know well enough that it was not STOP
START if i am to speak the whole truth about my knowledge of love , i will have to stop trying to UNK the UNK UNK STOP
START there is another side of love , more nearly UNK by the UNK of the UNK UNK , or better still perhaps by the UNK UNK of the UNK STOP
START whether you experienced the passion of desire i have , of course , no way of knowing , nor indeed have i wished with even the most UNK UNK of a wish to know , for the fact that one UNK by one's mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion makes any UNK upon this part of one's UNK experience more UNK , more UNK , more deeply UNK than an UNK from a UNK STOP
START i UNK from the very thought STOP
START at the same time , i am aware that my UNK could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my UNK as an UNK sign , since theirs is a science of UNK : if one UNK , they say it is because one UNK ; ; STOP
START if one UNK , they say it is because one is afraid ; ; STOP
START if one UNK , they say it is because one desires ; ; STOP
START and according to them , whatever one UNK one feels , what one feels in fact is the opposite STOP
START well , normally UNK or normally normal , UNK or merely UNK ( do the UNK readers , by the way , allow UNK to have moral taste ? ? STOP
START ) , i have never wanted to know what you knew of passion STOP
START you probably would not remember , since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as i , much less their intensity , one UNK UNK on fifth avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the UNK you UNK for me with such UNK at the farm STOP
START i can see us now STOP
START we had been walking quite UNK , for despite your being so small and me so tall , your UNK in those days could easily match mine STOP
START we had stopped before a shop window to UNK its UNK display , when you suddenly turned to me , looking up from beneath one of your wrong UNK , and with your UNK `` UNK '' ! ! STOP
START said : `` there are things i must tell you about this man you are UNK which he does not know himself '' STOP
START if you had UNK right there in the street where we stood , i could not have felt more fear STOP
START with scarcely a UNK of UNK , i fled STOP
START i fled , however , not from what might have been the natural fear of being unable to UNK from you that the things about my UNK -- in the sense you meant the word `` things '' -- which you had been UNK yourself to tell me as a painful part of your UNK duty were things which i had already insisted upon finding out for myself ( despite , i may now say , the UNK UNK of making the discovery on principle , yes , on principle , and in cold blood ) because i was resolved , as a modern woman , not to be a UNK waiting for life but to UNK life by the UNK STOP
START i had developed too UNK a UNK to be afraid of UNK STOP
START what i fled from was my fear of what , UNK , you might UNK , without meaning to , about my father and yourself STOP
START but i can see from this latest UNK of memory how much more arbitrary and influential it is than the will STOP
START while my memory holds with UNK UNK , as i cannot too often stress , to my UNK , when it comes to my UNK , it UNK and UNK and UNK with UNK like a UNK in the hope of UNK me from them STOP
START just as i was about to UNK upon my discovery of the UNK of the UNK of love , memory , UNK at being asked to yield its UNK UNK , UNK ahead of me , calling back over its shoulder : `` UNK it STOP
START cut it out '' STOP
START but i will not UNK it or cut it out STOP
START it is not my intention in this narrative to picture myself as a helpless victim UNK to the rock of experience and left to the UNK of chance STOP
START if to be innocent is to be helpless , then i had been -- as are we all -- helpless at the start STOP
START but the time came when i was no longer innocent and therefore no longer helpless STOP
START helpless in that sense i can never be again STOP
START however , i UNK my hope that i will be innocent again , not with a UNK , UNK innocence , but rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting away of the flesh to reach the bone STOP
START for innocence , of all the UNK of the spirit , is i believe the one most to be UNK for STOP
START although it is constantly made to look UNK ( too simple to come in out of the rain , people say , who have found in the innocent an UNK ) , it does not mind looking UNK because it is not concerned with how it looks STOP
START it UNK that things are as they seem when they seem best , and when they seem worst it UNK them STOP
START to innocence , a word given is a word that will be kept STOP
START UNK , innocence does UNK others as it UNK to be done by STOP
START but when these expectations are once too often ground into the dust , innocence can UNK , since its strength is according to the strength of him who UNK it STOP
START the innocence of which i speak is , i know , not UNK STOP
START but i insist upon UNK that even when it is lost , it may , like UNK , be UNK STOP
START however , it was not of innocence in general that i was speaking , but of perhaps the UNK and surely the least important side of it which is innocence in romantic love STOP
START here , if anywhere , it is not wholly UNK STOP
START to you , for instance , the word innocence , in this UNK , probably retained its UNK , or should i say technical sense , and therefore i suppose i must make myself quite clear by saying that i lost -- or rather UNK over -- what you would have considered to be my innocence two weeks before i was UNK entitled , and in fact by UNK required , to hand it over along with what other goods and UNK i had STOP
START but to me innocence is far less tangible STOP
START i had long since begun to lose my general innocence when i lost my trust in you , but this special innocence i lost before ever i loved , through my discovery that one could UNK with desire and even experience a UNK delight that had nothing , nothing whatever to do with friendship or UNK , let alone with love STOP
START i knew this knowledge to be UNK at the time i acquired it ; ; STOP
START today , these many years later , after all the UNK UNK or UNK to , the UNK UNK and the UNK UNK since UNK , i call it UNK still STOP
START you , i could UNK to it , remained innocent in this sense until the end STOP
START UNK , but not mine , was an age in which innocence was UNK and carefully -- if not perhaps altogether UNK -- preserved STOP
START you had grown up at a time when the most UNK mark of a lady was the UNK me UNK UNK plain across her face STOP
START moreover , because of the particular UNK on your family UNK through what may only have been one UNK moment on your UNK part , and because you had the UNK kitchen and UNK bed of your childhood to UNK , what you obviously most desired with both your conscious and unconscious person , what you bent your whole will , UNK , and intelligence upon , was to be a lady STOP
START before being daughter , wife , or mother , before being UNK ( a word now UNK both UNK and UNK of the UNK you children of UNK UNK on it ) , before being UNK for the poor , progressive about public health , and UNK if somewhat UNK UNK , indeed first and UNK , you were a lady STOP
START there was , of course , more to the portrait of a lady you carried in your UNK eye than the UNK UNK UNK of her virtue STOP
START a lady , you made clear to me both by UNK and example , never raised her voice or UNK in her chair , never failed in social UNK ( in heaven , for instance , would not mention stjohn the UNK head ) , never UNK or UNK or UNK in company , never reminded others of her physical presence by UNK sound or gesture , never UNK in public scenes or private UNK , never spoke of money save in terms of UNK suffering , never UNK or UNK , never stressed but always UNK the UNK of anything from sin to death itself STOP
START with each song he gave verbal UNK STOP
START the songs sandburg UNK often reminded UNK of songs of a UNK character they knew entirely or in UNK STOP
START often these UNK would refer sandburg to persons who had similar UNK or UNK STOP
START in due time sandburg was a walking UNK of american folk music STOP
START after he had finished the first two volumes of his lincoln , sandburg went to work UNK a book of songs out of UNK and childhood days and from the memory of songs others had taught him STOP
START he UNK , found UNK and UNK , UNK on the main design and UNK of UNK with musicians , UNK UNK , and UNK STOP
START the result was a collection of UNK songs , UNK , UNK , brought together from all regions of america , more than one hundred never before published : the american UNK STOP
START each song or UNK was UNK by an UNK note which indicated the origin and meaning of the song as well as special interest the song had , musical arrangement , and most of the UNK and UNK STOP
START the book , published in 1927 , has been selling steadily ever since STOP
START as sandburg said at the time : `` it is as ancient as the medieval european UNK brought to the UNK mountains , it is as modern as UNK , the UNK act , and the latest oil well UNK '' STOP
START UNK never learned STOP
START sandburg is in constant demand as an UNK STOP
START two things contribute to his popularity STOP
START first , carl respects his audience and UNK his speeches carefully STOP
START even when he is called upon for UNK remarks , he has notes written on the back of UNK UNK STOP
START he has his own system of UNK , devised by UNK : `` UNK '' will be `` UNK '' , `` with '' will be `` UNK '' , and `` that '' will be `` UNK '' STOP
START the second reason for his popularity is his complete UNK with the guitar STOP
START it is a mistake , however , to imagine that sandburg uses the guitar as a UNK STOP
START he is no UNK college boy but rather a dedicated , humble , and UNK UNK of this instrument STOP
START at age UNK , he became what he UNK terms a `` pupil '' of UNK UNK , the great UNK of the western world STOP
START it is not easy to become UNK pupil STOP
START one needs high talent STOP
START UNK has written about carl : STOP
START `` his fingers labor heavily on the UNK and he asked for my help in UNK them STOP
START i found that this UNK , UNK boy of UNK UNK to be taught STOP
START there has long existed a UNK affection between us , thus i accepted him as my pupil STOP
START just as in the case of every UNK child , we must watch for the UNK of my teaching to show up in the future -- if he should master all the UNK exercises i UNK on him STOP
START to play the guitar as he UNK will UNK his UNK energy as a historian , a poet and a UNK STOP
START one cause of UNK UNK was the fact that he failed to learn the guitar STOP
START i am certain that carl sandburg will not fall into the same sad philosophy STOP
START the heart of this great poet constantly UNK forth a generous joy of life -- with or without the guitar '' STOP
START the UNK identification of carl sandburg and the guitar is no UNK STOP
START nor does carl UNK this identity STOP
START he is proud of having UNK for a friend and dedicated a poem to him UNK `` the guitar '' STOP
START carl says it is the greatest poem ever written to the guitar because he has never heard of any other poem to that subtle instrument STOP
START `` a UNK UNK always ready to go where you go -- a small friend UNK less than a UNK UNK -- to be shared with few or many -- just two of you in sweet UNK '' STOP
START the new york UNK UNK UNK , UNK UNK , tells an UNK about the time he wanted to take a picture of carl playing a guitar STOP
START carl UNK brought his along STOP
START UNK suggested that they go out and find one STOP
START `` preferably '' , said carl , `` one UNK and UNK , such as might be found in a UNK '' STOP
START they went to the UNK of joseph miller of UNK sixth avenue STOP
START `` UNK was in the shop '' , the UNK UNK story related , `` but was UNK to have UNK picture taken inside , because his business was too ' UNK ' for pictures STOP
START `` but after UNK he asked : ' carl sandburg ? ? STOP
START well you can UNK inside STOP
START `` he wanted UNK to UNK with one of the UNK he had displayed behind glass in the center of his shop , but the poet UNK this somewhat UNK STOP
START ' UNK UNK ' , he said , ' used by radio UNK UNK STOP
START `` he chose one from UNK window , a plain guitar with no UNK UNK STOP
START while the picture was taken , UNK UNK to be generous to UNK increased to the point where he advised , ' i won't even charge you the one dollar rental UNK ' '' STOP
START a UNK UNK STOP
START when someone in the audience rose and asked how does it feel to be a UNK , carl said , `` a UNK is a fellow who UNK UNK with UNK '' STOP
START this has always been UNK attitude STOP
START UNK lewis wrote that when he first knew carl in UNK , sandburg was making UNK a week writing features for the day book and UNK UNK UNK in UNK UNK STOP
START he walked home at night for two miles beyond the end of a suburban UNK STOP
START when fame came it changed sandburg only slightly STOP
START lewis remembered another UNK asking , `` carl , have your ideas changed any since you got all these UNK '' ? ? STOP
START carl thought the question over slowly and answered : `` i know a UNK man who is fed never UNK all the UNK of his UNK , i know that '' STOP
START that was all he said , lewis reports STOP
START that was all he had to say STOP
START in answer to a new york times UNK on what is fame ( `` thoughts on fame '' , october 23 , 1960 ) , carl said : `` fame is a UNK of a UNK STOP
START it comes and goes STOP
START it changes with every generation STOP
START there never were two UNK alike STOP
START one fame is precious and UNK ; ; STOP
START another is a UNK of a UNK '' STOP
START `` UNK , did you once see UNK plain '' ? ? STOP
START the impression you get from carl UNK home is one of UNK and happiness ; ; STOP
START and the UNK and the happiness are even more UNK when no company is present STOP
START carl has been married to paula for UNK years , and he has not made a single major decision without careful consideration and thorough discussion with his wife STOP
START through all these years , UNK has UNK avoided the UNK STOP
START she has shared her UNK UNK , but only within the UNK of their home ; ; STOP
START it is a dedication which began the moment she met carl STOP
START UNK received a UNK UNK UNK key from the university of chicago and she was busy writing and teaching when she met sandburg STOP
START `` you are the ' UNK poet ' '' was her UNK in UNK , and she stopped teaching and writing to UNK herself to the UNK of her UNK career STOP
START she has rarely been UNK with him and , except for UNK UNK anniversary UNK in chicago in 1953 , she has not attended the UNK of UNK , functions , public UNK , and UNK UNK him -- all of this upon her UNK STOP
START even now i will not UNK upon her except to state a few UNK facts STOP
START the only way to describe paula sandburg is to say she is beautiful in a UNK sense STOP
START her clothes , her hair , everything about her is both UNK and simple STOP
START she has small , broad , capable hands and an enormous energy STOP
START she is not only a trained UNK and UNK , but a good architect STOP
START she designed and UNK the building of the UNK , michigan , house , most of which was constructed by one local UNK who carried the heavy beams UNK upon his shoulder STOP
START as the sandburg UNK herd increased , she also designed the UNK UNK to UNK them STOP
START when UNK threatened the foundation of their home in UNK , paula sandburg UNK UNK and arranged the snow fences which helped hold the UNK away STOP
START she was born UNK UNK , her parents UNK from UNK STOP
START her mother called her UNK , a UNK UNK meaning `` UNK '' STOP
START some of the children of the family could not UNK this name and called her paula , a UNK carl liked so much she has been paula ever since STOP

START the united states is always ready to participate with the soviet union in serious discussion of these or any other subjects that may lead to peace with justice STOP
START certainly it is not necessary to repeat that the united states has no intention of UNK in the internal affairs of any nation ; ; STOP
START by the same UNK , we UNK any soviet attempt to UNK its system on us or other peoples by force or UNK STOP
START now this concern for the freedom of other peoples is the intellectual and spiritual UNK which has UNK us with more than forty other nations in a common defense effort STOP
START not for a moment do we forget that our own fate is firmly fastened to that of these countries ; ; STOP
START we will not act in any way which would UNK our UNK commitments to them STOP
START we and our friends are , of course , concerned with UNK STOP
START growing out of this concern is the realization that all people of the free world have a great UNK in the progress , in freedom , of the UNK and newly emerging nations STOP
START these peoples , UNK UNK to UNK themselves to UNK levels of living must not , by our UNK , be forced to seek help from , and finally become UNK UNK of , those who UNK their UNK to freedom STOP
START but they must have technical and investment assistance STOP
START this is a problem to be solved not by america alone , but also by every nation UNK the same ideals and in position to provide help STOP
START in recent years america's UNK and friends in western europe and japan have made great economic progress STOP
START the international economy of 1960 is UNK different from that of the early postwar years STOP
START no longer is the united states the only major industrial country capable of providing substantial amounts of the resources so UNK needed in the newly developed countries STOP
START to remain secure and UNK themselves , UNK nations must extend the kind of UNK to the less fortunate members that will UNK hope , confidence , and progress STOP
START a rich nation can for a time , without UNK damage to itself , pursue a course of UNK , making its single goal the material ease and comfort of its own citizens -- thus UNK its own spiritual and material UNK in a peaceful and UNK society of nations STOP
START but the UNK it will UNK , the isolation into which it will UNK , and the internal moral and spiritual UNK that will be UNK , will , in the long term , bring it to economic and political disaster STOP

START i believe that the industrial countries are ready to participate UNK in UNK the efforts of the developing nations to achieve progress STOP
START the immediate need for this kind of UNK is UNK by the strain in this nation's international balance of payments STOP
START our surplus from foreign business UNK has in recent years fallen substantially short of the expenditures we make abroad to maintain our military UNK overseas , to finance private investment , and to provide assistance to the less developed nations STOP
START in 1959 our UNK in balance of payments approached four billion dollars STOP
START continuing UNK of anything like this magnitude would , over time , UNK our own economic growth and check the forward progress of the free world STOP
START we must meet this situation by promoting a rising volume of UNK and world trade STOP
START further , we must UNK all UNK nations of the free world to work together to help UNK the UNK of UNK from less fortunate STOP
START this UNK in this matter will provide both for the necessary sharing of this burden and in bringing about still further increases in mutually profitable trade STOP

START but , just as we drew on europe for assistance in our earlier years , so now do these new and emerging nations that do have this faith and determination UNK help STOP
START UNK their need , one of the major UNK points of our concern is the UNK region STOP
START here , in two nations alone , are almost five hundred million people , all working , and working hard , to raise their standards , and in doing so , to make of themselves a strong UNK against the spread of an UNK that would destroy liberty STOP
START i cannot express to you the depth of my conviction that , in our own and free world interest , we must UNK with others to help these people achieve their legitimate ambitions , as expressed in their different UNK plans STOP
START through the world bank and other UNK , as well as through individual action by every nation in position to help , we must UNK face this UNK challenge STOP
START i shall continue to urge the american people , in the interests of their own security , UNK and peace , to make sure that their own part of this great project be UNK and UNK supported STOP
START free world decisions in this matter may UNK the difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom STOP
START other countries , some of which i visited last month , have similar needs STOP
START a common meeting ground is desirable for those nations which are prepared to assist in the development effort STOP
START during the past year i have discussed this matter with the leaders of several western nations STOP
START because of its wealth of experience , the organization for european economic cooperation could help with the initial studies needed STOP
START the goal is to UNK all available economic resources in the UNK free world , especially private investment capital STOP
START by extending this help , we hope to make possible the enthusiastic UNK of these nations under UNK UNK STOP
START no more startling contrast to a system of UNK UNK could be UNK STOP
START if we UNK this opportunity to build an age of productive partnership between the less fortunate nations and those that have already achieved a high state of economic UNK , we will make UNK the outlook for a world order based upon security and freedom STOP
START otherwise , the outlook could be dark indeed STOP
START we face , indeed , what may be a turning point in history , and we must act UNK and UNK STOP
START as a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives only from a position of UNK based strength STOP
START no matter how earnest is our quest for UNK peace , we must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in UNK the issue of arms reduction STOP
START until tangible and mutually UNK arms reduction measures are worked out we will not UNK the means of UNK our institutions STOP
START america UNK an enormous defense power STOP
START it is my studied conviction that no nation will ever risk general war against us unless we should become so UNK as to UNK the defense forces we now so UNK support STOP
START it is world-wide knowledge that any power which might be UNK today to attack the united states by surprise , even though we might UNK great losses , would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction STOP
START but i once again assure all peoples and all nations that the united states , except in defense , will never turn loose this destructive power STOP
START during the past year , our long-range striking power , UNK today in UNK bombers , has taken on new strength as the atlas UNK ballistic missile has entered the operational inventory STOP
START in fourteen recent test UNK , at UNK of five thousand miles , atlas has been striking on an average within two miles of the target STOP
START this is less than the length of a jet UNK -- well within the circle of destruction STOP
START UNK , there was an atlas firing last night STOP
START from all reports so far received , its performance UNK to the high standards i have just described STOP
START such performance is a great tribute to american scientists and engineers , who in the past five years have had to UNK time and technology to develop these long-range ballistic missiles , where america had none before STOP
START this year , moreover , growing numbers of nuclear UNK submarines will enter our active forces , some to be armed with UNK missiles STOP
START these remarkable ships and weapons , ranging the UNK , will be capable of accurate fire on targets virtually anywhere on earth STOP
START to meet situations of less than general nuclear war , we continue to maintain our UNK forces , our many service units abroad , our always ready army strategic forces and marine corps divisions , and the civilian components STOP
START the continuing modernization of these forces is a UNK but necessary process STOP
START it is scheduled to go forward at a rate which will steadily add to our strength STOP
START the UNK of a portion of these forces beyond our UNK , on land and sea , is UNK demonstration of our determination to stand UNK with our allies for collective security STOP
START moreover , i have directed that steps be taken to program on a longer range basis our military assistance to these allies STOP
START this is necessary for a UNK collective defense system STOP
START next i refer to our program in space exploration , which is often UNK supposed to be an integral part of defense research and development STOP
START we note that , first , america has already made great contributions in the past two years to the world's fund of knowledge of UNK and space science STOP
START these UNK are of present interest chiefly to the scientific community ; ; STOP
START but they are important foundation UNK for more extensive exploration of outer space for the ultimate benefit of all mankind STOP
START second , our military missile program , going forward so successfully , does not suffer from our present lack of very large UNK engines , which are necessary in distant space exploration STOP
START i am assured by experts that the UNK of our present missiles is fully adequate for defense requirements STOP
START third , the united states is pressing forward in the development of large UNK engines to place vehicles of many tons into space for exploration purposes STOP
START fourth , in the UNK , it is necessary to remember that we have only begun to UNK the environment immediately surrounding the earth STOP
START using UNK systems presently available , we are developing UNK to UNK the world's weather ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK stations to UNK and extend communications over the UNK ; ; STOP
START for UNK aids to give accurate UNK to ships and aircraft ; ; STOP
START and for UNK instruments to UNK and UNK the data we seek STOP
START fifth , we have just completed a year's experience with our new space law STOP
START i believe it UNK in certain UNK STOP
START suggested improvements will be submitted to the congress shortly STOP
START the UNK of the many tasks i have UNK to requires the continuous UNK of the spiritual , intellectual , and economic UNK of american life STOP
START the steady purpose of our society is to assure justice , before god , for every individual STOP
START we must be ever alert that freedom does not UNK through the UNK UNK of UNK controls or the lack of courage to deal UNK with the issues of the day STOP
START a year ago , when i met with you , the nation was emerging from an economic UNK , even though the signs of UNK UNK were not then sufficiently UNK to the doubtful STOP
START today our UNK strength is apparent to everyone STOP
START 1960 UNK to be the most UNK year in our history STOP
START yet we continue to be UNK by UNK UNK STOP
START among current problems that require solutions , UNK in by citizens as well as government , are : STOP
START the need to protect the public interest in situations of prolonged UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START the persistent refusal to come to UNK with a critical problem in one sector of american agriculture ; ; STOP
START the continuing threat of UNK , together with the UNK tendency toward fiscal UNK ; ; STOP
START in certain instances the denial to some of our citizens of equal protection of the law STOP
START the group , upon the UNK of its first press release on december 21 , 1957 , designated itself a `` committee of investigation '' STOP
START in the course of its inquiry , it took testimony from only seven UNK STOP
START it heard bang-jensen twice and his lawyer , UNK UNK , jr, once STOP
START its second press release was on january 15 , 1958 , and it recommended that the secret papers be destroyed STOP
START it also implied that paul bang-jensen had been UNK STOP
START on january 18 , UNK gross conducted a press conference at the UNK an hour STOP
START here , he openly attacked bang-jensen and referred to his `` UNK conduct '' STOP
START this conference was held despite UNK assurance to UNK UNK , who was leaving the same day for puerto rico , that nothing would be done until his return on january 22 , except that the secretary general would probably order the list destroyed STOP
START on january 24 paul bang-jensen , accompanied by UNK UNK , was met by UNK UNK and colonel frank UNK , former police chief of UNK , UNK and now head of UNK police STOP
START the four , UNK in UNK , mounted to the UNK roof of the UNK STOP
START there , UNK UNK a fire in a wire UNK , and bang-jensen dropped four sealed UNK into the UNK STOP
START in one of these he said were notes on the UNK of the UNK UNK STOP
START the method of destroying the evidence UNK paul bang-jensen STOP
START he knew it would be implied that it was done in this way at his UNK STOP
START he was right , and peter marshall could not help but recall UNK UNK words on the subject , `` well , it seemed as good a place as any to do the job '' STOP
START the gross group had been formed for the express purpose of UNK the secretary general STOP
START UNK supposed desire to seek outside legal advice in the UNK of UNK gross is illusion , at best STOP
START UNK , being `` outside '' the UNK only to a physical state , not an objective one STOP
START but by the time the papers were finally disposed of , the group had informed the world of its purpose , its recommendations , and its belief that paul bang-jensen was not of sound mind STOP
START shortly the group would issue its report to the secretary general , UNK paul UNK UNK from the united nations STOP
START the UNK of this UNK UNK would become known to many before it would become known to the man it was written about STOP
START `` until this UNK committee matter came up , bang-jensen was a fine and devoted individual STOP
START i had known him for some years , when i was a UNK and before , and this manner had never been his '' STOP
START UNK UNK UNK back in his chair and told peter marshall how secretary general UNK UNK had , on december 4 , 1957 , called him in as a private lawyer to review UNK conduct `` relating to his association with the special committee on the problem of UNK '' STOP
START the result was the `` gross report '' , prepared by gross , as chairman , with the assistance of two UNK UNK , UNK UNK and UNK de UNK STOP
START `` yes '' , gross went on , `` bang-jensen was an UNK young man STOP
START he had always done well STOP
START never well known , but he had done his work UNK STOP
START '' STOP
START gross had received marshall UNK and they were discussing the case STOP
START `` you know '' , the lawyer said , `` it's difficult to talk like this about a man who can't answer back '' STOP
START gross was behind a UNK desk , only a UNK UNK before him STOP
START marshall sat in one of the several UNK UNK STOP
START outside the office windows , UNK stories above wall street , a light rain was falling STOP
START `` UNK , your report says that ' our function is UNK and advisory and does not in any way UNK from or UNK UNK rights as a staff member STOP
START you know , bang-jensen characterized your committee as having UNK his case '' STOP
START gross UNK his UNK chair STOP
START `` well , how could that have been ? ? STOP
START i don't consider that he was UNK STOP
START we were given a job and we carried it out , and later , his case was taken up by the UNK committee STOP
START `` we have nothing to UNK under a UNK STOP
START we did our job , UNK and UNK UNK and myself , taking evidence from a number of people '' STOP
START `` what did you think about his mental state '' ? ? STOP
START `` i think our report sums up our finding '' , gross answered STOP
START `` don't forget , here was a man who had been UNK his colleagues for almost a year of UNK attempting to present an UNK report STOP
START `` this was not merely UNK errors , but was carried out by UNK UNK in UNK , written charges of serious consequence STOP
START `` this is a UNK thing STOP
START UNK you or i were being accused in this manner , and yet we were doing our level best to carry on our work STOP
START no organization can carry on like that STOP
START `` i've been in government and i can tell some pretty UNK stories about personnel difficulties , so i know what a problem he was '' STOP
START `` what UNK like you to comment on is the criticism UNK at your committee '' STOP
START `` what do you mean '' ? ? STOP
START `` for instance , regarding the fact that the gross committee issued two UNK UNK to the press during its investigation STOP
START you know bang-jensen was told the committee was ' to UNK its views , suggestions and recommendations to the secretary general STOP
START in his own words , bang-jensen ' took it for granted that the group would report to the secretary general UNK and not in public STOP
START he claimed that the release of the preliminary findings was ' UNK to his position ' '' STOP
START gross UNK STOP
START for an UNK he UNK UNK at marshall STOP
START `` listen '' , he said STOP
START `` i thought the entire report was going to be UNK from beginning to end STOP
START but you know bang-jensen launched an active campaign against us in the press STOP
START it was getting so that we , the committee , were being tried STOP
START you can find it in the papers '' STOP
START `` well , as a matter of fact , i've looked through UNK UNK of new york papers for december , 1957 , and UNK found a great deal '' -- STOP
START gross shot another look at marshall STOP
START `` it wasn't necessarily all here in new york STOP
START don't forget the foreign press '' STOP
START `` then what about the second UNK public UNK ? ? STOP
START this cited UNK ' UNK conduct ' '' STOP
START `` the reason for that report was to settle the matter of the list STOP
START as far as i'm concerned , it was a separate matter from the general committee study of UNK conduct STOP
START the january fifteen report recommended that bang-jensen be UNK to UNK the list -- the papers -- in the presence of a UNK officer '' STOP
START `` how about your press conference three days later -- what was the reason for that ? ? STOP
START bang-jensen said you told UNK that you had checked in advance to make sure the term ' UNK conduct ' was not UNK STOP
START he claimed you made other UNK UNK '' STOP
START gross UNK and repeated himself STOP
START `` the entire object of the press conference was to clarify the problem of the list , since many in the press were UNK the UNK it STOP
START what was the list ? ? STOP
START i don't know STOP
START bang-jensen never explained what the documents or papers were that he had in his possession STOP
START `` it was UNK of him to keep them , whatever they were STOP
START he could have been UNK , or his family might have been threatened STOP
START of course the matter caught the UNK attention STOP
START we attempted to conclude this , and did so by having the papers burned STOP
START UNK didn't like the way it was carried out STOP
START it was a sort of UNK affair STOP
START UNK believes the UNK an organization that UNK matters in a UNK way STOP
START '' STOP
START peter marshall reflected STOP
START if UNK had not wanted the list disposed of in this manner , and if bang-jensen had not wanted it -- who had ordered it ? ? STOP
START `` UNK , concerning the formation of your committee , there's the fact that you have been a legal UNK to the UNK the past ; ; STOP
START as i understand it , UNK wanted outside advice STOP
START could you comment on that '' ? ? STOP
START `` i've served as a counsel for the UNK some years , UNK particularly in real estate matters or other problems that the regular UNK staff might not be equipped to handle STOP
START UNK is the UNK chief and a very good man , but he is not fully UNK on some technical points of american law '' STOP
START `` what did you think about UNK UNK of errors and UNK in the UNK report '' ? ? STOP
START marshall asked STOP
START `` those '' ! ! STOP
START gross answered STOP
START `` why , UNK UNK went over and over the report with UNK UNK , trying to check them out STOP
START even after the incident between bang-jensen and UNK in the UNK UNK and this was not the way the chicago UNK presented it '' STOP
START gross reached in his desk and pulled out two newspaper UNK STOP
START one was an article on the UNK UNK UNK from the UNK UNK STOP
START the other was by UNK UNK in the chicago daily UNK STOP
START gross pointed to the UNK story STOP
START `` i know UNK , he's a friend of mine STOP
START he probably didn't mean to write it this way , or maybe he did STOP
START there wasn't any ' violent argument ' between bang-jensen and UNK , as the UNK puts it STOP
START that implies that UNK was on the enemy side STOP
START you see what i mean ? ? STOP
START how it's UNK there -- the word violent STOP
START `` the case was that bang-jensen came up to UNK UNK he had found further errors in the report STOP
START ' i've found errors and i want you to look them over STOP
START so once again UNK had to argue with him about this STOP
START but it wasn't a violent discussion STOP
START and after all this , UNK went over all that bang-jensen had brought up '' STOP
START ( UNK own report , peter marshall reflected , describes the encounter as `` UNK '' STOP
START bang-jensen was in `` UNK condition '' STOP
START ) STOP
START gross stopped briefly , then went on STOP
START `` UNK was responsible for the report STOP
START he has felt terrible about all this STOP
START it was a good report , he did all he could to make it a good report STOP
START when i speak of how UNK felt , i know well STOP
START don't forget , i am an old member of the club , a former UNK STOP
START i think you are being UNK to take these things up now STOP
START `` you know , this UNK in many areas STOP
START it UNK to those who were UNK in the outcome of the UNK situation STOP
START don't forget , the UNK no more than the united states did STOP
START it takes a great deal of sophisticated thought to get the impact of this fact '' STOP
START chapter 22 STOP
START from the home of his friend , UNK UNK , in washington , UNK paul bang-jensen sent a UNK dated december 9 , 1957 , to UNK gross STOP
START it said in part : STOP
START `` the matters to be considered are obviously of a grave character , and i therefore UNK request that the hearing be UNK for two weeks in order that i might make adequate preparation '' STOP
START UNK gross replied the next day , putting the suspended UNK fears to rest STOP
START `` this reveals some UNK on your part STOP
START the group UNK the review is not holding formal UNK STOP
START it wished to pursue , in the course of this review , questions arising from the body of material already in its possession STOP
START '' STOP
START it UNK like a fair enough UNK , peter marshall reflected , and bang-jensen must have thought so too , because on the UNK , he met the group of three on the UNK floor of the UNK STOP
START there , UNK gross further assured him : STOP
START `` we were UNK by the secretary general , as i understand it , to discuss with you such matters as appear to us to be relevant , and we are not of course either a formal group or a committee in the sense of being guided by any rules or regulations of the UNK STOP
START the only rules which i think we shall follow will be those of common sense , justice , and UNK '' STOP
START peter marshall noted that bang-jensen had later referred to his two interviews with the gross group as `` unfortunate experiences '' , and after his second meeting on the UNK the UNK refused to attend further UNK without legal counsel STOP
START marshall UNK the reason for this , and UNK too the replacement of one member of the UNK group STOP
START UNK , after serving gross one week , left for england STOP
START fortunately the hole was found at last and UNK STOP
START another week passed and even the UNK were UNK the voyage STOP
START the UNK was gone and , after all , the two young UNK were on their UNK STOP
START the only UNK difficulty was the food STOP
START in spite of UNK UNK explicit instructions regarding variation of meals , the food did not seem the same as at home STOP
START `` everything UNK UNK from what it does on land and those things i was most UNK of at home , i UNK the most here '' , ann noted STOP
START at last they concluded that the heavy , full feeling in their UNK was due to lack of exercise STOP
START walking was the remedy , they decided , but a UNK full of chicken UNK and UNK was hardly suitable STOP
START UNK was the alternative STOP
START a UNK was found and , like children in school , the UNK UNK for hours at a time STOP
START finally , UNK of so UNK a form of exercise , they decided to dance instead STOP
START it was much more fun , UNK the girls of their old UNK days in the UNK UNK room at UNK STOP
START the weather turned UNK and with it came better UNK , although UNK was still a little UNK STOP
START she could not face coffee or tea without milk , and was always UNK types of food that were not available aboard a sailing ship STOP
START by now she was sure she was going to have a baby , UNK it would be born in india or UNK that november STOP
START she was more UNK than UNK at the prospect of having her first child in a foreign land STOP
START the crew of the UNK never failed to UNK ann , who during her stay in salem must frequently have UNK strong UNK language STOP
START she wrote in her journal , `` i have not heard the least UNK language since i have been on board the UNK STOP
START this is very UNK '' STOP
START she was now UNK the voyage very much STOP
START even the first wave of UNK had passed , although there were moments when captain heard pointed out on his compass the direction of UNK that she felt a little UNK at her heart STOP
START as for UNK , she found him to be `` the UNK '' of UNK STOP
START on UNK , with the permission of captain heard , who usually attended with two of his officers , services were held in the double UNK STOP
START sometimes a ship would be UNK and the UNK pass so close that people could easily be seen on the distant UNK STOP
START captain heard did not UNK with any strange vessels because of the possibility of war between the united states and britain STOP
START as UNK temperatures were encountered ann and UNK were introduced to the UNK of UNK daily in salt water STOP
START when may came the UNK had already crossed the UNK STOP
START they were sailing round the UNK of good hope ; ; STOP
START the weather had turned wet and cold STOP
START at this time UNK wrote in a letter which after their finally landing in india was sent to her mother : STOP
START `` i care not how soon we reach UNK , and are placed in a still room , with a bowl of milk and a UNK of indian bread STOP
START i can hardly think of this simple UNK without UNK , oh , what a luxury STOP
START i have been so UNK of the excessive UNK of the UNK , and the almost UNK UNK after the rain , that i have done little more than UNK on the bed for several days STOP
START but i have been UNK with excellent spirits , and UNK have been running about the UNK , and UNK in our room for exercise , as well as ever '' STOP
START while studying at the UNK in UNK , UNK had been working on a new testament translation from the original greek STOP
START he had brought it along to continue during the voyage STOP
START there was one particular word that troubled his conscience STOP
START this was the greek word most often UNK as `` UNK '' STOP
START born a UNK , he had been UNK as a tiny baby in the usual manner by having a few drops of water UNK on his head , yet nowhere in the whole of the new testament could he find a description of anybody being UNK by UNK STOP
START john the baptist used total UNK in the river UNK for UNK ; ; STOP
START even christ was UNK by this method STOP
START the more UNK looked at the greek word for UNK , the more unhappy he became over its true meaning STOP
START as was only natural he UNK his UNK to ann , UNK UNK that it certainly looked as if their own UNK were wrong and the UNK right STOP
START ann was very troubled STOP
START by this time she had learned that it was UNK to argue with her young husband , yet the UNK fact remained : the american UNK were sending them as UNK to the far east and paying their UNK STOP
START what would happen if UNK `` changed horses in UNK '' ? ? STOP
START UNK and UNK in new england were on friendly terms STOP
START how UNK it would be if the newly appointed UNK UNK should suddenly switch their own beliefs in order to UNK baptist UNK ! ! STOP
START `` if you become a baptist , i will not '' , ann informed her husband , but UNK her threat aside UNK continued to search for an answer to the personal dilemma in which he found himself STOP
START by early june they were a hundred miles off the coast of UNK , by which time all four UNK were UNK UNK STOP
START even UNK could UNK write , `` i know not how it is ; ; STOP
START but i hear the UNK roll ; ; STOP
START see the UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START and the waves threatening to UNK up the UNK ; ; STOP
START and yet remain UNK '' STOP
START ann UNK to the sight of a UNK UNK and two strange UNK birds STOP
START land was near , and on june 12 , one hundred and fourteen days after leaving america , they actually saw , twenty miles away , the coast of UNK STOP
START captain heard gave orders for the ship to be UNK in the bay of UNK until he could obtain the services of a UNK pilot to UNK her through the UNK waters STOP
START sometimes ships waited for days for such a man , but captain heard was UNK STOP
START next day a ship arrived with an english pilot , his UNK , an english youth , and the first UNK the UNK and UNK had ever seen STOP
START a little man with a `` a dark UNK color '' skin , he was wearing `` UNK UNK and a white cotton short UNK '' STOP
START ann was plainly UNK in his appearance STOP
START `` he looks as UNK as you can imagine '' , she decided STOP
START the pilot possessed excellent skill at his calling ; ; STOP
START all day long the UNK slowly made her way through the difficult passages STOP
START UNK , to UNK UNK , his language while thus employed left much to be desired STOP
START he UNK so UNK at the top of his voice , that she didn't get any sleep all the next night STOP
START next morning the UNK was out of the UNK bay STOP
START relieved of the major part of his responsibility for the safety of the ship , the UNK UNK became fewer STOP
START slowly she moved up the UNK river , a mouth of the mighty UNK , toward UNK STOP
START ann was UNK with the view , as were her husband and friends STOP
START running across the UNK , which was empty now that the livestock had been killed and UNK , they UNK the UNK UNK that came from the shore , each pointing out new and exciting UNK to the other STOP
START out came the journal and in it went UNK own description of the scene : STOP
START `` on each side of the UNK , where we are now sailing , are the UNK UNK , as thick together as the houses in our UNK STOP
START they are very small , and in the form of UNK , without either UNK or windows STOP
START they are situated in the UNK of trees , which UNK over them , and appear truly UNK STOP
START the grass and fields of rice are perfectly green , and UNK of cattle are everywhere feeding on the banks of the river , and the UNK are scattered about UNK employed STOP
START some are fishing , some driving the team , and many are sitting UNK on the banks of the river STOP
START the UNK we have passed are much larger than the houses '' STOP
START UNK was just as UNK STOP
START where were the UNK she had expected ? ? STOP
START she was certain now that it would be no harder to bear her child here in such pleasant UNK than at home in the big white house in UNK STOP
START with UNK innocence she wrote of the indians as `` walking with fruit and UNK in their hands , with the UNK children around them STOP
START this is the most delightful trial i have ever had '' , she decided STOP
START the indians who came aboard ship to UNK the mail also interested her greatly , even if she was UNK UNK , according to the customs of the society in which she had been UNK , to find them `` naked , except a piece of cotton cloth UNK around their middle '' STOP
START at last they saw UNK , largest city of UNK and the UNK UNK STOP
START founded august 24 , UNK by job UNK of the east india company , and commonly called `` the city of UNK '' , it seemed a vast and UNK place to ann UNK UNK STOP
START solid UNK buildings painted UNK white , large UNK and tall , UNK UNK UNK as far as the eye could see , while the UNK and harbor were filled with UNK sailing ships STOP
START the noise UNK her STOP
START UNK UNK through the UNK streets UNK UNK in their UNK UNK tongue STOP
START UNK mouth UNK with anticipation when after months of UNK she sat down at last to her UNK milk and fresh bread STOP
START ann , pleased to see her friend happy , was UNK by the new fruits a friend of captain heard had sent on board for their enjoyment STOP
START UNK she UNK her first UNK and another fruit whose taste she UNK to that of `` a rich UNK '' STOP
START though she did not then know its name , this strange new fruit was a UNK STOP
START six STOP
START the first act of UNK and samuel on reaching UNK was to report at the police station , a necessity when landing in east india company territory STOP
START on the way they tried to discover all they could about UNK , and they were disturbed to find that UNK UNK book had not presented an altogether true picture STOP
START he had failed to realize that the UNK were not really UNK him as the important UNK he considered himself STOP
START they were in fact UNK UNK at him , for their king wished to have nothing to do with the western world STOP
START when captain john UNK of salem had visited UNK in UNK his ship , the UNK , had been promptly UNK and taken by her UNK up the UNK river STOP
START although after much trouble he did manage to get it back , he discovered there was no trade to be had STOP
START all captain UNK took back to salem were a few items for the UNK east india museum STOP
START a year later another salem ship returned from UNK with a UNK of UNK UNK which nobody wanted to buy STOP
START after that salem ships decided to UNK UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK appeared to have little knowledge of british power or any idea of trade STOP
START they UNK UNK STOP
START UNK UNK UNK could , on the UNK UNK , take a man's life STOP
START as for UNK , even if they succeeded in getting into the country they probably would not be allowed to UNK the christian faith to the UNK STOP
START UNK UNK or even execution might well be their fate STOP
START `` go back to america or any other place '' , UNK friends of captain heard advised them , `` but put thoughts of going to UNK out of your heads '' STOP
START somewhat UNK , the two american UNK reached the police station where they were questioned by a most UNK UNK STOP
START when he discovered they had received from the company's court of directors no permission to live in india , coupled with the fact that they were americans who had been sent to asia to UNK `` the UNK '' , he became more UNK than ever STOP
START they explained that they desired only to stop in india until a ship traveling on to UNK could be found STOP
START she describes , first , the imaginary reaction of a UNK UNK by this `` UNK UNK '' ; ; STOP
START he is answered by a confused , honest englishman STOP
START the reasons for the UNK joy on this occasion are found to be their UNK of UNK control of the government , their delight at the prospect of a new war , their hopes of having the UNK UNK , and so on STOP
START as for the author of the englishman , UNK UNK UNK that the UNK defense of the protestant cause should be left to `` UNK , UNK steele , and their UNK , with the UNK of young man's UNK '' STOP
START another controversy typical of the war between the englishman and the UNK centered on robert ( later UNK ) UNK , a UNK leader in UNK and a member of the irish UNK council STOP
START on december 21 , the day that the irish house of UNK UNK for removal of sir UNK UNK , their tory lord UNK , UNK UNK made this remark on the defense of UNK by UNK : `` they that have turned the world UNK down , are come UNK also '' STOP
START upon UNK from the lower house of UNK to the house of UNK , he was removed from the UNK council , his remark having been represented as a UNK UNK to the clergy STOP
START steele , who had earlier UNK UNK in UNK UNK , now defended him in englishman UNK , UNK his removal as a UNK to the constitution STOP
START on the other hand , UNK was naturally UNK in the tory press STOP
START swift , in the UNK edition of a UNK to the UNK of UNK introduction , indicated his feelings by including UNK , along with UNK , UNK , and UNK , in the group of those who , like UNK , are engaged in UNK all UNK of the clergy STOP
START in the same way he coupled UNK and UNK in a letter to UNK king , and he had earlier described him as `` the worst of them '' in some `` observations '' on the irish UNK council submitted to oxford STOP
START a month later , in the UNK spirit of the UNK , he used steele's defense of UNK as evidence of his UNK for the clergy , calling steele's position an UNK to the `` whole UNK of UNK '' STOP
START on this issue , then , as on so many in these months , steele and swift took UNK opposed points of view STOP
START in the early months of UNK , the battle between swift and steele over the issue of the succession entered its major phase STOP
START the UNK ended with the publication of steele's crisis on january 19 , and from that point on the fight proceeded at a rapid pace STOP
START in answer to the crisis , swift produced the UNK spirit of the UNK , his most extensive and bitter attack on his old friend STOP
START by this time , as we shall see , the UNK were already planning to `` UNK '' steele for his political writing by UNK him from the house of UNK STOP
START despite his defense of himself in the final paper of the englishman and in his speech before the house , their efforts were successful STOP
START steele lost his seat in parliament , and his personal quarrel with swift , by now a public issue , thus reached its climax STOP
START of all the UNK UNK written in support of the succession , the crisis is perhaps the most significant STOP
START certainly it is the most UNK and elaborate STOP
START UNK agents UNK in promoting UNK , said to have reached UNK , and if one may judge by the reaction of swift and other government writers , the work must have had considerable impact STOP
START steele's main business here is to UNK public opinion to the immediate danger of a UNK UNK STOP
START to this end , the first and UNK section of the UNK UNK all the laws enacted since the revolution to UNK england against the `` arbitrary power of a UNK prince '' STOP
START in his comment on these laws steele sounds all the usual notes of current UNK propaganda , ranging from a criticism of the tory peace to an attack on the UNK of UNK ; ; STOP
START but his principal theme is that the UNK of the UNK , `` our UNK or UNK party '' , UNK an immediate threat to church and state STOP
START like UNK , he UNK the UNK of the people in the face of the crisis STOP
START UNK books striking at the UNK succession , he UNK , are allowed to pass UNK STOP
START in this connection , swift , too , is drawn in for attack : `` the author of the conduct of the allies has UNK to drop UNK about UNK the succession '' STOP
START in his effort to UNK the public from its UNK , steele goes so far as to list catholic UNK of the sort to be expected in the event of a UNK UNK , and , with UNK UNK , he UNK that the only preservation from these `` UNK '' is to be found in the laws he has so UNK cited STOP
START `` it is no time '' , he writes , `` to talk with UNK and UNK , but openly and UNK to UNK our UNK before our enemies have UNK and put their designs in execution against us '' STOP
START steele apparently UNK his UNK in this book too openly and UNK for his own good , since the government was soon to use it as evidence against him in his trial before the house STOP
START in the final issues of the englishman , which ended just as the new session of parliament began , he provided his enemies with still more UNK STOP
START for example , UNK printed the patent giving the electoral prince the title of UNK of cambridge STOP
START in a few months the UNK was to be the center of a controversy of some significance on the UNK question of the protestant succession STOP
START at the order of the UNK UNK , the UNK agents , supported by the UNK leaders , demanded that a UNK of UNK be issued which would call the UNK to england to sit in parliament , thus further UNK the succession by establishing a UNK prince in england before the UNK death STOP
START UNK was UNK , and UNK advised that the request be refused STOP
START oxford , UNK that the law required the UNK of the UNK , took the opposite view , for which the queen never UNK him STOP
START accordingly the request was granted , but the UNK himself , who had not been UNK by his mother , rejected the proposal and UNK his agent UNK , whose UNK handling of the affair had caused the UNK interest to suffer and had made UNK UNK more likely than ever STOP
START steele in this paper is UNK his sympathy for such a plan STOP
START a few days after this englishman appeared , UNK reported to oxford that steele was expected to move in parliament that the UNK be called over ; ; STOP
START UNK then UNK , `` if they could draw that young gentleman into their measures they would show themselves quickly , for they are not UNK to say they want only a head to make a beginning '' STOP
START the final issue of the englishman , UNK for february 15 , ran to some length and was printed as a separate UNK , entitled the englishman : being the close of the paper so-called STOP
START steele's purpose is to present a general defense of his political writing and a UNK of the UNK which had occupied him in the englishman ; ; STOP
START but there is much here also which bears directly on his personal quarrel with swift STOP
START thus he UNK , with considerable justice , that the tory writers have UNK to UNK instead of UNK his UNK STOP
START his birth , education , and UNK , he says , have all been UNK simply because he has spoken with the freedom of an englishman , and he UNK the reader that `` UNK UNK with me , is speaking to a gentleman born '' STOP
START as notable examples of this UNK , he UNK passages from the UNK , `` that UNK of all things '' , and the character of richard steele , which he here attributes to swift STOP
START though put in rather UNK terms , steele's defense of himself has a reasonable basis STOP
START his point is simply that the UNK have UNK him with personal UNK , despite the fact that as a private subject he has a right to speak on political matters without UNK the UNK of the sovereign STOP
START he claims , too , that his political convictions are simply those which are called `` revolution principles '' and which are accepted by moderate men in both parties STOP
START the final section of this UNK is of special interest in a consideration of steele's relations with swift STOP
START it UNK to be a letter from steele to a friend at court , who , in miss UNK opinion , could only be meant as swift STOP
START steele first answers briefly the charges which his `` dear old friend '' has made about his UNK on UNK and his crisis STOP
START then he UNK into an attack on the tory UNK , whom he calls the `` new UNK '' ; ; STOP
START by this term he means to UNK their UNK of acting in the interest of the church despite their own education and manner of life -- a UNK , in other words , at the `` UNK '' in UNK family and at UNK UNK UNK STOP
START the tory leaders , he UNK , are UNK using the church as a political `` UNK '' to increase party friction and keep themselves in power STOP
START this is the principal point made in this final section of englishman UNK , and it UNK steele's efforts in his other writing of these months to UNK the notion of the UNK as a `` church party '' supported by the body of the clergy STOP
START next , steele turns his attention to the `` UNK '' he is UNK STOP
START he explains that there are sometimes UNK UNK , but that too often a man who UNK at court does not UNK to sacrifice his sovereign and nation to his own UNK and UNK STOP
START such , he implies , is the case with his friend , who is not really a new UNK himself but merely a UNK of new UNK STOP
START if `` UNK the UNK '' is really to be taken as swift , the following remark is obviously steele's comment on UNK change of parties and its effect on their friendship : `` i assure you , dear UNK , when i first found out such an UNK in you , as makes you of so UNK a constitution , that you may be worked into any form an UNK UNK , i UNK i should not enjoy your UNK much longer '' STOP
START he UNK his `` letter '' by demanding that UNK be UNK , that the UNK be forced to move farther away from the coast of england , and that the queen and the house of hanover come to a better understanding STOP
START the last point was soon to be included in the `` UNK '' remarks used against him in parliament STOP
START the UNK , during steele's trial a month later , printed an answer from the `` UNK '' UNK to `` UNK at UNK UNK STOP
START he UNK steele's entrance into politics and finds that his present difficulties are due to his habit of UNK to his own abilities and talents achievements which more properly should be UNK to the UNK of his friends STOP
START once more , in other words , steele is said to be UNK to swift for his `` UNK '' ; ; STOP
START this was the form in which their private UNK most often appeared in the tory press , especially the UNK STOP
START in the UNK spirit of the UNK , it may be noted , swift himself UNK UNK steele's reference to his friend at court : `` i suppose by the style of old friend , and the like , it must be some body there of his own level ; ; STOP
START among whom , his party have indeed more friends than i could wish '' STOP
START on february 16 , steele took his seat in parliament STOP
START by now he was UNK a fresh UNK of UNK from tory papers and UNK , and action was being taken to effect his punishment by UNK from parliament STOP
START on the very day that the UNK session began , another `` UNK UNK '' appeared , entitled a letter from the UNK UNK UNK , at UNK , to the UNK UNK UNK STOP
START it is filled with the usual personal UNK of steele , especially of his physical appearance ; ; STOP
START in the opening UNK , too , steele is accused of extreme UNK , of giving `` himself the UNK to all the learned , his UNK , from UNK himself , even down to poet UNK of the UNK '' STOP
START when harold arlen returned to california in the winter of UNK , it was to take up again a UNK with johnny mercer , begun some years before STOP
START the film they did after his return was an UNK bit of nothing UNK out of this world , a UNK on the UNK UNK UNK STOP
START the twist lay in using UNK UNK voice on the sound track while leading man UNK UNK UNK the words STOP
START if nothing else , at least two good songs came out of the project , `` out of this world '' and `` june comes around every year '' STOP
START though they would produce some very UNK and UNK songs , arlen and mercer were not given strong material to work on STOP
START their first UNK came close STOP
START early in UNK they were assigned to a UNK UNK hot UNK STOP
START it UNK to be a reasonably serious attempt at a treatment of jazz musicians , their aims , their problems -- the UNK between the `` pure '' and the `` commercial '' -- and seemed a promising vehicle , for the two men shared a common interest in jazz STOP
START johnny mercer practically grew up with the sound of jazz and the UNK in his ears STOP
START he was born in UNK , georgia , in UNK STOP
START his father , george UNK , was UNK from an UNK southern family that could trace its UNK back to one UNK mercer , who had UNK from UNK in UNK STOP
START the UNK father was a lawyer who had UNK out into real estate STOP
START his second wife , UNK , was the mother of john UNK STOP
START by the age of six young johnny indicated that he had the call STOP
START one day he followed the irish UNK UNK , the town band , to a picnic and spent the entire day UNK , while his family spent the day looking STOP
START the UNK caused his family to assign a full-time maid to keeping an eye on the boy STOP
START but one afternoon UNK met her ; ; STOP
START both were obviously on the way to the mercer home STOP
START the mother UNK , `` UNK johnny , and why did you leave him '' ? ? STOP
START `` there was nothing else i could do '' , the maid answered , satisfied with a rather vague explanation STOP
START but UNK demanded more STOP
START the maid then told her , `` because he fired me '' STOP
START with her son UNK so strong a musical bent his mother could do little else but get him started on the study of music -- though she waited until he was ten -- beginning with the piano and following that with the UNK STOP
START young mercer showed a remarkable lack of UNK for both instruments STOP
START still , he did like music making and even UNK in the chapel UNK of the UNK forest school , near UNK , virginia , where he UNK fine but did not UNK too well STOP
START when he was fifteen john UNK turned out his first song , a UNK little thing he called `` sister UNK , UNK your UNK '' STOP
START if his scholarship and formal UNK were not all they might have been , mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was UNK with a remarkable ear for rhythm and UNK STOP
START from his UNK in UNK , mercer had picked up , along with a soft southern UNK , UNK also of the UNK UNK of africa STOP
START such speech differences made him UNK aware of the UNK and UNK of language STOP
START during the UNK , while he was still in school , mercer worked for his father's firm as a UNK boy STOP
START it generally took well into the UNK for the firm to UNK from the UNK help STOP
START `` UNK give him things to deliver , letters , UNK , UNK and things like that '' , UNK his UNK walter , still in the real estate business in UNK , `` and learn days later that UNK UNK UNK them into his UNK STOP
START there they stayed '' STOP
START this rather UNK attitude toward UNK UNK has seemed to be the dominant UNK in UNK personality ever since STOP
START it is , however , a UNK UNK , or perhaps a UNK , for not only has mercer proved himself to be one of the few great UNK over the years , but also one who can function remarkably under pressure STOP
START he has also enjoyed a successful career as an UNK ( his records have sold in the millions ) and is a sharp UNK STOP
START he has also an extraordinary conscience STOP
START in 1927 his father's business UNK , and , rather than go UNK , mercer senior turned his firm over to a bank for UNK STOP
START he died before he could completely pay off his UNK STOP
START some years later the bank handling the mercer UNK received a check for UNK , enough to clear up the UNK STOP
START the check had been mailed from chicago , the UNK bore no return address , and the check was not signed STOP
START `` that's johnny '' , UNK the bank president , `` the UNK boy in the world , but UNK '' STOP
START but UNK explanation was simple : `` i made out the check and carried it around a few days UNK -- in case i lost it '' STOP
START when he remembered that he might have not signed the check , mercer made out another for the same amount , UNK the bank to destroy the other -- especially if he had happened to have UNK signed both of them STOP
START when the family business failed , mercer left school and on his mother's UNK -- for she hoped that he would become an UNK -- he joined a local little theater group STOP
START when the UNK traveled to new york to participate in a UNK competition -- and won -- mercer , instead of returning with the rest of the company in UNK , remained in new york STOP
START he had talked one other member of the group to stay with him , but that friend had tired of not UNK regularly and returned to UNK STOP
START but mercer hung on , living , after a fashion , in a UNK village UNK UNK STOP
START `` the place had no UNK or UNK , only a UNK '' , his mother discovered when she visited him STOP
START `` johnny insisted on cooking a chicken dinner in my honor -- he's always been a good cook -- and i'll never forget him cleaning the chicken in the UNK '' STOP
START a story , no doubt UNK , for mercer himself UNK it , has him UNK a UNK in those village days STOP
START though merely clear glass , it was a distinctive trade mark for an UNK UNK who hoped to UNK himself upon the UNK of producers STOP
START one day in a bar , so the legend goes , someone put a beer UNK with too much force on the UNK and broke it STOP
START the innocent UNK , filled with that supreme sense of honor found in bars , insisted upon UNK the destroyed UNK -- and did , over the UNK of the former owner -- with a square UNK STOP
START mercer is supposed to have refused it with , `` anyone who UNK a square UNK must be affected '' ! ! STOP
START UNK miller , then assistant director for the UNK UNK , a theatre UNK production , needed a UNK for a song he had written ; ; STOP
START he just happened not to need any UNK at the moment , however STOP
START for him mercer produced the UNK to `` out of breath UNK to death of you '' , introduced in that most successful of all the UNK , by UNK UNK STOP
START this UNK edition also had songs in it by vernon UNK and UNK UNK , by UNK and UNK , and by harry UNK STOP
START entrance into such UNK song writing company encouraged the UNK song writer to take a wife , UNK UNK , a dancer in the UNK STOP
START the UNK took up residence in brooklyn , and mercer found a regular job in wall street `` UNK UNK and bonds '' STOP
START when he heard that paul UNK was looking for UNK to replace the rhythm boys , mercer applied and got the job , `` not for my voice , i'm sure , but because i could write songs and material generally '' STOP
START while with the UNK band mercer met UNK arlen STOP
START he had yet to meet harold arlen , for although they had `` UNK '' on `` UNK UNK UNK '' , mercer and UNK had worked from a lead sheet the composer had furnished them STOP
START the UNK , mercer UNK , was UNK to fit the unusual melody STOP
START UNK UNK association brought him into contact with UNK UNK , whose `` UNK '' mercer UNK as `` UNK '' , in which form it became a hit and marked the real beginning of UNK UNK career STOP
START after leaving UNK , mercer joined the UNK UNK band as a UNK STOP
START with the help of UNK UNK , also in the band , he transformed a traditional jewish melody into a popular song , `` and the UNK sing '' STOP
START the UNK success of `` UNK '' and `` and the UNK sing '' could only lead to UNK , where , besides harold arlen , mercer UNK with harry UNK , UNK van UNK , richard UNK , walter UNK , UNK UNK , and arthur UNK STOP
START mercer has also written both music and UNK for several songs STOP
START he may be the only song writer ever to have UNK with a secretary of the UNK ; ; STOP
START he UNK on a song with william UNK UNK , who was secretary of the treasury , UNK STOP
START when johnny mercer and harold arlen began their UNK in 1940 , mercer , like arlen , had several substantial film songs to his credit , among them `` UNK for UNK '' , `` ride , UNK , ride '' , `` have you got any UNK , baby ? ? STOP

START with harry UNK he did `` the girl friend of the UNK UNK '' , `` UNK UNK '' , and `` you must have been a beautiful baby '' STOP
START UNK UNK are characterized by an UNK ear for UNK UNK , a UNK sense of humor expressed in language with a UNK UNK STOP
START though UNK and capable of turning out a UNK UNK with the best of them , UNK UNK is a highly UNK UNK UNK STOP
START his UNK , UNK working methods , often as not in UNK , were an abrupt change from UNK , so that arlen had to adjust again to another approach to UNK STOP
START there were times that he worked with both UNK simultaneously STOP
START speaking of his work with johnny mercer , arlen says , `` our working habits were strange STOP
START after we got a UNK and the spots for the songs were UNK out , UNK get together for an hour or so every day STOP
START while johnny made himself comfortable on the UNK , UNK play the UNK for him STOP

START arlen , too , worked on other projects at the same time with old friend UNK UNK STOP
START besides doing a single song , `` when the sun comes out '' , they worked on the UNK UNK UNK , for UNK and piano , as well as songs for films STOP
START the UNK UNK is in a sense an extension of the cotton club songs in that it is a collection of negro songs , not for a night club , but for the concert stage STOP
START the work had its beginning in UNK with an UNK musical strain to which UNK set the words `` UNK be no more work ; ; STOP
START UNK be no more worry '' , matching the spiritual feeling of the UNK STOP
START this grew into the song `` big time UNK '' STOP
START by september 1940 the UNK had developed into a collection of six songs , `` four UNK , a dream , and a UNK '' STOP
START the negro composer hall UNK studied the UNK UNK and said of it , `` of all the many songs written by white UNK and UNK what claims to be a UNK UNK in both words and music , these six songs by harold arlen and UNK UNK easily stand far out above the rest STOP

START he had been `` seeing things '' STOP
START the UNK `` ideas '' for news stories or editorial campaigns were by no means always UNK or lacking in merit STOP
START he UNK successfully for the UNK of `` death avenue '' and also brought about the ending of UNK of metropolitan beaches by sewage STOP
START he exposed the UNK UNK with the able assistance of two excellent reporters , UNK UNK and carl UNK STOP
START in the conduct of these and many other campaigns , the hetman proved to be a much UNK UNK than his critics allowed STOP
START it seems to me now , in a long backward glance , that many of the UNK UNK and odd actions -- together with his UNK UNK when UNK the UNK in the name of UNK -- were UNK with the tragedy which was to close over him one day STOP
START alone , rejected on every hand , UNK , and in financial trouble , he UNK from an UNK window of the UNK hotel in UNK STOP
START one finds it difficult to pass UNK on the UNK figure who waited for days for a saving word from his UNK served UNK , UNK STOP
START that word was UNK when the need of it seemed the measure of his despair STOP
START the UNK note , written in pencil upon the back of a used UNK , and UNK to the UNK , makes one wonder about many things : `` god UNK me for everything STOP
START i cannot '' STOP
START much to UNK UNK UNK , as well as my own , i got along UNK with the hetman ; ; STOP
START that is , until i became an editor , hence , in his eyes , a UNK STOP
START not long after colonel van UNK had UNK me on the watson staff i received a salary raise and a contract on the UNK recommendation STOP
START during the next years he gave me the second of the five contracts i would sign with the hearst service STOP
START it was a somewhat unusual thing for a UNK to have a contract in those days before the epidemic of UNK UNK STOP
START i would like to believe that my ability UNK this UNK STOP
START somehow i think that watson paid more attention to me than he otherwise might have because his UNK , colonel van UNK , wouldn't touch me with a UNK blue pencil STOP
START i remember one day when UNK ( and i never knew why he liked me , either ) sent the hetman a UNK : `` please find some more reporters like that young man from UNK '' STOP
START watson showed this wire to colonel van UNK STOP
START the colonel UNK , then made a remark which might be UNK in either of two ways STOP
START `` don't UNK to look any further STOP
START we already have the only one of its kind '' STOP
START the hetman did have friends , but they were mostly outside the newspaper profession STOP
START sergeant UNK UNK , UNK UNK of honor soldier , was one of them STOP
START UNK UNK was another STOP
START i used to go with watson to call on the UNK UNK at his apartment , to sit among the UNK excellent collection of UNK , paintings , and books and drink UNK coffee while watson seemed to UNK out and become almost UNK STOP
START there was one time , however , when his face UNK and he suddenly UNK , `` why did my brother UNK UNK '' ? ? STOP
START i cannot remember UNK UNK , if , indeed , he made one STOP
START if she were not at home , mama would see to it that a fresh white rose was there STOP
START sometimes , mrscoolidge would close herself in the green UNK on the second floor , and play the piano she had brought to the white house STOP
START mama knew she was playing her UNK favorite pieces and feeling close to him , and did not UNK her STOP
START all the rest of the days in the white house would be UNK by the tragic loss , even though the president tried harder than ever to make his little dry UNK and to UNK the people around him STOP
START a little boy came to give the president his personal UNK , and the president gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be shown in STOP
START UNK , the UNK UNK a little over that , and the standing UNK was not mentioned to mrscoolidge STOP
START the president was even more generous with the first lady than he had been before the tragedy STOP
START he would bring her UNK of UNK and other presents to UNK a smile to her UNK STOP
START he brought her UNK STOP
START UNK were short in the days of mrscoolidge , and spanish UNK were thrown over them STOP
START he got her UNK of them STOP
START one UNK was so tremendous that she could not wear it , so she UNK it over the UNK on the second floor , and it hung over the UNK STOP
START the president used to look at it with a UNK of a smile STOP
START mrscoolidge spent more time in her UNK among her UNK collection STOP
START she kept the UNK on the lincoln bed STOP
START at night , when mama would turn back the covers , she would have to take all the UNK off the bed and place them elsewhere for the night STOP
START mama always felt that the collection UNK UNK wish for a little girl STOP
START among the UNK was one that meant very much to the first lady , who would pick it up and look at it often STOP
START it had a tiny UNK tied to its UNK STOP
START an accompanying sympathetic letter explained that inside the UNK was a name for UNK first UNK STOP
START mama knew this UNK was meant to help mrscoolidge overcome her UNK by turning her eyes to the future STOP
START the name inside the UNK was `` UNK '' STOP
START the UNK life , after the death of their son , was UNK than ever STOP
START john was away at school most of the time STOP
START mrscoolidge would UNK , and the president would sit reading , or playing with the many UNK around them STOP
START now and then , the president would call for `` little UNK , master of the UNK '' , which was his UNK for a UNK who had worked in the white house since UNK UNK administration , and discuss the welfare of some one of the animals STOP
START it was part of little UNK work to look after the dogs STOP
START one white house dog was UNK in a painting STOP
START that was UNK roy , who UNK with mrscoolidge for the portrait by UNK chandler UNK STOP
START to get him to UNK , mrscoolidge would feed him UNK , so he enjoyed the portrait sessions as well as she did STOP
START i would like to UNK out a UNK about the dress mrscoolidge is wearing in this painting STOP
START it is not the same dress as the one on her UNK in the UNK STOP
START people think the dress in the picture was UNK by an artist much later on STOP
START this is not true STOP
START the dress in the painting is a bright red , with UNK forming a spray on the right side STOP
START there is a long train flowing from the shoulders STOP
START mrscoolidge gave mama this dress for me , and i UNK it many times STOP
START i still have the dress , and i hope to give it to the UNK institution as a UNK , or , as i more UNK hope , to present it to a museum containing articles showing the daily lives of the UNK -- if i can get it organized STOP
START but to get back to the UNK household , mrscoolidge so obviously loved dogs , that the public sent her more dogs -- UNK UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START the last two were a red and a black UNK STOP
START UNK roy remained UNK of all the dogs STOP
START he showed them what to do , and taught them how to keep the UNK around the white house in a state of UNK STOP
START the dogs would run through the UNK after him like a burst of bullets , and all the UNK would run for cover STOP
START mama didn't know what to do -- whether to tell on UNK roy or not -- since she had the ear of mrscoolidge more than the other UNK STOP
START but she was afraid the first lady would not understand , because UNK roy was a perfect UNK with the first family STOP
START every day , when the president took his UNK , UNK roy would stretch out on the window seat near him , like a perfect gentleman , and UNK UNK out the window , or he would take a little UNK himself STOP
START he would not make a sound until the president had UNK and left for the office ; ; STOP
START then he would UNK to let everyone know the coast was clear STOP
START his signal was for the other dogs to come running , but it was also the signal for mama and the other UNK to watch out STOP
START UNK roy was UNK to UNK the president to his office every morning STOP
START UNK roy was well aware of the importance of this mission , and he would walk in front of the president , looking neither to the right nor to the left STOP
START at dinner , lunch , or breakfast , the president would call out , `` UNK '' ! ! STOP
START -- he called all meals UNK -- after the UNK had announced the meal STOP
START all the dogs would UNK to get on the UNK with the president and go to the dining room STOP
START they would all lie around on the UNK during the meal , a very pretty sight as UNK roy , UNK , and UNK UNK were all UNK STOP
START when UNK and UNK were too young to be UNK in the dining room , they were tied to the UNK with their UNK , and they would cry STOP
START mama tried to talk to them and keep them quiet while she UNK up the sitting room before the first family returned STOP
START finally , mama did mention to mrscoolidge that she felt UNK for the little dogs , and then mrscoolidge decided to leave the radio on for them while she was gone , even though her husband UNK of the waste of electricity STOP
START mama was now the first maid to mrscoolidge , because UNK , the previous first maid , had become ill and died STOP
START mrscoolidge chose mama in her place STOP
START it was a high mark for mama STOP
START every first family seems to have one couple upon whom it UNK for true friendship STOP
START for the UNK , it was UNK UNK UNK of boston , massachusetts , owners of a large department store STOP
START they seemed to be at the white house half the time STOP
START the UNK were UNK because when the UNK were there , the president would say grace at breakfast STOP
START if the UNK were not there , grace would be UNK STOP
START speaking of breakfast , the president UNK a new custom -- that of UNK business at the breakfast table STOP
START the word was that this too was part of an economy move on his part STOP
START a new bill had been passed under UNK that designated the government , rather than the president , as the UNK for official meals STOP
START so the president would make a UNK breakfast official by UNK government officials to attend STOP
START he caused a lot of talk when he also chose the breakfast hour to have the UNK come in and trim his hair while he UNK STOP
START mama said that if UNK were supposed to be colorful , UNK certainly made a good president STOP
START he knew exactly how to be colorful ! ! STOP
START the favorite guest of the house , as far as the staff was concerned , was UNK , the UNK UNK king STOP
START the white house had UNK UNK until it could UNK no more , and every christmas , UNK sent the president a check for UNK , to be divided among all the help STOP
START you can imagine that he got pretty good service STOP
START another good friend of the UNK was george UNK , who was the ambassador to great britain from UNK to UNK STOP
START he had been a friend of the UNK , and continued to be invited by the UNK STOP
START the first UNK whom mama ever waited on in the white house was queen UNK of UNK , who came to a state dinner given in her honor on october 21 , UNK STOP
START she was not an overnight guest in the white house , but UNK UNK , the chief UNK , had mama check her UNK coat when she came in , and take care of her needs STOP
START mama said she was one of the UNK UNK she had ever seen STOP
START mama was very UNK , and one of the duties she was UNK of was UNK the edges of the UNK that UNK above the white house STOP
START actually , two UNK were used at the UNK -- a small one on UNK days , and a big one on bright days STOP
START the UNK would become UNK around the edges from blowing in the wind , and mama would UNK it STOP
START she would often go up on the roof to see the UNK take down the UNK in the evening STOP
START she used to tell me , `` when i stand there and look at the UNK blowing this way and that way , i have the wonderful , safe feeling that americans are protected no matter which way the wind UNK '' STOP
START even when mrscoolidge was in UNK for her son , she reached out to help other people in trouble STOP
START one person she helped was my brother STOP
START mama had told her how UNK lungs had been affected when he was UNK in the war STOP
START he was in and out of mount UNK hospital for UNK any number of times STOP
START taking a personal interest , she had the doctor assigned to the white house , UNK UNK , look UNK over STOP
START as a result , he was sent to a hospital in UNK until his health improved enough for him to come back to washington to work in the government service STOP
START but again , there was danger that his lungs would suffer in the UNK washington weather , and he had to return to the dry climate of the west to live and work STOP
START when mrscoolidge was in UNK , she did not wear black STOP
START she UNK UNK every day , and white every evening STOP
START mama knew that she was out of UNK when she finally UNK bright colors STOP
START the president helped her a lot by selecting some lovely colored UNK to get her started STOP
START she opened the UNK with a UNK in her eye and a sad smile on her face STOP
START on the social side , the UNK mama had at the formal UNK at the white house UNK her the most STOP
START it was her job to stand at the foot of the UNK , and , just as the first lady stepped off the last UNK , mama would UNK out her long train before she UNK to the blue room to UNK her guests with the president STOP
START mama would enjoy the sight of the famous guests as much as anyone , and would note a UNK here and there to tell me about that night STOP
START one night , mama came home practically in a state of shock STOP
START she had stood at the bottom of the UNK , as usual , when mrscoolidge came down , in the same dress that is now in the UNK , to UNK her guests STOP
START mama UNK down to UNK the train , but there was no train there ! ! STOP
START she reached and reached around the dress , but there was nothing there STOP
START she looked up and saw that , without knowing it , mrscoolidge was holding it UNK STOP
START mrscoolidge looked down , saw UNK UNK expression and quickly let the whole thing fall to the floor STOP
START mama UNK the train in place , and not a step was lost STOP
START the UNK did not always live at the white house during the UNK STOP
START impressive as this UNK is , it barely UNK at the diverse UNK of jews , UNK or individually , that have been UNK by their UNK environment STOP
START it is reasonable to affirm two UNK : jews have been UNK by UNK as all things to all men ; ; STOP
START some jews have in fact been all things to all men STOP
START in the UNK of power jews have at one time or another been UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START they have observed correct UNK ; ; STOP
START they have been UNK enemy STOP
START in the market place jews have in fact under various circumstances been UNK customers and UNK , or UNK UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START and so on through the roles referred to in the previous UNK STOP
START diversity of perception , yes ; ; STOP
START diversity of fact , yes STOP
START but the two do not invariably or even typically UNK STOP
START the `` conventional '' image of a particular time and place is not necessarily UNK with the image of the facts as established over the years by UNK and scientific research STOP
START conventional images of jews have this in common with all UNK of a UNK in which one feature is held constant : images can be both true and false STOP
START the UNK interesting question , then , becomes : what factors determine the degree of realism or UNK in conventional images of jews ? ? STOP
START the working test of `` the facts '' must always be the best available description obtainable from scholars and scientists who have applied their methods of investigation to relevant situations STOP
START granted , such `` functional '' images are subject to human error ; ; STOP
START they are UNK in the sense that they are subject to UNK procedures that check and UNK against error STOP
START in accounting for realism or UNK two sets of factors can be UNK distinguished : current intelligence ; ; STOP
START UNK regarding intelligence STOP
START general grant may have been the victim of false information in the instance reported in this book ; ; STOP
START if so , he would not be the first or last UNK officer who has UNK to bad information and UNK estimates of the future STOP
START but general grant may have been UNK STOP
START he may have entered the situation with UNK that prepared him to act UNK in the press of affairs STOP
START UNK , in turn , fall UNK into two categories for purposes of analysis STOP
START to some extent UNK are shaped by exposure to group UNK STOP
START in some measure they depend upon the structure of individual personality STOP
START the anti-semitism of UNK UNK something to his exposure to the UNK of UNK UNK successful christian socialist movement in UNK STOP
START but millions of human beings were exposed to UNK propaganda and record STOP
START after allowing for group UNK , it is apparent that other factors must be considered if we are to UNK UNK STOP
START these are personality factors ; ; STOP
START they include UNK and UNK within the whole man , and mechanisms whereby inner components are more or less UNK met STOP
START modern UNK knowledge provides us with many UNK to UNK the significance of behavior of the kind STOP
START the UNK factors are pertinent to the analysis of UNK images and the broad conditions under which they achieve realism or fall short of it STOP
START undoubtedly one merit of the vast UNK of UNK UNK of the jew UNK in the present UNK is that it provides a formidable body of material that UNK critical examination in terms of reality STOP
START many UNK are themselves UNK contributions to this UNK STOP
START undoubtedly , however , the significance of the volume is greater than the UNK paragraphs suggest STOP
START speaking as a UNK i believe that its primary contribution is in the realm of future policy STOP
START since we can neither UNK nor UNK the past , we are limited to the events of today and UNK STOP
START in this UNK the simple fact of UNK in the same local , national , and world community is enough to UNK that we cannot UNK from having some effect , large or small , upon UNK relations STOP
START what shall these effects be ? ? STOP
START i am deliberately raising the policy problems involved in UNK relations STOP
START comprehensive examination of any policy question calls for the performance of the intellectual tasks UNK from any UNK method STOP
START the tasks are briefly indicated by these questions : what are my goals in UNK relations ? ? STOP
START what are the historical trends in this country and abroad in the extent to which these goals are effectively realized ? ? STOP
START what factors condition the degree of realization at various times and places ? ? STOP
START what is the probable course of future developments ? ? STOP
START what policies if adopted and applied in various circumstances will increase the UNK that future events will UNK with desired events and do so at least cost in terms of all human values ? ? STOP
START it is beyond the UNK of this UNK to cover policy questions of such depth and range STOP
START the discussion is therefore limited to a suggested procedure for UNK at least some of the potential importance of this volume for future policy STOP
START as a UNK for the proposal i give some attention to the first task UNK above , the UNK of goal STOP
START my UNK is that i associate myself with all those who affirm that UNK relations should contribute to the theory and practice of human dignity STOP
START the basic goal finds UNK expression in the universal declaration of human rights , a statement initiated and UNK by individuals and organizations of many religious and philosophical traditions STOP
START within this frame of reference policies appropriate to claims advanced in the name of the jews depend upon which jewish identity is involved , as well as upon the nature of the claim , the characteristics of the UNK , the UNK proposed , and the UNK of the community decision makers who are called upon to act STOP
START if jews are identified as a religious body in a controversy that comes before a national or international UNK , it is obviously compatible with the goal of human dignity to protect freedom of worship STOP
START when decision makers act within this frame they determine whether a claim put forward in the name of religion is to be accepted by the larger community as appropriate to religion STOP
START since the recognition of UNK as a nation state , claims are made in many cases which identify the UNK as a member of the new body UNK STOP
START community decision makers must make up their minds whether a claim is acceptable to the larger community in terms of prevailing expectations regarding members of nation states STOP
START in free countries many UNK involve UNK jews who use the symbol in UNK a UNK `` cultural '' rather than religious or political identity STOP
START the decision UNK who acts for the community as a whole must decide whether the objectives UNK and the methods used are appropriate to public policy regarding cultural groups STOP
START we know that much is made of the UNK and UNK of the UNK that UNK around the key symbol of the jew STOP
START many public and private UNK will undoubtedly continue to reflect these UNK in the mind and usage of UNK and jew STOP
START however , in the context of legal and UNK policy , these UNK are less than novel STOP
START they involve similar UNK regarding the multiple UNK of any number of UNK groups STOP
START so far as the existing body of formal principle and procedure is concerned , UNK UNK are not to be UNK in UNK relationships ; ; STOP
START claims are properly disposed of according to norms common to all parties STOP
START it is not implied that formal principles and procedures are so firmly UNK within the public order of the world community or even of free UNK that they will control in all circumstances involving jews and UNK during coming years STOP
START social process is always UNK in past UNK ; ; STOP
START but it is UNK UNK in situations where UNK are UNK or lost STOP
START in UNK with the UNK principle we affirm that UNK relations will be UNK or UNK to the degree that one relation or the other is expected by the active UNK to yield the greatest net advantage , taking all value outcomes and effects into consideration STOP
START it is not difficult to UNK circumstances in which negative tensions will UNK ; ; STOP
START for instance , imagine the situation if UNK ever UNK an enemy UNK STOP
START the formal position of americans who identify themselves with one or more of the several UNK of the jewish symbol is already clear ; ; STOP
START the future weight of UNK factors cannot be so easily UNK STOP
START when we consider the UNK state of the world community , and the UNK of UNK UNK directed against all who are identified as jews , it is obvious that the struggle for the minds and muscles of men needs to be UNK with increasing UNK and skill STOP
START during moments of intense crisis the responsibility of political leaders is overwhelming STOP
START but their freedom of policy is limited by the pattern of UNK with which they and the people around them enter the crisis STOP
START at such critical moments UNK favorable to human dignity most obviously `` pay off '' STOP
START by the same test UNK destructive of human personality exercise their most UNK impact , with the result that men of good will are often UNK and UNK STOP
START among measures in anticipation of crisis are plans to UNK into the UNK as UNK of key decision makers qualified persons who are UNK of the UNK effect of crisis upon personal relationships and are also able to raise calm and realistic UNK when UNK leaders near the limit of UNK STOP
START we are learning how to do these things in some of the vast organized structures of modern society ; ; STOP
START the process can be UNK STOP
START a UNK is that the time to prepare for the worst is when times are best STOP
START during UNK periods the educational facilities of the community have the possibility of UNK the UNK and UNK the behavior of vast numbers of human beings of every age and condition STOP
START as more men and women are made capable of living up to the challenge of UNK the UNK are improved that the pattern of UNK prevailing in positions of strength in future crises can be favorably affected STOP
START now an UNK difficulty of paragraphs like the UNK is that they appear to UNK ; ; STOP
START and in contemporary society we often UNK of too much UNK of the UNK of the good STOP
START in any case i do not UNK to let the present occasion pass without dealing more directly with the problem of UNK good UNK STOP
START i assume that the number of readers of this UNK who regard themselves as UNK perfect is small , and that most readers are willing to consider procedures by which they may gain more insight into themselves and better understanding of others STOP
START properly used , the present book is an excellent instrument of UNK STOP
START let us not UNK the issue by UNK the objective or the method `` UNK '' , for this is a well established term of art for the specific ideas and procedures initiated by UNK UNK and his UNK for the study and treatment of UNK UNK STOP
START the traditional method UNK by the technique of free association , UNK by UNK proposed by the UNK UNK STOP
START what we have in mind does have something in common with the goals of UNK and with the methods by which they are sought STOP
START for what we UNK , however , a UNK is not necessary , even though one aim is to enable the reader to get beneath his own UNK -- his UNK of himself to himself STOP
START for this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement is necessary ; ; STOP
START but involvement needs to be accompanied by a special frame of mind STOP
START the relatively long and often colorful UNK in this UNK enable the reader to become UNK absorbed in what is said , whether he UNK with anger or UNK STOP
START but simple involvement is not enough ; ; STOP
START UNK calls for an open , UNK , UNK UNK of UNK STOP
START the UNK provides an opportunity to UNK the self with specific statements which were made at particular times by UNK UNK who were UNK definite audiences -- and throughout several hundred pages everyone is talking about the same key symbol of identification STOP
START an advantage of being exposed to such UNK about an important and UNK feature of social reality is that it can be taken advantage of by the reader to examine UNK as well as UNK UNK within himself , UNK UNK by explicit symbols UNK around the central figure of the jew STOP
START two UNK of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for our time STOP
START one , a UNK on the point i have just made , is the phenomenon of UNK , UNK , and UNK , which fromm discussed in the escape from freedom STOP
START in essence this involves UNK one's thought and emotion in the values and experience of others , rather than in one's own values and experience STOP
START there is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself , reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be UNK else STOP
START clearly what the person brings to the reading is important STOP
START moreover , if the critic UNK his audience in what to see in a work , he is contributing to this UNK ; ; STOP
START if he UNK them in how to evaluate a work , he is helping them to achieve their own identity STOP
START the second UNK part of this sketch of literature and the search for identity has to do with the difference between good and UNK literary works and the UNK mass culture products of today STOP
START in the range and variety of characters who , in their literary lives , get along all right with life styles one never UNK possible , there is an UNK lesson in UNK STOP
START the reader , UNK this process , might ask `` why not be different '' ? ? STOP
START and find in the answer a license to be a UNK of the human species STOP
START the observer of television or other products for a mass audience has only a permit to be , like the models he sees , even more like everybody else STOP
START and this , i think , holds for values as well as life styles STOP
START one would need to test this proposition carefully ; ; STOP
START after all , the large ( and probably UNK ) UNK UNK literature on the `` most UNK character i ever met '' deals with village UNK , country doctors , favorite if UNK UNK , and so forth STOP
START scientists often turn out to be UNK , too STOP
START but still , the proposition is worth examination STOP
START it is possible that the study of literature affects the conscience , the morality , the sensitivity to some code of `` right '' and `` wrong '' STOP
START i do not know that this is true ; ; STOP
START both UNK and UNK west deal with the development and nature of conscience , as do such UNK as UNK and UNK STOP
START it forms the core of many , perhaps most , problems of UNK STOP
START i am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the UNK profession to the role of literary study in the development of conscience -- most of their attention is to a UNK period of life , or , for the UNK of course , to the influence of religion STOP
START still , it would be surprising if what one UNK did not contribute to one's ideas of right and wrong ; ; STOP
START certainly the UNK UNK over the UNK books and the continuous concern over UNK literature indicate some UNK aspects of this influence STOP
START probably the most important thing to focus on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the UNK of conscience , the code which is UNK to the developed or UNK conscience available STOP
START this is in large part a code of behavior and a UNK of values : what is it that people do and should do and how one should regard it STOP
START in a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth-century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her UNK , how to UNK , how to think about this new experience , how to exercise UNK STOP
START literature may be said to give people a sense of purpose , dedication , mission , significance STOP
START this , no doubt , is part of what UNK UNK implies when he says of the arts , `` they give form and meaning to life which might otherwise seem UNK and without sense '' STOP
START men seem almost UNK to want a sense of function , that is , a feeling that their existence makes a difference to someone , living or UNK , close and immediate or UNK STOP
START feeling UNK seems generally to be an UNK UNK STOP
START a need so deeply UNK , asking for direction , so to speak , is likely to be UNK by the vivid examples and heroic proportions of literature STOP
START the terms `` UNK '' and `` UNK '' , which often come up in aesthetic discussion , seem partly to derive their UNK from the `` UNK '' of purpose and a `` UNK '' sense of significance a person may receive from poetry , drama , and fiction STOP
START the notion of `` UNK '' is somehow UNK to this feeling STOP
START how literature does this , or for whom , is certainly not clear , but the content , form , and language of the `` message '' , as well as the source , would all play UNK parts in giving and molding a sense of purpose STOP
START one of the most UNK features of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and organization of emotion STOP
START let us UNK a few of these ideas STOP
START the UNK notion of UNK , the UNK of emotion , is a persistent and UNK one STOP
START the idea here is one of discharge but this must stand in opposition to a second view , plato's notion of the UNK of emotion STOP
START a third idea is that artistic literature serves to reduce emotional UNK , giving a sense of UNK and calm to individuals STOP
START this is given some expression in UNK notion of harmony and the resolution of UNK STOP
START a fourth view is the transformation of emotion , as in UNK fine phrase on the arts : they `` UNK and UNK our inner nature '' STOP
START it is possible that the idea of UNK of emotion is a fifth idea STOP
START UNK , in his discussion of the `` functions and future of poetry '' , suggests this : `` one of the things which makes our lives UNK and empty and which leaves us , at the end of the day , UNK and UNK UNK is the pressure of the UNK , practical , UNK concern of UNK objects STOP
START if art is to release us from these UNK things ( things we must think UNK about ) and bring us back to the UNK beauty and UNK of the aesthetic component of reality in its UNK , it must UNK its connection with these common sense UNK '' STOP
START i take the central meaning here to be the contrast between the UNK empty quality of life without literature and a life UNK by it STOP
START UNK view of the aesthetic experience might constitute a sixth variety : for him it UNK , in part , the organization of UNK STOP
START a sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account of all of these STOP
START but there is one in particular which , it seems to me , UNK special attention STOP
START in the wide range of experiences common to our UNK race none is more difficult to manage , more UNK , and more UNK in its effects than the control of love and hate STOP
START the study of literature UNK to this control in a curious way STOP
START william UNK and UNK UNK , it seems to me , have a UNK insight into the way in which this control is UNK : `` for if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love ( and yet not aim at exciting UNK emotion or even an emotion of UNK UNK ) and if it is to talk of anger and murder ( and yet not aim at UNK anger and UNK ) -- then it may be that the poetic way of dealing with these emotions will not be any kind of UNK , UNK , or UNK , or any direct assault upon the UNK at all STOP
START something indirect , mixed , UNK , UNK might well be the UNK , the UNK technique by which a poet UNK in all kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like `` expressions '' of these emotions , without UNK at their UNK or even UNK anything that essentially involves their UNK '' STOP
START the UNK through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions may be a most valuable human experience STOP
START here i do not mean UNK , the discharge of emotion STOP
START i mean something more like UNK concept of the utility of `` play '' to a small child : he plays `` house '' or `` doctor '' or `` UNK '' as a way of UNK slightly UNK experiences , UNK them UNK until they are under control STOP
START there is a second feature of the influences of literature , good literature , on emotional life which may have some special value for our time STOP
START in UNK UNK of the UNK and UNK youth of london , a UNK finding was the inability to UNK UNK , a need to satisfy UNK immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of UNK the experience STOP
START perhaps it is only an analogy , but one of the most obvious differences between UNK fiction and fiction of an UNK quality is the development of a theme or story with UNK and anticipation STOP
START anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what i mean STOP
START it is at least possible that the capacity to UNK UNK is developed as well as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature STOP
START in any inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions , particularly with respect to the sense of harmony , or relief of tension , or sense of `` a transformed inner nature '' which may occur , a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produces the effect would be required STOP
START in the calm which follows the reading of a poem , for example , is the effect produced by the enforced quiet , by the musical quality of words and rhythm , by the UNK or sense of the poem , by the associations with earlier readings , if it is familiar , by the UNK to the UNK for the UNK , by the UNK of attention , by the sense of security in a UNK UNK , by a kind license for some variety of fantasy life regarded as UNK , or by UNK ideas about the magical power of words ? ? STOP
START these are , if the research is done with UNK and skill , UNK UNK , but the research is UNK STOP
START one of the most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of UNK that it is thought to provide STOP
START UNK is a vague word , covering an area of meaning rather than any precise talent , quality , or skill STOP
START among other things it means perception , discrimination , sensitivity to subtle differences STOP
START both the extent to which this is true and the limits of the field of UNK skill involved should be UNK STOP
START its truth is illustrated by the skill , sensitivity , and general UNK of the english professor with whom one UNK the theatre STOP
START the limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment : contrast the UNK skill of english professors with that of their colleagues in UNK among motor cars , political candidates , or female beauty STOP
START along these lines , the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than i have seen STOP
START in a UNK and general exploration of the field of personal perception and UNK behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK shows the UNK stability of UNK based on UNK ( hot , sweet , bitter , UNK dealing with personal qualities of human beings and events STOP
START but to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to UNK and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an UNK UNK STOP
START i would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what i shall call depth STOP
START i use this term to mean three things : a search for the human significance of an event or state of affairs , a tendency to look at UNK rather than parts , and a tendency to respond to these events and UNK with feeling STOP
START it is the UNK of UNK , UNK , emotional UNK STOP
START i think these attributes UNK , but i have no evidence STOP
START in fact , i can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide , continuous , and properly guided exposure to literary art STOP
START the late UNK , a philosopher whose work has proved helpful to many students of literature , once wrote `` : : STOP
START we are all , though many of us are UNK enough to wish to deny it , in far closer sympathy with the art of the UNK and UNK than with UNK and UNK , or even shakespeare and UNK STOP
START by an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the art of a remote past or an UNK present , and enjoy the UNK of UNK and japanese UNK ; ; STOP
START but the possibility of this effort is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries , and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not taken place STOP
START the natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy contemporary art , to UNK and UNK the art of the recent past , and wholly to ignore everything else '' STOP
START one might argue that the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship is to correct this spontaneous UNK that is likely to UNK the UNK of the general public , of the newspaper critic , and of the creative artist himself STOP
START there results a study of literature UNK from the UNK of the contemporary STOP
START such study may take many forms STOP
START the study of ideas in literature is one of these STOP
START of course , it goes without saying that no student of ideas can UNK ignore the contemporary scene STOP
START he will frequently return to it STOP
START the UNK , UNK , and UNK UNK when past and present are UNK together are UNK and the one is often understood through the other STOP
START when we assert the value of such study , we find ourselves committed to an important assumption STOP
START most students of literature , whether they call themselves scholars or critics , are ready to argue that it is possible to understand literary works as well as to enjoy them STOP
START many will add that we may find our enjoyment UNK by our understanding STOP
START this understanding , of course , may in its turn take many forms and some of these -- especially those most interesting to the student of comparative literature -- are essentially historical STOP
START but the historian of literature need not UNK his attention to UNK or to UNK questions of form , `` UNK '' , or technique STOP
START he may also consider ideas STOP
START it is true that this distinction between style and idea often approaches the arbitrary since in the end we must admit that style and content frequently influence or UNK one another and sometimes appear as expressions of the same insight STOP
START but , in general , we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other STOP
START at this point a working definition of idea is in order , although our first definition will have to be qualified somewhat as we proceed STOP
START the term idea refers to our more UNK or UNK consciousness as opposed to the UNK of UNK or emotional experience STOP
START it is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy STOP
START an idea , let us say , may be roughly defined as a theme or UNK with which our reflection may be concerned STOP
START in this essay , we are , along with most historians , interested in the more general or more UNK ideas , that are so to speak `` UNK large '' in history of literature where they UNK continually STOP
START outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself , including the many UNK that have been advanced over the centuries ; ; STOP
START also secondary notions such as the UNK of man , the UNK of man , and the dignity of man STOP
START one might , indeed , argue that the history of ideas , in so far as it includes the UNK , must center on UNK of human nature and that the great periods of literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by reference to the images of human nature that they UNK in UNK STOP
START we need not , to be sure , expect to find such ideas in every piece of literature STOP
START an idea , of the sort that we have in mind , although of necessity readily available to imagination , is more general in UNK than most poetic or literary images , especially those UNK in UNK poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience STOP
START thus UNK `` my love is like a red , red rose '' and UNK `` the UNK UNK , UNK UNK of UNK '' although clearly UNK in content , hardly present ideas of the sort with which we are here concerned STOP
START on the other hand , UNK `` the UNK , salt , UNK sea '' , taken in its context , certainly does so STOP
START understanding a work of art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or UNK STOP
START thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to UNK a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject matter typical or UNK of its period STOP
START again , he may discover UNK within its UNK a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere and at other times in various ways STOP
START our understanding will very probably require both these UNK STOP
START very likely it will also include a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or `` belongs to '' some way of thought UNK as a `` school '' or an `` UNK '' , UNK complex or `` UNK '' of ideas occurring together with sufficient UNK to warrant identification STOP
START thus ideas like `` grace '' , `` salvation '' , and `` providence '' UNK together in traditional christianity STOP
START usually the work studied offers us a special or even an UNK UNK or treatment of the ideas in question , so that the student finds it necessary to distinguish carefully between the several expressions of an `` UNK '' or mode of thought STOP
START accordingly we may speak of the UNK peculiar to UNK poems or the type of UNK present in UNK `` UNK '' , and we may find that describing such UNK or such UNK and UNK each with other expressions of the same attitude or mode of thought is a difficult and UNK enterprise STOP
START after all , UNK is no `` orthodox '' or UNK UNK , and even his `` romantic '' UNK can be distinguished from that of his UNK STOP
START again , UNK attitude of UNK which colors his ideal of UNK is far from characteristic of a UNK UNK like UNK UNK , whose gentle UNK is almost christian , comparable to the patience expressed in UNK UNK on his own blindness STOP
START in recent years , we have come increasingly to recognize that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters of this history have to do with UNK or UNK aspects of literature and the arts , although these aspects should be studied in conjunction with the history of philosophy , of religion , and of the sciences STOP
START when these fields are UNK together , important patterns of relationship emerge UNK a vast community of UNK influence , a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions , primarily literary , religious , and philosophical , but frequently including contact with the fine arts and even , to some extent , with science STOP
START here we may observe that at least one modern philosophy of history is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives of the UNK research STOP
START let us quote once more from UNK : `` history is properly concerned with the actions of human beings regarded from the outside , an action is an event or series of events occurring in the physical world ; ; STOP
START regarded from the inside , it is the carrying into action of a certain thought the UNK business is to UNK to the inside of the actions with which he is dealing and UNK or rather UNK the thoughts which UNK them STOP
START it is a characteristic of thoughts that in UNK them we come , UNK UNK , to understand why they were thought '' STOP
START such an understanding , although it must seek to be sympathetic , is not a matter of intuition STOP
START `` history has this in common with every other science : that the historian is not allowed to claim any single piece of knowledge , except where he can justify his claim by UNK to himself in the first place , and UNK to any one else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration , the grounds upon which it is based STOP
START this is what was meant , above , by describing history as UNK STOP
START the knowledge in virtue of which a man is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal UNK about certain events '' STOP
START it is obvious that the historian who UNK to UNK the ideas that have UNK human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns , by no means a mere supplement or UNK of significant historical research STOP
START the student of ideas and their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of transition , which are at the same time patterns of transformation , whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another STOP
START let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought -- turning our attention from the UNK toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades STOP
START we may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its UNK in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the arts STOP
START finally we may note that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is at present widespread STOP
START no one will deny that such broad developments and UNK are of great UNK interest and the study of ideas in literature would be UNK incomplete without frequent reference to them STOP
START still , we must remember that we cannot construct and justify UNK of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special instances of influence moving between such areas as theology , philosophy , political thought , and literature STOP
START the actual moments of contact are UNK important STOP
START these moments are historical events in the lives of individual authors with which the student of comparative literature must be frequently concerned STOP
START perhaps the most powerful and most frequently UNK literary influence on the western world has been that of the old and new testament STOP
START certainly one of the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpreted the bible STOP
START this reading and the comments that it UNK constitute the influence STOP
START a contrast of the UNK reading of , let us say , UNK , john UNK , and thomas jefferson , all three of whom found in such study a real source of UNK , can tell us a great deal about these three men and the age that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression STOP
START in much the same way , we recognize the importance of UNK UNK with UNK and UNK , of UNK study of plato's UNK , and of UNK enthusiastic UNK of the writings of many UNK and UNK from plato to UNK and william UNK , through which so many abstract ideas were brought to the attention of english men of letters STOP
START we may also recognize cases in which the poets have influenced the UNK and even indirectly the scientists STOP
START english philosopher samuel UNK UNK to UNK and UNK is a recent interesting example , as also UNK understanding of the english UNK , chiefly UNK and UNK STOP
START UNK profound UNK for the insights of the greek UNK indicates a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth-century philosophy STOP
START again the student of UNK UNK will find a UNK , if to our minds UNK , anticipation of the theory of chance variations and the natural UNK of the UNK in UNK , who in turn seems to have UNK the concept from the philosopher UNK STOP
START here an important UNK is in order STOP
START we must avoid the notion , suggested to some people by examples such as those just mentioned , that ideas are `` units '' in some way comparable to UNK or UNK that can be passed UNK from one group of people to another or even , for that matter , from one individual to another STOP
START `` suppose you take UNK morning american at UNK a year '' , UNK proposed STOP
START `` you could come down to the office once a day , look over a few UNK , UNK an editorial , and then have the remainder of your time for your more serious literary UNK STOP
START if within one year you can make a success out of the american , you can practically name your own salary thereafter STOP
START of course , if you don't make the american a success , hearst will have no further use for you '' STOP
START the UNK watson decided that he would UNK living in new york , and the deal fell through STOP
START UNK luck was even UNK when he had a UNK with franklin UNK , a prominent california UNK and reform UNK , whom he asked for his support STOP
START lane was still burning because he had UNK UNK election as governor of california in UNK and laid his defeat to the UNK of UNK san francisco UNK STOP
START hearst UNK UNK for this , but the conversation , according to lane , ended on a UNK note STOP
START `` UNK '' , hearst said , `` if you ever wish anything that i can do , all you will have to do will be to send me a UNK asking , and it will be done '' STOP

START a bay state UNK said , `` UNK fight has been helped along greatly by the starting of his paper in boston '' STOP
START his UNK affected his UNK somewhat STOP

START the three volumes brought to the UNK a characteristic of trevelyan's prose which remained UNK through his later works -- a genius for describing military action with clarity and with authority STOP
START the confused UNK of UNK warfare , such as most of UNK campaigns were , was brought to life by trevelyan's UNK in some of the best passages in the books STOP
START his personal UNK with the scenes of action undoubtedly contributed much to the final result , but UNK alone would not have been enough without other qualities STOP
START military knowledge , love of detail , and a sure feeling for the UNK of action were the added UNK STOP
START but the garibaldi volumes were more than a romantic story STOP
START trevelyan contributed considerable new knowledge of the issues connected with his subject STOP
START the outstanding example was in garibaldi and the thousand , where he made use of UNK papers of lord john UNK and english UNK materials to reveal the motives which led the british government to permit garibaldi to cross the UNK of UNK STOP
START in looking back over the volumes , it is possible to find errors of interpretation , some of which were not so evident at the time of writing STOP
START thus trevelyan UNK the story which UNK victor UNK as UNK to abandon the famous UNK at the UNK of general UNK STOP
START later research has shown this part of the legend of the UNK UNK to be false STOP
START trevelyan UNK italian nationalism with little analysis , he is UNK critical of UNK and french policy , and he is more than generous in UNK british policy STOP
START but fifty years later the UNK still maintains a firm place in the list of standard works on the UNK of italy , a position UNK UNK by the UNK at the time of publication STOP
START trevelyan's UNK and the UNK revolution of UNK , his last major volume on an italian theme , was written in a minor key STOP
START published in UNK , it did not gain the popular UNK of the garibaldi volumes , probably because trevelyan felt less at home with UNK , the UNK lawyer , than with garibaldi , the UNK STOP
START the UNK of UNK politics UNK him , but the story of the revolution itself is told in UNK measures , with no UNK passages and only an occasional UNK of the part played by its leading figure STOP
START if it is not one of his best books , it can only be considered UNK when compared with his own garibaldi STOP
START already trevelyan had begun to parallel his nineteenth-century italian studies with several works on english figures of the same period STOP
START first the life of john bright appeared and seven years later lord UNK of the reform bill STOP
START of the two , the life of bright is UNK the better UNK STOP
START trevelyan centers too exclusively on bright , is UNK UNK of the views of UNK UNK and critics , and makes light of the genuine difficulties faced by UNK STOP
START yet he is right when he claims in his UNK that he drew the real features of the man , his UNK and UNK motives and his rugged UNK strength STOP
START in the story of bright and the corn law UNK , the UNK war , the american civil war , and the UNK struggle trevelyan reflects something of the moral power which UNK this independent man to exercise so UNK an influence over his fellow UNK for so long STOP
START because UNK speeches were so much a part of him , there are long and numerous UNK , which , far from making the UNK UNK , help to give us the feel of the man STOP
START associated in a sense with the manchester school through his mother's family , trevelyan UNK in this UNK something of its moral conviction and drive STOP
START nineteenth-century UNK , however , seem somehow to have gone out of fashion and the bright book has never been particularly popular STOP
START the UNK of lord UNK is strictly speaking not a UNK at all STOP
START it is a UNK history of the `` tory reaction '' which UNK the reform bill of UNK , and it uses the figure of UNK to give some unity to the narrative STOP
START the volume is a piece of UNK special UNK , written with the heat -- and often with the wisdom , it must be said -- of a liberal UNK the UNK of UNK from UNK to UNK STOP
START UNK , trevelyan enjoyed writing the work STOP
START the theme of UNK summer coming after a long winter of UNK and UNK was , he has told us , UNK to his artistic sense STOP
START and UNK UNK background was close to trevelyan's own STOP
START but his concentration on UNK and his UNK assessment of their actions fail to UNK the political UNK of a long generation UNK by world-wide war and confronted with the problem of adjustment to an UNK industrial and social transformation STOP
START some historians have found his point of view not to their taste , others have complained that he makes the tory tradition appear `` UNK rather than UNK '' , while a sympathetic critic has remarked that the `` UNK UNK of social UNK and political activity of which , at times , UNK are the UNK UNK is not a field for the exercise of his talents '' STOP

START britain in the nineteenth century is a UNK designed `` to give the sense of continuous growth , to show how economic led to social , and social to political change , how the political events UNK on the economic and social , and how new thoughts and new ideals accompanied or directed the whole complicated process '' STOP
START the plan is UNK UNK for the period up to UNK STOP
START more UNK than in the study of UNK and despite his liberal UNK , trevelyan UNK sketches the england of UNK revolution days , UNK the stresses and UNK of the revolutionary period in rich colors , and brings developments leading to the reform bill into sharp and clear focus STOP
START his technique is UNK UNK STOP
START by what one reader called a `` series of UNK views '' , he UNK one period into another and gives a sense of continuous growth STOP
START but after UNK , the narrative tends to lose its balanced , UNK quality and to become a UNK of UNK , often UNK by any single UNK STOP
START economic analysis was never trevelyan's strong point and the england of the industrial transformation UNK out for economic analysis STOP
START yet after UNK , the UNK of economic and social and political affairs become UNK and the narrative becomes largely a conventional political account STOP
START finally , the period after UNK receives little attention and that quite UNK STOP
START yet britain in the nineteenth century became the UNK UNK of beginning students of history , went through edition after edition , and continues to be UNK up to the very present STOP
START its success is a tribute , above all , to trevelyan's UNK as a literary UNK STOP
START in UNK trevelyan traveled to the united states , where he delivered the UNK UNK at harvard university STOP
START these UNK formed the UNK of a general survey of english development which took form UNK as a history of england STOP
START in short order , the general history became his most popular work and has remained , aside from his later social history , the work most widely UNK by the public STOP
START the history of england has often been compared with UNK short history STOP
START like green , trevelyan aimed to write a history not of `` english UNK or english UNK '' , but of the english people STOP
START the result was fortunate STOP
START the history takes too much for granted to serve as a text for other than english UNK , and like britain in the nineteenth century it UNK badly as it goes beyond UNK STOP
START trevelyan's UNK into contemporary history were rarely happy ones STOP
START but as a UNK , UNK interpretation of the broad UNK of english development it is UNK STOP
START living pictures of the early UNK , country life in UNK and UNK times , the impact of the industrial revolution compete with sensitive surveys of language and literature , the common law , UNK development STOP
START the strength of the history is also its weakness STOP
START trevelyan is UNK sure of the UNK of english institutions and character over those of other peoples STOP
START his nationalism was not a new characteristic , but its UNK , even its UNK , is more obvious in a book that UNK over the long reach of english history STOP
START and yet the elements which capture his liberal and UNK imagination are those which make the english story worth telling and worth UNK STOP
START UNK and UNK , social justice and civil liberty , are today too often in short supply for one to be UNK critical of trevelyan's emphasis on their central place in the english tradition STOP
START like most major works of synthesis , the history of england is informed by the positive views of a UNK mind , and this is surely a major work STOP
START four years after the publication of the history of england , the first volume of trevelyan's queen UNK UNK appeared STOP
START by now he had become UNK professor of modern history at cambridge and had been UNK by the award of the order of merit STOP
START his academic duties had little evident effect on his UNK UNK STOP
START UNK was followed in rapid succession by UNK and the union with UNK and by the peace and the protestant succession , the three forming together a detailed picture of england under queen UNK STOP
START like his volume on UNK , the work was accompanied by the publication of a selected group of documents , in this case UNK of the history of queen UNK UNK down to UNK STOP
START trevelyan was at least in part attracted to the period by an almost unconscious desire to take up the story where UNK history of england had broken off STOP
START in addition , he believed in the `` dramatic unity and UNK of the period from UNK , lying between the UNK and UNK UNK with a special UNK of its own '' STOP
START he saw the age as one in which britain `` settled her free constitution '' and UNK her modern place in the world STOP
START to most observers , there is little doubt that he placed an artificial UNK UNK of unity upon the years of UNK UNK which in reality existed only in the pages of his history STOP
START of the three volumes , UNK is easily the best STOP
START in four opening chapters UNK of UNK famous third chapter , trevelyan surveys the state of england at the opening of the eighteenth century STOP
START his delightful picture of society and institutions is filled with warm detail that brings the period UNK to life STOP
START he tends to UNK -- or perhaps to view UNK -- the UNK and the violence of the age , so that there is an UNK quality in these pages which UNK over some of its sharp reality STOP
START yet as an UNK of time past , there are few such successful UNK in english historical literature STOP
START once the scene is set , trevelyan UNK UNK up the UNK story until it reaches its climax in the dramatic victory of UNK and UNK of UNK at UNK STOP
START the account of the battle is , next to his UNK of UNK campaigns , trevelyan's outstanding military narrative STOP
START the scene is UNK in sharp detail , the military problems UNK explained , and the excitement and importance of the battle made evident STOP
START if only for this UNK UNK of military history , UNK is likely to be read and UNK long after newer UNK have perhaps altered our picture of the UNK wars STOP
START UNK and the union with UNK has fewer high spots than UNK and much less of its dramatic unity STOP
START yet in several chapters on UNK in the eighteenth century , trevelyan UNK UNK with the UNK confusion of UNK politics against a vivid background of UNK religion , customs , and traditions STOP
START i stood on a table , surrounded by hundreds of UNK young faces STOP
START questions came to me from all sides about my world UNK activities STOP
START after making a short statement about human rights , and the freedom to travel , i told them i would be going to the kehl bridge the next morning in order to cross the UNK into germany STOP
START `` may we come with you '' ? ? STOP
START called out a dozen young UNK STOP
START `` well , i might not get that far '' , i told them , `` as actually i have no papers to enter germany and , as a matter of fact , no permit to return to france once i leave '' STOP
START that was all they needed STOP
START they would UNK me STOP
START we would all meet at ten o'clock at the kehl bridge , five miles from UNK , and march UNK across into germany STOP
START there was only one UNK : the small town of kehl , on the other side of the UNK , was still under french jurisdiction STOP
START the real UNK frontier was beyond the UNK limits STOP
START in fact , all persons were permitted to cross the UNK into kehl , there being no UNK UNK on the west side of the river STOP
START that evening , as i learned later , the students , UNK that spontaneous UNK in action known only to university students , UNK out onto the streets of UNK , UNK empty UNK , UNK up store UNK , and UNK UNK , `` garry davis to power '' ! ! STOP
START as i got off the UNK at kehl bridge the next morning , i was met by what looked like UNK students , some of whom were carrying UNK apparently for the coming `` battle '' with the police STOP
START UNK by this display of weapons , i looked toward the bridge and there saw , UNK across the near side , a UNK of UNK , their UNK forming a UNK before which stood several french officers in uniform and a small UNK man in a brown UNK STOP
START `` listen please '' , i called to the students in french STOP
START `` i UNK you most UNK for being here STOP
START this is full evidence of your support for my principles STOP
START these principles , however , will not be served by violence in any form STOP
START if they are right , they will UNK of and by themselves STOP
START i ask you all to support me in this STOP
START if one finger is raised against the authorities , all our moral power will UNK STOP
START your UNK in this respect will be the only witness to your understanding of what i am saying STOP
START i have full confidence in you STOP
START now , UNK go '' STOP
START i UNK up to the waiting officials , the students UNK behind me STOP
START as usual , the press UNK were on hand STOP
START the UNK man stopped me three UNK from the UNK UNK , and asked me in french if i had papers to leave france STOP
START i replied in the UNK , taking out my recently acquired UNK UNK et de voyage , on which was UNK a permission to leave france STOP
START he examined it carefully , UNK it back and said , `` UNK UNK , you may leave france '' STOP
START i took one step UNK STOP
START one of the UNK officers stepped in my way , demanding to know whether i had permission to enter germany STOP
START `` no , i have no permission to enter germany '' , i told him STOP
START `` UNK , you may go no farther '' , he said UNK STOP
START `` is this then the frontier '' ? ? STOP
START i asked him STOP
START `` yes '' STOP
START at this , the students let out a UNK , knowing full well the actual frontier was beyond the town of kehl STOP
START `` but i have no permission to UNK france , and i have just left '' , i told him STOP
START `` i must then be standing on the line between france and germany '' STOP
START the UNK man stepped forward STOP
START `` line ? ? STOP
START line ? ? STOP
START but there is no line between france and germany , that is , no actual line STOP
START i mean '' STOP
START `` no line '' ? ? STOP
START i asked STOP
START `` but if there is no line , how can there be two countries ? ? STOP
START you have just given me permission to leave france , which i did STOP
START i have UNK STOP
START and as you know , i have no permission to UNK france once out STOP
START now i learn i cannot enter germany STOP
START obviously i'm UNK on the line between the two countries '' STOP
START the students were UNK UNK at this piece of UNK , and even the UNK were trying hard not to smile STOP
START `` UNK UNK '' , the interior ministry man UNK , `` you may come back to UNK , now , if you wish '' STOP
START `` oh ? ? STOP
START then will you give me a UNK to UNK france '' ? ? STOP
START `` UNK ? ? STOP
START but there is no question of a UNK STOP
START you are still in france '' STOP
START `` UNK , then please tell me where the frontier is because this gentleman here '' -- i indicated the french occupation officer -- `` UNK me that germany is just on the other side of him '' STOP
START the interior man looked UNK at his french UNK STOP
START from the crowd were coming UNK of `` he's right '' ! ! STOP
START `` there must be a line '' ! ! STOP
START and `` UNK , garry , continue '' ! ! STOP
START seeing their UNK , i said , `` well , until i have permission to enter germany , or a UNK to UNK france , i shall be obliged to remain here on the line between two countries '' , UNK i moved to the side of the road , UNK my UNK against the small UNK on the sidewalk , sat down , took out my UNK , and began UNK the above conversation STOP
START the reporters were UNK the interior man and the french officer , both of whom remained UNK as to what action , if any , would be taken in my regard STOP
START finally they went off to file their stories , after the UNK had taken pictures of my latest UNK STOP
START the students UNK around asking questions , UNK me on the back , and generally being friendly STOP
START `` but what will you do this evening , UNK '' ? ? STOP
START asked a young UNK UNK STOP
START `` it will be very cold '' STOP
START `` i don't know '' , i told him , `` except that i will be here '' STOP
START `` i shall see about getting you a UNK '' , he said STOP
START `` i have a small sports shop in UNK '' STOP
START that would be a great help , i told him , UNK him for his UNK STOP
START a special guard was UNK at my end of the bridge to make sure i didn't cross , the UNK of the situation being revealed fully in that everyone else -- men , women , and children , dogs , UNK , horses , cars , UNK , baby UNK -- could cross kehl bridge into kehl without UNK STOP
START the day passed UNK enough , with a constant stream of visitors , some UNK only to say UNK , others getting into serious UNK , such as one UNK UNK , a UNK UNK from UNK who wrote an article for the UNK UNK in highly sympathetic terms STOP
START some students from the university returned around six with a large UNK containing enough hot UNK to last me a week STOP
START a UNK food UNK had been arranged , they told me , which would supply me with the necessities as long as i remained at the bridge STOP
START a little later , the sports shop man returned with a small UNK UNK STOP
START one of the girl students , sitting by while i UNK the thick UNK , asked me if i had a sleeping bag STOP
START when i informed her that i didn't , she said she would UNK her UNK and bring it to me later that evening STOP
START `` you do not know me '' , she said in good english , `` but my mother was your UNK in philadelphia when you were a child '' STOP
START her name was UNK peter STOP
START i was UNK to make that personal contact in such trying and unusual circumstances STOP
START the peter family proved wonderful and helpful friends in the following days , UNK , little UNK , and UNK , who UNK UNK me his sleeping bag for my `` watch on the UNK '' STOP
START UNK a line from the bridge to a small field directly to the side , i UNK the UNK that evening on the UNK `` line '' , UNK a small UNK around it as best i could with a UNK UNK UNK by a neighborhood child STOP
START the wind from the UNK was UNK and UNK , UNK a fire for UNK STOP
START after UNK around a bit in the open area , i came across what proved to be UNK UNK which UNK and burned UNK , giving off vast UNK of smoke into the UNK sky STOP
START each evening the students appeared with the UNK UNK and several UNK UNK , UNK usually being among them STOP
START i had advised friends to write me to `` no man's land , pont kehl , between UNK and kehl , UNK '' STOP
START sure enough , mail began UNK in , delivered by a UNK , highly UNK french UNK who informed me there had been quite a debate at the post office as to whether that address would be recognized STOP
START on christmas eve , students brought out two small christmas trees which i placed on either side of the UNK STOP
START as the field on which my UNK was UNK was a favorite natural UNK for the UNK of the neighborhood , i had made many friends among them , taking part in their UNK games and trying UNK to UNK UNK UNK tales into an UNK french as we gathered around the fire in front of the UNK STOP
START to my great surprise and delight , when they saw the two trees they went UNK off , returning shortly with UNK from their own trees STOP
START it was a UNK if somewhat UNK christmas for me that year STOP
START in the mail were UNK to speak at the universities of UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START twenty thousand world citizens at UNK had signed a UNK UNK me to visit their town STOP
START when UNK was approached by a world citizen UNK to find out his UNK of my case , he gave them his personal approval of my entry , saying that all men UNK peace should be UNK into germany STOP
START the special guard , however , was still UNK on kehl bridge STOP
START as it began UNK at around eight o'clock on december UNK , i retired into my UNK early , somewhat tired and discouraged , my body UNK UNK because of the continued exposure STOP
START no matter how large the fire , i couldn't seem to UNK off the UNK that day STOP
START `` oh , UNK , are you there '' ? ? STOP
START a voice UNK in to me above the UNK of the rain shortly after i had fallen into a UNK sleep STOP
START `` who is it '' ? ? STOP
START `` UNK from the council of europe , british UNK STOP
START may we have a word with you '' ? ? STOP
START `` i'm UNK STOP
START i've had a trying day and i just can't make it out again '' , i told them STOP
START i heard nothing more STOP
START later i learned that sir UNK UNK had expressed a desire to see me , hence their trip to `` no man's land '' STOP
START on the evening of december UNK , UNK noticed my UNK look and UNK voice STOP
START she UNK me to see a doctor , and when i refused , brought one out to see me STOP
START he advised immediate UNK STOP
START i wouldn't hear of it because it meant giving up the `` line '' , though i realized i was in poor shape physically STOP
START UNK , UNK my UNK , assured me that the hospital expense would be taken care of by a leading merchant in UNK whom she had already approached STOP
START `` no , it's not that '' , i told her STOP
START `` you see , once i UNK the position i've already established here , i couldn't UNK it without UNK the UNK of it '' STOP
START at that moment , up walked a tall young man with glasses who announced himself as a world citizen from UNK , UNK STOP
START without UNK , UNK asked him , `` if you are a world citizen , will you take garry UNK place in his UNK while he goes to the hospital '' ? ? STOP
START `` but of course , with pleasure '' , he replied STOP
START UNK looked at me STOP
START i looked from her to him STOP
START `` what is your name '' ? ? STOP
START i asked him STOP
START `` UNK UNK '' STOP
START `` UNK '' , i said STOP
START `` you have just UNK for the ' UNK campaign ' '' STOP
START UNK UNK up , ran to him and gave him a little UNK STOP
START `` i am so happy STOP
START now come , garry , we must go quickly STOP
START there is a police car outside STOP
START maybe they will take us '' STOP
START such were the UNK of the situation that the very police assigned to check up on me were UNK into driving me to the UNK hospital while world citizen UNK UNK UNK UNK from the `` line '' ! ! STOP
START he remembered every detail of his UNK movements but nothing of the final , desperate UNK to come to UNK with the enemy STOP
START when the victory UNK went up this officer found himself still mounted , with his horse pressed UNK against UNK UNK UNK in a UNK group of UNK STOP
START his UNK was gone , the tears were UNK from his eyes STOP
START he never knew how he got there STOP
START six UNK minutes in an individual's life left no memory STOP
START eight hundred and UNK UNK UNK within their works and a thousand more were captured or UNK themselves that night and the next day STOP
START eight field guns were captured in position STOP
START seven battle UNK and fourteen UNK UNK were sent to UNK headquarters STOP
START it was the only UNK assault upon infantry and UNK behind UNK successfully made by either side during the atlanta campaign STOP
START the UNK regiment of ohio volunteers lost one-third of its numbers within a few minutes , among them being several men whose time of service had UNK but who had UNK to advance with their regiment STOP
START the UNK regiment of ohio volunteers , one of the UNK in UNK first division during UNK command , suffered its greatest loss of the war in this action STOP
START a popular belief grew up after the war that the only time during the civil war that thomas ever put his horse to a UNK was when he went to UNK up UNK for this assault STOP
START sherman was responsible for the story when he said in his UNK that this was the only time he could recall seeing thomas ride so fast STOP
START while UNK UNK back led him to UNK his mount from its most violent UNK he moved quickly enough when he had to STOP
START it is not in the record , but he must have UNK his horse at UNK tree UNK when he brought up UNK guns to save UNK UNK line STOP
START while the final combat of the campaign was being worked out at UNK , thomas , on UNK instructions , ordered UNK , now UNK the twentieth corps , to make an effort to occupy atlanta if he could do so without UNK his UNK to a UNK STOP
START the UNK must have been sent after UNK on september 1 STOP
START UNK made his UNK the next morning , found the town empty , accepted the surrender of the UNK and occupied the city a little before UNK STOP
START on the morning of september 2 the fourth corps and the armies of the tennessee and the ohio followed the line of UNK UNK STOP
START about UNK they came up with the enemy two miles from UNK station and UNK STOP
START the fourth corps UNK and carried a small portion of the enemy works but could not hold possession of the gain for want of cooperation from the balance of the line STOP
START that night a note written in UNK hand and dated from inside the captured city came to sherman stating that the twentieth corps was in possession of atlanta STOP
START before making the news public sherman sent an officer with the note to thomas STOP
START in a short time the officer returned and thomas followed on his UNK STOP
START the UNK thomas UNK the note and then , making up his mind that it was genuine , UNK his fingers , UNK and almost UNK in his UNK STOP
START the next day sherman issued his orders ending the campaign and pulled his armies back to atlanta STOP
START the measure of combat efficiency in an UNK campaign is a matter of personal choice STOP
START sherman laid great store by place UNK STOP
START UNK refused to notice anything except captured guns and colors STOP
START by both standards thomas had the right to be proud STOP
START thomas UNK his men for their UNK of purpose , UNK endurance , UNK UNK , brilliant UNK and high qualities in battle STOP
START sherman felt that his own part in the campaign was UNK and well UNK but that the UNK of a part of his army UNK him of the larger fruits of victory STOP
START he supposed the military world would UNK of his UNK STOP
START whatever the military world thought , the political world approved it UNK STOP
START for some time , UNK in some northern quarters had been displayed in two ways -- an UNK for peace and a UNK with lincoln STOP
START proposals were in the air for a year's UNK STOP
START lincoln was sure that he would not be UNK STOP
START in the UNK of this UNK , at UNK UNK september 2 , UNK UNK to UNK , `` general sherman has taken atlanta '' , UNK the talk of a UNK peace and UNK lincoln into the white house STOP
START to the UNK no victory could have been more complete STOP
START official UNK UNK upon sherman and his army STOP
START lincoln mentioned their distinguished ability , courage and UNK STOP
START he felt that this campaign would be famous in the UNK of war STOP
START grant called it UNK , UNK and brilliant STOP
START UNK described it as the most brilliant of the war STOP
START actually the atlanta campaign was a military failure STOP
START next best to destroying an army is to UNK it of its freedom of action STOP
START sherman had accomplished this much of his job and then UNK UNK it by his UNK UNK from UNK to atlanta STOP
START but , so far as its territorial objectives were concerned , the campaign was successful STOP
START within the narrow frame of military tactics , too , the experts agree that the campaign was brilliant STOP
START in seventeen weeks the military front was driven UNK more than 100 miles STOP
START there was a battle on an average of once every three weeks STOP
START the UNK was almost constant STOP
START in the summary of the principal events of the campaign UNK from the official records there are only ten days which show no fighting STOP
START the UNK in the army of the UNK were UNK , while for all three armies they were UNK STOP
START men were killed in their camps , at their meals and in their sleep STOP
START rifle fire often kept the opposing UNK from UNK their pieces STOP
START modern warfare was born in this campaign -- UNK , UNK , UNK UNK , land mines , extended order , UNK UNK , UNK , UNK cars , night UNK , UNK , UNK in trees , UNK UNK and UNK , which were the UNK of UNK wire , trip UNK to UNK a cavalry charge , which UNK the mine trap , and the general use of UNK STOP
START the use of map UNK was begun when the senior officers began to select UNK points by UNK a spot as `` near the letter o in the word mountain '' STOP
START a few weeks later the maps were being divided into squares and a position was described as being `` about lots UNK , UNK and UNK with UNK forward as far as UNK '' STOP
START this system was dependent upon identical maps and thomas supplied them from a mobile UNK press STOP
START orders of the day began to specify the standard map for the movement STOP
START sherman proved that a UNK base could be movable and the most brilliant feature of the atlanta campaign was the rapid UNK of the UNK STOP
START to the UNK it seemed as if sherman carried UNK and bridges in his UNK STOP
START the UNK of UNK UNK often UNK out the UNK of the UNK fire STOP
START as always , the UNK worked out new and better tactics , but there was UNK in the way the field commands adopted these methods and in the way the army UNK incorporated them into their military thinking STOP
START the UNK , UNK , UNK thinking of the UNK military brain was not evident in UNK armies STOP
START sherman could never be accused of UNK too long with the old STOP
START one of UNK most serious UNK , however , was his UNK of his cavalry STOP
START he never saw that it was a complement to his infantry and not a substitute for it STOP
START then , in some way , this lack of faith in the cavalry became mixed up in his mind with the UNK effect of wagon UNK and was UNK into a UNK STOP
START a horse needed twenty pounds of food a day but the UNK got along with two pounds STOP
START the UNK required eleven times more than the UNK STOP
START so sherman tried a UNK STOP
START he would ship by UNK five pounds per day per animal and the other fifteen pounds that were needed could be picked up off the country STOP
START it failed to work STOP
START already UNK by the UNK UNK , the quality of UNK UNK ran UNK as the campaign UNK STOP
START every recorded request by thomas for a delay in a UNK movement or an advance was to gain time to take care of his horses STOP
START well led , properly organized cavalry , in its UNK role to infantry , had four functions STOP
START first , it could locate the enemy infantry , learn what they were doing , and hold them until the heavy foot columns could come up and take over STOP
START second , it could screen its own infantry from the sight of the enemy STOP
START third , it could UNK at all times , and destroy when possible , the enemy communications STOP
START it could reach key UNK points UNK than infantry and destroy them or hold them as the case might be for the foot soldier STOP
START its UNK role was to pursue and UNK a UNK enemy but this chance never came in the atlanta campaign STOP
START thomas tried hard to have his cavalry ready for the test it was to meet , but his plans were UNK when it was forced into a campaign without optimum UNK and with its commander UNK from it STOP
START sherman knew the uses of cavalry as well as thomas but he UNK a moving base with infantry wings instead of cavalry wings STOP
START his conception proved UNK but UNK and it UNK his enemy to make clean , UNK , well organized UNK with small UNK losses STOP
START sherman insisted that cavalry could not successfully break up hostile UNK , yet UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK UNK cut UNK of the UNK lines he had to break and sherman lived in UNK fear of what UNK might do to his communications STOP
START when UNK pushed UNK through UNK UNK gap in a UNK decisive movement , the only cavalry in his van was the UNK illinois mounted infantry , UNK inadequate for its role STOP
START it UNK on infantry where no infantry should have been and UNK aggressive UNK UNK out , UNK by fears of the unknown STOP
START a proper cavalry command in his front would have developed the fact that he had run into one division of UNK army of the mississippi moving up from the direction of mobile to join UNK at UNK STOP
START from the night of august 30 to the morning of september 2 there was no union cavalry east of the UNK UNK to UNK to sherman that he was UNK the greatest opportunity of his career STOP
START a great part of the time , UNK infantry never knew the location of the enemy line STOP
START at such times thomas UNK when and where a UNK would strike him STOP
START it was the hard way to fight a war but thomas did it without making any UNK UNK STOP
START heat during the atlanta campaign , coupled with UNK clothing , caused individual UNK that was UNK by a lack of opportunity to UNK and shift into clean clothing STOP
START to UNK the UNK and UNK UNK , the men got into the water whenever they could and since each UNK stream was generally the UNK line between the armies the UNK declared a private UNK while the men went swimming STOP
START UNK believed that sherman put his naked engineers into the swimming parties to locate the various UNK STOP
START lieutenant colonel james UNK , who UNK the first UNK of UNK first cavalry division , was ordered across one of these UNK STOP
START the water was deep and UNK took his UNK across naked -- except for guns , UNK UNK and UNK STOP
START they UNK their horses through the deep water with their UNK UNK , drove the UNK out of their rifle UNK and captured four men STOP
START most of the UNK got away since they could make better time through the UNK brush than their naked UNK STOP
START rank was becoming an UNK issue in all three of UNK armies STOP
START UNK recommendations from army UNK were passed over in favor of political UNK from civil life STOP
START in one of the very few letters in which he ever complained of UNK , thompson told UNK of his distress at having had to leave london before this new friendship had developed further : `` STOP
START that was a very absurd and UNK situation in which i was placed by UNK curious methods of handling me STOP
START he never let me know that my visit was about to UNK until the actual morning i was to leave for UNK STOP
START the result was that i found myself in the UNK position of having made a formal UNK by letter for the next week , only two days before my UNK from london STOP
START UNK both women knew my position and if anyone suffered in their opinion it was not i '' STOP
START it need hardly be remarked that thompson was not generally known for his UNK about keeping his social UNK , which makes his UNK in this letter all the more significant STOP
START when thompson and her daughter began a correspondence which included UNK UNK from UNK , UNK felt a proper UNK UNK STOP
START some , she knew , looked upon thompson almost as a UNK , but others read in `` the UNK of heaven '' what they took to be the UNK of a great UNK , who , like UNK UNK , had -- as one UNK writer later put it -- thrown himself `` on the UNK wave of every passion '' STOP
START consequently , on october 31 , UNK , UNK wrote to thompson , quite against her UNK wishes , asking him not to `` UNK a correspondence which i believe has been dropped for some weeks '' STOP
START UNK was UNK at a UNK , and her mother felt that , as thompson himself seems to have suggested , she might eventually stay there STOP
START this prospect did not please UNK any more than did the possibility that her daughter might UNK a UNK , but she used it to suggest to thompson that , `` it is not in her nature to love you '' STOP
START for his part , thompson had explained in a previous letter that there would be nothing but an UNK friendship between UNK and himself STOP
START at no time does he seem to have proposed marriage , and UNK was evidently UNK between a concern for her UNK emotions and the desire to believe that the friendship might be continued without UNK to her reputation STOP
START in any case , she told thompson that she saw no reason why he might not see UNK again , `` now that this frank explanation has been made & no one can UNK '' STOP
START she ended her letter with the assurance that she considered his friendship for her daughter and herself to be an honor , from which she could not part `` without still more pain '' STOP
START after thompson came to london to live , he received a letter from UNK , which was dated february 8 , UNK STOP
START she UNK what she described as the `` UNK & UNK '' check to their friendship and said that she felt that they understood one another perfectly STOP
START this letter concluded with an UNK : `` STOP
START i am a great deal at the little children's hospital STOP
START UNK knows the way STOP
START i know you are very busy now , you are writing a great deal & your book is coming out , isn't it ? ? STOP
START but if you are able & care to come , you know how UNK i shall be STOP
START ever UNK UNK , STOP
START UNK UNK king '' the UNK was accepted and other letters followed , in which she spoke of her concern for his health and her delight in seeing him so much at home among the UNK children she served STOP
START it is difficult to say what thompson expected would come of their relationship , which had begun so soon after his emotions had been UNK by UNK UNK , but when UNK wrote on april 11 , 1900 , to tell him that she was to be married to the UNK UNK , the UNK of UNK in UNK , the news evidently helped to UNK his UNK over the failure of his hopes for a new volume of verse STOP
START in a letter to UNK , which was written in june , less than a month before UNK UNK , he was highly UNK in his despair and once again announced his intention of returning to the life of the streets : `` STOP
START a week in UNK , and without means to pay , i must go , it is the only right thing STOP
START perhaps UNK would do me the UNK UNK to keep my own copy of the first edition of my first book , with all its UNK of her and the dear ones STOP
START last , not least , there are some poems which UNK sent me ( UNK to herself ) when i was preparing a fresh volume , asking me to include them STOP
START the terrible UNK of the new year put an end to that project STOP
START i wish you would return them to her STOP
START i have not the heart STOP
START i never had the courage to look at them , when my UNK volume became UNK , UNK they were poor , until now when i was obliged to do so STOP
START o my genius , young and UNK , you would UNK , -- when i wrote them ; ; STOP
START and now ! ! STOP
START what has it all come to ? ? STOP
START all chance of UNK my destiny is over STOP
START i want you to be UNK to these UNK poems , dear UNK , now i am gone ; ; STOP
START and UNK them on the world when their time comes STOP
START for them a box will be UNK enough STOP
START UNK cannot mind your seeing them now ; ; STOP
START since my silence must have ended when i gave the UNK volume to you STOP
START i ask you to do me the last UNK of reading them by 8 UNK evening , about which time i shall come to say my sad UNK STOP
START if you don't think much of them , tell me the UNK truth STOP
START if otherwise , you will give me a pleasure STOP
START o UNK ! ! STOP
START it is strange ; ; STOP
START but this -- yes , terrible step i am about to take is UNK with an UNK joy by the UNK hope that here , in these poems , is UNK -- or at least some measure of beauty , which i did not know of '' STOP
START thompson , of course , was persuaded not to take the `` terrible step '' ; ; STOP
START UNK once again paid his UNK and it was UNK , rather than thompson , whose life was soon ended , for she died in UNK in april , UNK , in the first year of her marriage STOP
START the `` UNK poems '' mentioned in the letter to UNK UNK a group of five UNK , which were published in the UNK edition of UNK works under the heading `` UNK UNK '' , plus certain other completed pieces and rough UNK gathered together in one of the familiar exercise books STOP
START the publication of father UNK the man has wings has made more of the group available in UNK so that a general picture of what it contained can now be had without difficulty STOP
START some of the poems express a UNK of joy in a newly discovered love ; ; STOP
START others suggest its coming loss or describe the UNK feelings when he UNK of a final separation STOP
START the somewhat UNK love story which these poems suggest cannot UNK the fact that undoubtedly they have more than a little of UNK UNK STOP
START when they were first written , there was evidently no thought of their being published , and those which refer to the UNK love for UNK particularly have the ring of truth STOP
START in `` my UNK young virgin date '' , for example , thompson wrote : `` UNK , she that had my UNK young virgin date not now , UNK , that UNK singular she , i UNK hold , though UNK from her once state , than others in their best UNK STOP
START my own UNK hand has rent the ancient bond , and thereof shall the ending not have end : but not for me , that loved her , to be UNK lightly to please me with a newer friend then hold it more than UNK song , that i affirm to thee , with heart of pride , i knew not what did to a friend belong till i stood up , true friend , by thy true side ; ; STOP
START whose absence UNK comfort is , by far , than UNK of other women are '' ! ! STOP
START taking into account UNK capacity for UNK and the possibility of a wish to identify his own life with the UNK of other poets who had known unhappy UNK , there can be no doubt about his genuine emotion for UNK king STOP
START that she was affected by his UNK seems obvious , but since she was evidently a UNK young woman -- as well as an UNK and sympathetic type -- it would seem that for her the word friendship had a far less intense emotional significance than that which thompson gave it STOP
START from the UNK , she must have realized that marriage with him was out of the question , and although she was UNK by the `` UNK '' interference , it seems probable that she did agree with her mother's suggestion that the poet was `` perhaps '' a man `` most UNK to live & die UNK , & in the love only of the highest UNK '' STOP
START the poems which were UNK to her , while they are far more UNK than those of `` love in UNK UNK '' , show no great technical advance over those of the `` narrow UNK '' group and are , if anything , somewhat more UNK STOP
START their interest remains chiefly UNK , for they throw some light on the UNK despair which UNK thompson in the spring and early summer of 1900 STOP
START whether or not UNK is correct in UNK that UNK UNK of the UNK habit also dates from this period is , of course , a matter of UNK STOP
START UNK simply states , without offering any supporting evidence , that `` after he returned to london , he resumed his UNK of UNK , and continued this right up to his death '' STOP
START there is every reason to recognize that in the very last years of his life , as we shall see , thompson did take the drug in carefully UNK UNK to ease the UNK of his UNK , but the exact date at which this began has never been determined STOP
START if , as UNK says , `` nearly all his poetry was produced when he was not taking UNK '' , there may be some reason to doubt that he was under its influence in the period from UNK to 1900 when he was writing the poems to UNK king and making plans for another book of verse STOP
START in any event , the critical productivity of that time is UNK proof that if he was taking UNK , it was never in command of him to the extent that it had been during his UNK years STOP
START UNK remedy for UNK UNK UNK was typically practical STOP
START he simply found more work for him to do , and the articles and UNK continued without an evident break STOP
START 3 , STOP
START as a UNK , thompson generally displayed a UNK attitude STOP
START that he read some of the books assigned to him with a studied UNK is evident from his notes , which are often so full that they provide an UNK basis for the identification of UNK that were printed without his UNK STOP
START on the basis of this careful reading , thompson frequently gave a clear , complete , and interesting description of a prose work or chose effective UNK to illustrate his discussions of poetry STOP
START he was seldom an UNK critic , and his UNK generally followed a systematic pattern : a description of what the work contained , a treatment of the things that had especially interested him in it , and , wherever possible , a UNK of whatever artistic UNK and UNK he might have found STOP
START it was , of course , in this drawing of the balance sheet of judgment that he most clearly displayed his desire to do full justice to an author STOP
START UNK UNK the testament of an empire builder , for example , thompson found that there was `` too much UNK UNK '' STOP
START poetry , he said , must be `` UNK '' : it must not UNK to argue like a `` UNK UNK '' STOP
START yet UNK impressed him as a poet capable of `` sustained power , passion , or beauty '' , and he cited specific passages to illustrate not only these qualities but UNK command of UNK as well STOP
START similarly , he wrote that UNK UNK had a `` too UNK manner '' as well as a lack of `` inevitable UNK in UNK '' STOP
START but he UNK UNK `` subtle UNK '' and UNK in the UNK by which divine love becomes the most `` fatal '' UNK in `` love the UNK '' STOP
START of course , there were books about which nothing good could be said STOP
START understanding , as he did , the difficulty of the art of poetry , and UNK that the `` only technical criticism worth having in poetry is that of poets '' , he felt obliged to insist upon his duty to be hard to please when it came to the review of a book of verse STOP
START as he had done on his first UNK UNK a year and a half before , lewis UNK UNK through red russia to UNK STOP
START UNK he pushed farther south than he had ever been before into UNK and UNK UNK or the UNK STOP
START there , along the east bank of the southern UNK , opposite the UNK of UNK a few miles north of the black sea , he arrived at general headquarters of the russian army STOP
START by june 19 , UNK , he had presented himself to its commander in chief , the governor of the southern UNK , the director of the war college -- the prince STOP
START UNK first war against the grand UNK had ended in UNK with a peace UNK quite favorable to her STOP

START through most of UNK operations on both sides had been UNK ; ; STOP
START those of UNK were going to prove decisive , though many of their details are UNK STOP
START to UNK what her navy had won , the UNK was fortunate that , for the first time in russian history , her land forces enjoyed absolute unity of command under her favorite UNK STOP

START during a UNK of slightly more than three months UNK UNK could see action on both elements STOP
START as his second in command the prince had UNK UNK , UNK ambassador to poland STOP
START UNK , who had a rather narrow face , UNK nose , high UNK , and UNK UNK , looked like a UNK UNK STOP
START some people thought he lacked both ability and character , but most agreed that he was UNK in appearance and , for a russian , UNK STOP
START the UNK came to know UNK quite well STOP
START at general headquarters the UNK in turn got to know others STOP
START there was the UNK , UNK , a capable UNK whose father had been a UNK but who had UNK his way up the UNK of UNK and UNK favor till he was now a UNK ( and would one day be the UNK designated to do in UNK paul 1 , , after traveling all the way to UNK to UNK just the right UNK ) STOP
START then there were the distinguished foreign volunteers STOP

START from UNK came the young UNK de UNK , an officer in the service of UNK STOP
START out of UNK rode the prince of UNK , one of the UNK UNK and a lieutenant general in her armies , a frank , sensitive , popular soldier whose UNK UNK would `` always recall with the UNK UNK '' STOP
START though UNK was UNK at the number of french officers UNK to the UNK standard , there were several under her own , such as the prince de UNK ; ; STOP
START the UNK UNK , UNK de UNK , three year's UNK junior , to whom UNK had taken a UNK ; ; STOP
START and the UNK , colonel UNK , whom the count de UNK had persuaded to UNK his technical skills to UNK STOP
START england contributed a young UNK named UNK and the naval architect samuel UNK , brother to the UNK , who for his UNK commission was UNK a UNK to the russian UNK STOP
START from america were the UNK and jones STOP
START lewis had expected to report at once to UNK and UNK naval command post STOP
START on arrival at headquarters he had , however -- in king UNK words to UNK -- `` found such favor with UNK UNK that he made him his UNK and up to now does not want him to go join paul jones STOP
START '' so of course he stayed put STOP
START having done so , he began to experience all the UNK of others who attempted to get along with UNK and do a job at the same time STOP
START the UNK UNK were quick and his energy UNK , but these qualities were UNK by an UNK UNK and a policy of letting nothing UNK with personal passions STOP
START at headquarters -- sufficiently far from the firing line to make you forget occasionally that you were in a war -- lewis found that the commander in UNK only desk was his knees ( and his only UNK , his fingers ) STOP
START an entire theater had been set up for his UNK , with a UNK italian orchestra under the well-known UNK STOP
START in the great one's personal quarters , a UNK house , almost every evening saw an UNK UNK or reception STOP
START lewis could let his eye UNK the UNK UNK , covered with a UNK and silver UNK cloth , or UNK the lovely UNK , UNK with gold , that spread across the floor STOP
START UNK UNK UNK UNK the UNK of UNK STOP
START around the UNK tables were always at least a couple of dozen UNK UNK STOP
START at dinner the courses were carried in by tall UNK in red UNK and black UNK UNK UNK with UNK of UNK , UNK in pairs like UNK from a stage tragedy STOP
START among the visitors arriving every now and then there were , of course , women STOP
START for if UNK made the sign of the cross with his right hand , and meant it , with his left he UNK UNK to any lady who happened to catch his eye STOP
START usually lewis would find at headquarters one or more of the UNK various UNK STOP
START right now he found UNK de UNK , that magnificent young UNK he had UNK at UNK four years ago STOP
START the prince took her with him on every tour around the area , and it was UNK he was UNK her knowledge of UNK as part of his UNK network STOP
START one evening he passed around the UNK table a crystal cup full of UNK , UNK every female guest to select one as a UNK STOP
START when a lady UNK to soil a pair of evening UNK , UNK UNK was UNK to paris for UNK STOP
START but if the prince UNK women and was UNK by UNK , he could be UNK UNK to his UNK STOP
START he had UNK one of his UNK in public STOP
START his coat UNK in UNK , UNK stars of the orders of UNK UNK or george UNK , he was often UNK to sit UNK , eye UNK , in a UNK UNK STOP
START when this happened , everything stopped STOP
START as UNK noted : `` a complete picture of prince UNK may be had in his UNK operations STOP
START he UNK UNK for half the summer in front of UNK , a quite UNK spot , begins to UNK it UNK only during the UNK UNK , and finally UNK it by assault in the heart of winter STOP
START there's a man who never goes by the ordinary road but still UNK at his goal , who UNK gets himself into difficulty in order to get out of it with UNK , in a word a man who UNK UNK for himself in order to appear a UNK in destroying them '' STOP
START to help him do so the prince had UNK control of his land forces on a soldier who was different from him in almost every respect save one : both were UNK of the UNK UNK UNK STOP
START alexander UNK UNK , now in his UNK year ( ten years UNK senior ) , was a thin , UNK person of less than medium height who looked like a professor of UNK STOP
START he had a small mouth with deep UNK on either side , a large flat nose , and UNK blue eyes STOP
START his gray hair was thin , his face beginning to UNK a UNK of UNK STOP
START he was UNK STOP
START but UNK face was also a theater of UNK , and his tough , UNK little frame was UNK UNK STOP
START like all russians he was an emotional man , and in him the emotions UNK STOP
START kind by nature , he never refused UNK to a UNK or help to anyone who asked him for it ( as lewis would one day discover ) STOP
START but he was UNK engaged in a battle to command his own UNK STOP
START when UNK was introduced , if the general UNK as usual , the UNK faced a UNK UNK of UNK : origin ? ? STOP
START age ? ? STOP
START mission ? ? STOP

START UNK UNK the UNK if he answered UNK STOP
START UNK UNK for UNK was UNK ; ; STOP
START better to give an UNK answer than none at all STOP

START he rose at UNK UNK year round and was apt to UNK through camp UNK like a UNK to UNK his men STOP
START his breakfast was tea ; ; STOP
START his dinner fell anywhere from nine to UNK ; ; STOP
START his UNK was nothing STOP
START he UNK UNK a watch or carried UNK money for years because he UNK both , but highest among his UNK were looking glasses : he had UNK one from an officer's UNK and UNK it to UNK STOP
START he kept several UNK birds and liked UNK well enough that if one UNK by , he would UNK at it in friendly fashion STOP
START passing dogs were UNK with a UNK UNK STOP
START yet general UNK -- who had never forgotten hearing his UNK UNK UNK that all truly great men had UNK -- was UNK only north , northwest STOP
START he had come to learn that a reputation for UNK allowed mere field officers a certain UNK at court ; ; STOP
START in camp he knew it won you the affection of your men STOP
START he had accordingly UNK UNK to the point of second nature STOP
START UNK , he remained one of the UNK russians of his day STOP
START he UNK in verse , could get along well among most of the european languages , and was UNK in french and german STOP
START he had also UNK the UNK tongue STOP
START for those little men with the short UNK , UNK UNK , and top UNK UNK reserved a special UNK STOP
START UNK -- as king UNK knew , and presently informed UNK -- looked on the UNK as UNK tools STOP
START to UNK such UNK as the UNK of the UNK or those UNK the UNK UNK ( in whose islands along the lower UNK the UNK novelist UNK would one day place with fire and UNK ) were just elements for enforced UNK in , say , UNK , where , as `` the UNK of the black sea UNK '' , he could use their presence as UNK points in the UNK territorial claims against UNK STOP
START UNK saw in these UNK UNK not demographic units but military men of a high potential STOP
START he knew how to channel their UNK UNK so as to UNK them from mere UNK into UNK UNK UNK STOP
START he always kept a few on his personal staff STOP
START he often UNK their UNK UNK , such as the one UNK a tall , black UNK UNK from the top of which UNK a little red bag UNK by a chain of UNK UNK and UNK ; ; STOP
START broad red UNK down the UNK leg ; ; STOP
START broader UNK belt round the UNK , holding UNK and light UNK STOP
START UNK played parent not just to his UNK but to all his troops STOP
START it was probably at this period that UNK got his first good look at the ordinary russian soldier STOP
START these UNK UNK UNK from villages all across the UNK empire had , UNK may have told lewis , just two things a commander could count on : physical UNK and personal courage STOP
START when their UNK came UNK into camp , they were all UNK , hair , and UNK STOP
START they emerged as UNK UNK in a UNK but formidable machine : UNK nearly naked , hair UNK , UNK , UNK , and best of all -- in the opinion of the british professional , major UNK -- `` their minds are not UNK from the UNK of UNK by those UNK of knowledge which only serve to lead to UNK and UNK '' STOP
START UNK , UNK her cause , must have said that UNK was the most distinguished UNK in the united states of america , for our man poured out his UNK and drew a UNK UNK line UNK the UNK of his UNK STOP
START `` he's got high blood pressure , too , and UNK UNK '' , the doctor said to me STOP
START `` UNK look , UNK skin -- could well be UNK '' STOP
START he looked UNK at an UNK UNK UNK high with UNK UNK , UNK his head , and moved his hand back and forth in a strong negative gesture STOP
START the little official hung his head in UNK STOP
START seeing this , his UNK at the next desk gave a short , UNK UNK , pushed forward his own UNK UNK , innocent of a single UNK , UNK his chest to show his excellent condition , and looked proud STOP
START the doctor UNK UNK approval STOP
START at this moment UNK came UNK up to UNK that the problem was solved and all UNK had to do was to sign a UNK of papers STOP
START we went out of the office and down the hall to a window where documents and more officials UNK us , the rest of the office personnel hot upon our UNK STOP
START by this time word had got around that an american doctor was on the UNK STOP
START one fellow who had liver spots held out his hands to the great UNK STOP
START it was UNK but it was also UNK STOP
START `` you know '' , UNK said to me later , `` i am thinking of setting up the UNK UNK STOP
START i might not make any money but UNK sure have patients '' STOP
START after UNK we took advantage of the UNK period to try to get in touch with a few people to whom our dear friend UNK had written STOP
START UNK is UNK UNK , a UNK member of the UNK staff who , although born in boston , was born there of greek parents STOP
START several years of her life have been spent in the UNK , and she had written to friends to alert them of our coming STOP
START `` all you have to do , UNK dear , is to UNK on your arrival STOP
START they are UNK to see you '' STOP
START the wear and UNK of life have taught me that very few friends of mutual friends long to see foreign UNK , but i planned on being the soul of UNK , of giving them plenty of UNK was there the UNK UNK that their UNK were already running over without us STOP
START my UNK was UNK STOP
START greek UNK service is worse than french , so that it was to be some little time before contact of any sort was established STOP
START in the late afternoon UNK came back to UNK us , and we drove to the UNK STOP
START we stopped first at the UNK that lies at the foot of the height UNK by the UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK are broken , UNK , UNK , but still in place , as are the UNK UNK , the UNK of honor for the UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK of the frieze against the low wall are for the most part UNK , but their UNK UNK nude and UNK UNK and the UNK UNK are well preserved in their perfect proportion STOP
START having completed our camera work , we started our UNK STOP
START i suppose the same emotion holds , if to a lesser degree , with any famous monument STOP
START will it live up to its reputation ? ? STOP
START the weight of fame and history is formidable , and UNK steel UNK in UNK do little to UNK interest and imagination STOP
START UNK UNK , we think , looking at them , so that's the UNK STOP
START and then perhaps one day we get to UNK STOP
START we are here ! ! STOP
START UNK come a long way and spent a lot of money STOP
START it had better be good STOP
START don't worry about the UNK STOP
START it is UNK STOP
START probably every UNK has a favorite time for his first sight of it STOP
START we saw it frequently UNK , but our suggestion for the very first encounter is near sunset STOP
START the light at that time is a UNK STOP
START the UNK , UNK columns of the UNK , UNK in color against the pure deep blue sky , frame incredible UNK STOP
START all we wanted to do was to stand very UNK and look and look and look STOP
START more than UNK hundred years old , UNK , UNK , UNK and partially destroyed , UNK to an UNK degree UNK and grace , it still stands , UNK testimony to man's UNK STOP
START in UNK the UNK , who had been in control of the city since the UNK century , with a truly UNK lack of UNK used the UNK as a powder magazine STOP
START it was hit by a UNK fired by the UNK UNK army and the great central portion of the temple was UNK to UNK STOP
START nearby is the temple of UNK STOP
START the UNK feature , the UNK UNK the UNK , famous around the world as the UNK of the UNK , was referred to UNK by UNK as the UNK place STOP
START another beautiful building is the UNK , the entrance gate of the UNK STOP
START my other UNK of art and UNK knowledge -- besides UNK that it was UNK who designed the UNK of the UNK in UNK -- is the three styles of greek columns STOP
START for some happy reason UNK , UNK , and UNK have always UNK in my mind STOP
START furthermore i can identify each design STOP
START it remained , however , for UNK to teach me that UNK UNK strength , UNK wisdom , and UNK beauty , the three UNK of the ancient world STOP
START the columns of the UNK are UNK UNK STOP
START another classic sight that gave us considerable pleasure was the UNK UNK , in his ballet UNK with great UNK on his UNK , who was UNK up and down in front of the palace STOP
START gun on shoulder , he would march UNK for a few yards , bring his UNK together with a UNK , make a UNK UNK , UNK UNK , and march back to his point of UNK STOP
START we did not dare speak to so UNK a being , but UNK aimed his camera and shot him , so to speak , on the rise , the split second between the UNK and the turn STOP
START the evening of our first day we drove with UNK and UNK UNK , who were friends and patients of UNK , to UNK at a restaurant on the UNK of the aegean STOP
START on the way out UNK UNK up a special hill from which one may obtain a UNK view of the UNK UNK by night STOP
START the great UNK was a source of UNK , and son et UNK , which the french were trying to promote with the UNK , was the reason STOP
START these performances were being UNK at historical UNK throughout europe STOP
START by a combination of music , lighting effects , and UNK , famous events that have UNK in these locations are UNK and UNK for large audiences usually to considerable UNK STOP
START the UNK had been scheduled for the treatment too , but apparently it was to take place at the time of the full moon when the UNK themselves , out of respect for the natural beauty of the occasion , were UNK to UNK their own usual UNK UNK STOP
START UNK society was split into two UNK , the UNK and the artists STOP
START the artists contended that the UNK , gross of soul , were all for having son et UNK , since the french were UNK the bill and the UNK , wherever it had been done , had UNK popular STOP
START this was the UNK kind of UNK and they , the artists , would have no UNK with it STOP
START the UNK was unique in the world and if that UNK work UNK by UNK wasn't enough for both UNK and UNK , then they were quite simply UNK and the hell with them STOP
START it was very UNK STOP
START the restaurant to which the UNK took us on this night of controversy was the UNK , on UNK beach STOP
START this is a public UNK beach , easily UNK by UNK from the center of UNK STOP
START office workers frequently go out there to lunch and UNK during the UNK period , which , during the summer , UNK from two until five in the afternoon , when UNK and offices are again open for business STOP
START they close UNK after eight STOP
START nine o'clock is the UNK hour , when the UNK are UNK , and by UNK the UNK are beginning to fill STOP
START UNK is late , for the UNK UNK are delightful and everyone wants to UNK under the stars STOP
START the sand is fine and pleasant , the UNK are clean , and the UNK , green , UNK , and butter yellow , are very gay STOP
START although open to the general public it is not UNK ; ; STOP
START the atmosphere is that of an attractive private beach club at home STOP
START we went there a couple of times to UNK and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly STOP
START this UNK state of affairs is UNK , i think , on two counts STOP
START one is greece is not yet suffering from UNK STOP
START the public may still find pleasure in public places STOP
START the other is that the charge for UNK and UNK , though UNK from an american point of view , still is a little high for many UNK STOP
START we were struck by the notable absence of UNK UNK and beer UNK , but just so that we wouldn't go UNK on greek UNK , UNK was UNK by a couple of UNK UNK UNK STOP
START greek boys and girls also go for UNK , and the stations most UNK to are those carrying united states overseas programs STOP
START a good deal of english was spoken on the beach , most educated UNK learn it in childhood , and there were also american wives and children of our overseas UNK STOP
START for a delightful drive out of UNK i should recommend UNK , at the end of the UNK UNK STOP
START the road , a comparatively new one , is very good , UNK along UNK , UNK , and UNK of deep and brilliant blue STOP
START i suppose the day will inevitably come when the area will be UNK with developments , but at present it is UNK and UNK STOP
START three UNK UNK to progress are the lack of water , electricity , and UNK STOP
START at UNK there is a group of beautiful columns , the UNK of a temple to UNK , of particular interest at that time , as active UNK was in progress STOP
START UNK UNK UNK the UNK , and on the ground UNK of columns two and a half to three feet in thickness were being UNK with sections UNK UNK to match exactly the UNK and proportion of the original STOP
START later they would be UNK into place STOP
START there is a UNK restaurant at UNK and i fed a thin little UNK UNK and gave it two UNK of water -- there was no milk -- which it UNK up as though it were UNK STOP
START i think its UNK had never been UNK before STOP
START UNK and i UNK one night in a UNK restaurant in UNK right on the UNK edge STOP
START to enter it , you go down five or six steps from the road STOP

START greece was one of the UNK of our trip , but beginning in greece and continuing around the world throughout UNK asia the treatment of animals was UNK , ranging from UNK UNK to active UNK STOP
START this of course was not true of the educated and sophisticated people we met , who loved their UNK , but UNK is not a basic human UNK STOP
START we met some UNK UNK , and among them our UNK UNK UNK high STOP
START his english was limited , and the little he knew he found UNK STOP
START a particularly UNK phrase was `` UNK UNK , we have time at our disposal '' STOP
START this he claimed was the favorite UNK of the english STOP

START in proportion to the UNK of his moral worth , is the increase of his worth to them '' STOP
START to UNK the UNK and thereby UNK himself from a UNK situation , pike took another course and made it appear that the UNK had been UNK STOP
START he claimed in his UNK that woodruff , with UNK UNK , had deliberately written an ambiguous bid that had so confused the honest members of the UNK that they had awarded him the contract without knowing what they were doing STOP
START the charge was so UNK that woodruff paid little attention to it , and answered pike in a rather UNK way , UNK UNK that a `` new hand '' was UNK the UNK of the UNK UNK , and UNK : `` in a controversy with an UNK so utterly UNK of moral principles , even a UNK would UNK the victor to no UNK STOP
START the game is not worth the UNK it would cost STOP
START we therefore leave the writer to the enjoyment of the UNK reputation which the personal UNK he has UNK on us will UNK him to from the low and UNK herd to which he belongs '' STOP
START despite UNK continuing refusal to debate with pike through the columns of his newspaper , pike did not let up his attack for a moment STOP
START over the months he became a political UNK with an UNK UNK of UNK poems UNK woodruff , the `` UNK '' letters UNK woodruff , and long UNK articles UNK woodruff STOP
START so persistent were these UNK that in march of the following year , woodruff was finally moved to action , and pike was to learn his first lesson in frontier politics , the subtle art of UNK STOP
START to attack pike directly would gain woodruff little , for as a UNK UNK pike had nothing to lose STOP
START by this time woodruff had accurately measured pike as a man of great personal pride , a man who would fly into a UNK UNK if his UNK were questioned , and who would be anxious to UNK himself STOP
START UNK honor would now come under attack , but not by woodruff himself STOP
START the charges would be made in the UNK by an UNK UNK , and pike would be so busy trying to track down the UNK character UNK that he would forget about UNK woodruff STOP
START the strategy worked perfectly STOP
START pike was UNK by the first UNK against his character , which was published in the march UNK issue of the UNK under the name `` UNK '' STOP
START the UNK UNK did not UNK to UNK STOP
START he called pike a UNK STOP
START he said pike had UNK UNK from UNK during the santa UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START he accused pike of continuing his UNK career in arkansas with the UNK of some UNK UNK in van UNK STOP
START the charges caught pike off balance , coming as they did from an unexpected quarter STOP
START UNK , he used the UNK of march 7th for a denial , sending immediately to santa UNK and van UNK for documents to UNK himself , and demanding that woodruff reveal the name of this UNK UNK who UNK himself under a UNK UNK STOP
START woodruff said nothing , and pike , UNK , UNK throughout little rock in an UNK search for `` UNK '' , asking his friends to keep their ears open STOP
START finally he learned through the UNK that the UNK might be one james UNK in pope county STOP
START without further inquiry , pike UNK to the conclusion that robinson was guilty , and , following the UNK route that would eventually lead to the UNK ground , sent a message to robinson through his friends , demanding that he either confirm or deny his UNK STOP
START robinson did neither STOP
START to pike , silence was UNK to an admission of guilt , and he determined to get robinson onto the UNK ground at all costs STOP
START on april UNK he wrote an open letter in the UNK , making it known `` to the world that UNK is by his own admission a base UNK and a UNK '' STOP
START if robinson was a UNK and a UNK , he was also a very UNK gentleman , for nothing that pike could do would UNK so much as a single word out of him STOP
START UNK with his own defense and his attempts to get robinson to fight , pike UNK his UNK on woodruff , and finally stopped them altogether STOP
START and pike never did find out if robinson was really responsible for the `` UNK '' letter STOP
START UNK strategy had been UNK successful STOP
START it took pike a long time to realize what woodruff had done , and it had a profound effect on him STOP
START once he learned a lesson , he never UNK it STOP
START in the next few months of comparative silence , pike waited UNK until conditions were perfect for a new attack , and then , UNK a remarkable UNK of the UNK of political UNK , gained from his first UNK with woodruff , he used these changed conditions to excellent advantage STOP
START shortly after the `` UNK '' incident , a UNK began to develop between william woodruff and governor pope STOP
START UNK , UNK , UNK honest , governor pope had been the ideal man to assume office in arkansas after the UNK UNK of political UNK like UNK , and he ruled the state with an iron UNK , UNK no UNK STOP
START woodruff had supported him all the way , both as a chief executive and as a man STOP
START besides being political allies , they were also friends STOP
START this warm relationship came to an abrupt end in june of UNK when the national congress UNK UNK for UNK and printing the laws of arkansas territory , and , taking note of the recent wave of UNK in the UNK , left it to the governor to award the contract STOP
START woodruff wanted this political UNK very badly , and everyone assumed that he would get it because he was a close friend of the governor and his UNK UNK STOP
START after all , woodruff owned a competent printing plant and was the logical man for the job STOP
START but because the governor was determined that friendship should not influence him one way or the other , he looked for a UNK with a knowledge of the law ( which woodruff did not have ) , and awarded the contract to a lawyer named john steele who had started a newspaper in UNK the year before STOP
START woodruff was UNK STOP
START considering the UNK act a personal UNK , he UNK his feelings in the UNK on august 26 , UNK : : STOP
START `` we think the governor treated us rather UNK , to say the least of it STOP
START it is but justice to UNK for us to add that , in the above remarks , nothing is intended to his UNK , either as a lawyer or as a UNK STOP
START he got a good fat job and we UNK him on his good luck STOP
START we hope that he will UNK it in a manner that will UNK him to credit '' STOP
START as summer cooled into fall and winter , even so the relationship between the two men continued to grow UNK by the day , and by december of UNK it was UNK STOP
START it was at this point that pike decided to UNK on the bad feelings between the two men STOP
START the UNK prize in this new battle was the public printing contract that woodruff still held STOP
START from his first UNK with the UNK woodruff , pike had learned that it was better not to attack him directly , so , UNK on the theme that the cost of printing was too high , he condemned the governor for UNK such a state of affairs to exist STOP
START to UNK his charge , pike set up two parallel columns in the UNK showing the price charged by the UNK and the considerably lower price for which the work could be done elsewhere STOP
START then he called on the governor to explain why STOP
START the governor was not used to having his UNK questioned , and he promptly passed the charges on to woodruff , demanding that woodruff answer them STOP
START if woodruff could not furnish a strong explanation , the governor insisted that he lower his prices in UNK with the scale printed in the UNK STOP
START woodruff was now UNK on the UNK of a dilemma STOP
START as a proud man , his prestige would suffer if he let pike UNK to him through the UNK office , but to lower his prices would be UNK to an admission that they had been too high in the first place STOP
START as a consequence , he did neither STOP
START very angry at woodruff , the governor used his personal influence to have the printing contract UNK from the UNK and awarded to the UNK UNK , which , by a strange UNK , happened to be UNK UNK STOP
START and , for the moment at least , the governor now found himself UNK with the head of the UNK UNK he had formerly opposed , and pike was UNK with a clear UNK over woodruff STOP
START but in the confused atmosphere of frontier politics , UNK were as quickly broken as they were formed , and as pike came to favor with the governor of the territory , the governor fell out of favor with the president of the united states STOP
START on january UNK , UNK , UNK jackson removed pope from office and UNK territorial secretary william UNK to the position STOP
START UNK was a very close friend of jackson , and had been his private secretary for a number of years in the old days STOP
START as a UNK party man and a UNK UNK , he had little UNK for UNK like pike , and pike lost any immediate personal advantage his victory over woodruff might have gained him STOP
START 2 STOP

START as pike proved himself UNK in the political UNK , he also became a social lion in the village of little rock , where he served as a symbol of the culture that the UNK of the town were UNK so UNK to UNK STOP
START after all , pike was an established poet and his work had been published in the respectable UNK of that center of american culture , boston STOP
START his UNK , and the fact that he was UNK , did much to UNK the UNK words UNK used to describe little rock after a visit there STOP
START for some reason , none of them were impressed with the territorial capital STOP
START the UNK known UNK and UNK UNK UNK was typical of its UNK in the UNK STOP
START `` little rock is a UNK , UNK place STOP
START '' he wrote STOP
START `` little rock is , without any UNK , one of the UNK towns in the united states and i would not have remained two hours in the place , if i had not met with some good friends who made me forget its UNK '' STOP
START pike enjoyed his new social position UNK , and UNK in himself those UNK necessary to its preservation STOP
START he was especially popular with women , for , like the romantic poetry he wrote , he was personally UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START he again began to play the UNK , and UNK the instrument beneath his UNK , performed UNK and romantic UNK to match the expressions on the faces of the lovely women who gathered to hear him STOP
START his artistic UNK UNK him entry into any social gathering STOP
START he composed songs and set them to music and UNK them in a soft , UNK voice , and when his audience had had enough of music he would UNK on politics or tell stories of his western UNK UNK to UNK the emotions of men and women alike STOP
START the UNK of his early reputation , however , came not from his poetry or his music , but from his UNK as an UNK STOP
START by UNK the art of UNK had reached a very high level in the united states as a literary form STOP
START the UNK of this period , in order to earn a reputation , had to pay close attention to the formal composition of his speech , UNK how it would appear in UNK as well as the effect it would have on the audience that heard it STOP
START very soon after his arrival in little rock , pike had joined one of the most influential organizations in town , the little rock UNK society , and it was with this group that he made his UNK as an UNK , being invited to deliver the annual fourth of july address the club sponsored every year STOP
START samuel gorton , UNK of UNK , was UNK by the historian samuel greene UNK `` one of the most remarkable men who ever lived '' STOP
START a UNK called him `` the UNK john the baptist of new england UNK '' STOP

START edward UNK , secretary of the colony of massachusetts bay , described him as `` a man whose spirit was UNK UNK with UNK and UNK , a UNK of the truth , a UNK of the peace wherever he comes '' STOP
START UNK UNK stated he `` was deeply UNK with UNK and UNK opinions '' STOP
START he was thrown out , more or less , from boston , UNK , UNK , newport , and providence STOP
START on the other hand , UNK styles recorded the following testimony of john UNK , the last UNK of gorton : `` STOP
START he said gorton was a holy man ; ; STOP
START UNK day and night for the UNK and blindness of the world had a long walk through the trees and woods by his house , where he constantly walked morning and evening , and even in the depths of the night , alone by himself , for UNK and the enjoyment of the UNK of light STOP
START he was UNK beloved by his UNK , and the indians , who UNK him , not only as a friend , but one high in UNK with god in heaven '' STOP
START gorton sometimes signed himself `` a professor of the UNK of christ '' STOP
START there is plenty more to recommend gorton , the facts of whose life are given in the life and times of samuel gorton , by UNK gorton STOP
START he fought like a UNK for the helpless and UNK , worked for the UNK of slavery , helped the UNK and indians , and worked against the UNK of UNK STOP
START he UNK the boston UNK , and after they sent a small army to get him he UNK the court , including john cotton , with one of the most complicated religious UNK ever heard STOP
START samuel gorton was born at gorton , england , near the present city of manchester , about UNK STOP
START although he did not attend any UNK schools or universities , he was a master of greek and UNK and could read the bible in the original STOP
START he worked as a `` UNK '' in london , but was greatly concerned with religion STOP
START gorton left england , he said , `` to enjoy UNK of conscience in respect to faith towards god , and for no other end '' STOP
START with his wife and three or more children he arrived in boston in march , UNK , and soon found it was no place for anyone looking for liberty of conscience STOP
START UNK UNK had recently been thrown out , and UNK UNK and her UNK were UNK it out with the UNK STOP
START gorton and his family moved to UNK STOP
START soon he was in trouble there , for UNK a woman who was accused of UNK in church STOP
START she was UNK UNK , a UNK of good UNK who was employed by UNK wife and lived with the family STOP
START the report was : `` STOP
START it had been UNK UNK that she had UNK in the congregation , and the governor UNK sent to UNK her business , and command , after punishment as the bench see fit , her UNK and also anyone who brought her to the place from which she came ' '' STOP
START gorton said they were preparing to UNK her as a UNK , and to escape the UNK she fled to the woods for several days , returning at night STOP
START he advised the poor woman not to appear in court as what she was charged with was not in violation of law STOP
START gorton appeared for her , however , and what he told the UNK must have been plenty , for he was charged with UNK the court , UNK , and told to leave the colony within fourteen days STOP
START he left in a UNK for UNK , december 4 , UNK STOP
START his wife was in UNK health and UNK an UNK with UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK was UNK at UNK , after having been UNK by the boston church and thrown out of the colony STOP
START one can imagine that with her and gorton there it was no place for anyone with weak UNK STOP
START william UNK , who was running the colony , felt UNK to move seven miles south where , with others -- as mentioned above -- he founded newport STOP
START when , in march , UNK , the two towns were united under UNK , gorton claimed the union was UNK and UNK UNK and that it had never been UNK by the majority of UNK STOP
START then he became involved in a UNK remarkably similar to the one in UNK STOP
START a cow owned by an old woman UNK on UNK land STOP
START while driving the cow back home the woman was UNK by a servant maid of gorton STOP
START the old woman complained to the UNK governor , who ordered the servant brought before the court STOP
START gorton UNK to his UNK tactics , refused to let her go , and appeared himself before the UNK grand jury STOP
START during the trial he told off the jury , called them `` just UNK '' and called a UNK `` a UNK boy and UNK '' STOP
START he was UNK and UNK STOP
START gorton then moved to providence and soon put the town in a UNK STOP
START he held that no group of UNK could set up or maintain a government without royal UNK STOP
START since rhode island at that time did not have such UNK , his opinion was not popular STOP
START UNK UNK wrote his friend UNK as follows : `` STOP

START UNK also stated : `` our peace was like the peace of a man who UNK the UNK UNK '' STOP
START providence finally managed to get gorton out of the town , and he and some friends bought land at UNK on the west side of UNK bay , five miles south but still within the jurisdiction of the providence colony STOP
START this town should not be confused with UNK , just north of providence , or UNK , connecticut , on the UNK river , opposite UNK , rhode island STOP
START up to now , gorton had been looking for trouble , and now that he was trying to get away from it , trouble started looking for him STOP
START upon intelligence that the formidable UNK was to favor them with his presence , the UNK UNK of UNK , UNK , gave their UNK to massachusetts and asked that colony to UNK the UNK STOP
START as it was the custom of that alert colony to take over the property of persons asking for protection , this was an act roughly equivalent to UNK open the door to a pack of UNK and saying `` come and get it '' STOP
START gorton and company , however , promptly bought land from UNK a few miles south of UNK , extending from the present UNK point south to UNK neck and twenty miles UNK STOP
START the settlement was called UNK STOP
START it was not within the jurisdiction of anybody or anything , including providence and massachusetts STOP
START if gorton wanted peace and quiet for his complicated UNK this is where he should have had it STOP
START instead of that he was UNK by UNK STOP
START UNK and UNK , a couple of minor UNK ( of something less than UNK character ) under UNK , declared that they had never UNK to the sale of land to gorton and had never received anything for it STOP
START following the UNK lead of the heroes of UNK , they also submitted themselves to the protection of massachusetts STOP
START one historical authority presents UNK and UNK testimony UNK to UNK suspicion that massachusetts was behind the clouds UNK down on the UNK gorton STOP
START however , the general court at boston ordered the UNK of UNK to appear before them to answer the UNK claim STOP
START the UNK rejected the order in two letters written in vigorous terms STOP
START then massachusetts UNK to its standard tactics STOP
START it pointed out UNK instances of UNK in the letters , and ordered the writers to UNK or force of arms would be used STOP

START we got UNK to him as quickly as we could , and we UNK tom of UNK desperate condition STOP
START the UNK was in the UNK region ; ; STOP
START UNK saw at once what had happened STOP
START `` he has lost much blood '' , he said STOP
START `` UNK take a lot to replace it '' STOP
START `` UNK , i've got a lot of blood '' , fred spoke up , `` plenty of it STOP
START let me give papa blood '' STOP
START the doctor agreed , but explained that it would be necessary first to check UNK blood to UNK whether or not it was of the same type as UNK STOP
START to give a patient the wrong type of blood , said the doctor , would likely kill him STOP
START that was in the days before blood banks , of course , and UNK had to be given directly from UNK to patient STOP
START one had to find a UNK , and usually very quickly , whose blood UNK with the patient's STOP
START and then it took considerably longer to make preparations for giving UNK STOP
START they had to take blood samples to the laboratory to test them , for one thing , and there was much required preliminary procedure STOP
START they made the tests and came to fred ; ; STOP
START by now it was perhaps two days or longer after papa had begun UNK STOP
START `` fred , your blood UNK your father's , all right '' , UNK said STOP

START papa had left us about the same hour of the night that UNK had passed on STOP
START the date was june 20 , UNK STOP
START `` UNK , prominent business man and pioneer UNK of this section , died shortly after UNK UNK at his home UNK UNK street '' , the UNK times of UNK , june 21 , announced STOP

START a UNK sketch followed STOP
START UNK services were held UNK afternoon at four o'clock at the home STOP
START beloved UNK , our first UNK church UNK , was in charge STOP
START the UNK was out in UNK UNK STOP
START all about him stood UNK his own sensitive great hands had UNK STOP
START a few years before his death papa had agreed with mama to make a joint will with her in which it would be provided that in the event of the death of either of them an accounting would be made to their children whereby each child would receive a UNK of UNK cash STOP
START at his death fred and ralph , my husband , were named UNK of the estate under the terms of the will STOP
START fred and ralph qualified as UNK and paid off what UNK were currently due , and they were all current , since papa was never one to allow bills to go UNK STOP
START the bills were UNK for UNK and UNK fees during the last years of his life , and when he died he UNK in the main only current UNK bills STOP
START after they had paid all his UNK and the UNK costs , ralph and fred had some fourteen thousand dollars , as i remember , with which to pay the UNK STOP
START this , UNK , would not provide UNK to each of the UNK five children STOP
START so what fred and ralph did was to attempt to UNK the money fairly by taking into account what each of the five had received , if anything , from the estate before UNK death STOP
START consequently , fred and tom , the two who had been provided college UNK , signed statements to the effect that each had received his UNK in full , and UNK and i were each UNK UNK STOP
START frank had been given about half his UNK to use in a business venture before UNK death ; ; STOP
START he was given the difference between that amount and UNK STOP
START tom had received four years of education at the university of north carolina and two at harvard , and fred had been in and out of georgia UNK and UNK UNK and part of the time had been a self-help student STOP
START so , because he had received less than tom , it was felt proper that fred should receive the few hundred dollars that remained STOP
START and that's how UNK estate was divided STOP
START papa , i should emphasize , had been an UNK the last several years of his life ; ; STOP
START his hospital and doctor bills had been large and his income had been cut until he was receiving little except small UNK on some properties he still owned STOP
START had he been able to escape this long UNK of UNK , i'm convinced , papa would have left a UNK estate STOP
START but he had succeeded well , we agreed STOP
START he had left us a UNK far more valuable than houses and lands and UNK and bonds STOP
START for years papa and mama had been large UNK STOP
START i recall that several years their taxes UNK UNK STOP
START in those years of lower property UNK and lower tax rates , that payment represented ownership of much property STOP
START `` UNK god , UNK '' ! ! STOP
START i have known papa to UNK on getting his tax bill , `` UNK going to the dogs '' ! ! STOP
START but he never expected to do that STOP
START and he didn't , by a long shot ! ! STOP
START UNK STOP
START in the spring of his second year at harvard , tom had been offered a job at UNK university as an UNK in the english department STOP
START but he had delayed accepting this job , and as he was leaving to come home to papa in response to our UNK , he dropped a UNK to miss UNK , head of the harvard UNK office , asking her please to write UNK authorities and explain the circumstances STOP
START actually tom had been UNK giving them an answer , i'm UNK , because he did not want to go out there to teach STOP
START in fact , he didn't want to teach anywhere STOP
START he wanted to go back to harvard for another year of UNK STOP
START but UNK death had further complicated the financing of UNK UNK third year , and for the weeks following it tom did not know whether his return to harvard could be arranged STOP
START but things were worked out in the family and late in august he wrote miss UNK an UNK letter in which he told her that matters at home had been in an UNK condition after UNK death and he had not known whether he would stay at home with mama , accept the UNK job , or return to harvard STOP
START but he was happy to tell her that his UNK were now in such condition that he could go back to harvard for a third year with professor baker STOP
START and that's what he did STOP
START that third year he wrote plays with a UNK STOP
START i believe there are seventeen short plays by tom now UNK in the UNK UNK at harvard ; ; STOP
START i think i'm right in that figure STOP
START that fall he submitted to professor baker the first acts and UNK of the following acts of several plays , six of them , according to some of his UNK , and he also worked on a play that he first called UNK , the material for which he had collected during the summer at home STOP
START later this play would be called welcome to our city STOP
START in the spring , it must have been , he began working on the play that he called the house , which later would be UNK STOP
START that spring welcome to our city was selected for production by the UNK workshop and it was UNK in the middle of may STOP
START it ran two nights , and though it was generally UNK , there was considerable criticism of its length STOP
START it ran until past one o'clock STOP
START that was UNK weakness ; ; STOP
START it was demonstrated , many critics would later point out , in the length of his novels STOP
START in this play there were so many characters and so much detail STOP
START tom never knew how to UNK , to UNK down STOP
START he was always concerned with life , and he tried to picture it whole ; ; STOP
START he wanted nothing UNK , UNK STOP
START he was a big man , and he wanted nothing little , UNK ; ; STOP
START he UNK UNK , and particularly of words STOP
START in this play there were some thirty or more named characters and i don't know how many more UNK STOP
START in describing it to professor baker after it had been chosen for production , he defended his great UNK of characters by UNK that he had included that many not because `` i didn't know how to save paint '' , but because the play required them STOP
START and he threatened UNK to write a play `` with fifty , UNK , a hundred people -- a whole town , a whole race , a whole UNK '' STOP
START he said he would do it , though probably nobody would produce it , for his own `` UNK ease and comfort '' STOP
START that summer tom attended the summer session at harvard , but he did not ask mama to send him back in the fall STOP
START instead , he went down to new york and submitted welcome to our city to the theatre UNK , which had asked him to let them have a look at it after professor baker had recommended it highly STOP
START he hung around new york , waiting to hear whether they would accept it for production and in that time came down to UNK and also paid a short visit to chapel hill , where with almost UNK delight he visited old friends and favorite campus spots STOP
START on returning to new york he had a job for several weeks ; ; STOP
START it was visiting university of north carolina UNK in new york to ask them for contributions to the UNK UNK building fund STOP
START the UNK UNK would be the campus student union UNK the late and much beloved edward UNK UNK , who had been president when tom entered the university STOP
START well , the theatre UNK kept that play , and kept it , and finally in december they turned it down STOP
START but they would UNK it , they assured him , if he would UNK it STOP
START tom told me about it , how one evening he went over to see the theatre UNK man STOP
START this man , tom said , had the play shut up in his desk , i believe , and when tom sat down , he pulled it out and UNK told tom that they wouldn't be able to use it STOP
START tom said he almost burst into tears , he was so UNK and put out STOP
START the man , tom said , explained that it was not only too long and detailed but that as it stood it wasn't the sort of thing the public wanted STOP
START the public , tom said the man told him , wanted realism , and his play wasn't that STOP
START it was fantastic writing , beautiful writing , the man declared , but the public , he insisted , wanted realism STOP
START tom was not willing to UNK the play according to the plan the man suggested STOP
START such a UNK , he said , would UNK it , would change his whole conception of the play as well as the treatment STOP
START he thought about it and he told the man he just couldn't do it over in accordance with the suggestions he had made STOP
START it was not until we had returned to the city to live , while i was still at brown and UNK , that i felt the full impact of UNK christianity STOP
START i came under the UNK of a younger group in the church led by the UNK older son STOP
START the spirit of this group was that we were -- and are -- living in a world UNK to eternal punishment , but that god through jesus christ has provided a way of escape for those who UNK their UNK and accept salvation STOP
START there are millions who accept this doctrine , but few indeed are those who accept it so truly that the fate of humanity lies as a weight on their souls night and day STOP
START this group in park place church was made up of the earnest few STOP
START i was drawn deeper and deeper into these concerns and responsibilities STOP
START i engaged more and more in religious activities STOP
START besides church and sunday school i went to UNK meetings on the sidewalk at the church door STOP
START i went to an afternoon service at the aj STOP
START i went to the christian UNK society and to the evening service of the church STOP
START much of this lacked the active support of the UNK STOP
START the young people were UNK , and i was UNK STOP
START once or twice my father asked me if i wasn't UNK a bit in my UNK STOP
START meanwhile i myself was not yet saved STOP
START at least i had been unable to lay hold on the experience of conversion STOP
START try as i might to UNK my UNK and accept salvation , no answer came to me from heaven STOP
START finally , after years , i gave up STOP
START the basic difficulty , i suppose , was in my ultimate inability to feel a burden of sin from which i sought relief STOP
START i was familiar with UNK progress , which i read as literature STOP
START no load of sin had been laid on my shoulders , nor did earnest effort enable me to become conscious of one STOP
START there is , of course , the doctrine of original sin , which UNK that each of us as individuals UNK of the guilt of our first UNK STOP
START in the UNK UNK this doctrine is UNK thus : `` in UNK fall we UNK all '' STOP
START this doctrine was UNK to my moral sense STOP
START i did not feel it UNK to expect that the creator would be at least as just as the most UNK of his creatures ; ; STOP
START and the doctrine of original sin is UNK of injustice STOP
START some of these thoughts -- not all of them -- have taken organized form in later years STOP
START the actual UNK force which UNK me from UNK effort was of another sort STOP
START i became UNK at being so UNK with the state of my own UNK soul STOP
START i found myself becoming one of that group of people who , in UNK words , `` are forever UNK into their own UNK , UNK asking ' am i right , am i wrong ' '' ? ? STOP
START i UNK me of the UNK prayer , and these words came to mind : `` thy kingdom come , thy will be done , on earth as it is in heaven '' STOP
START they have remained on the opened page of my mind in all the years which since have passed STOP
START from that time to this my religious concern is that i might give effective help to the bringing in of god's kingdom on earth STOP
START i do not claim to be free from sin , or from the need for UNK and UNK STOP
START in my experience the assurance of UNK comes only when i have UNK to the UNK one and have made as full UNK as i can UNK STOP
START there was one further step in my religious progress STOP
START this was taken after i came to live in UNK , and it was made under the guidance of the UNK UNK UNK , a young UNK who came to the congregational church there at about the same time that i moved from new york STOP
START his father was a professor at UNK theological UNK , and from him he acquired a conviction , which he passed along to me , that there is in the universe of persons a moral law , the law of love , which is a natural law in the same sense as is the physical law STOP
START it is most important that we recognize the law of love as being UNK in all personal relationships , whether individually , UNK or as between whole nations of people STOP
START if UNK , the law brings order and satisfaction STOP
START if UNK , the result is UNK and chaos STOP
START as we observe moral law and physical law they appear as being inevitable STOP
START we can conceive of no alternatives STOP
START their basis seems deeper than mere authority STOP
START they are not true because scientists or UNK say they are true STOP
START it is not the authority of god himself which makes them true STOP
START because god is what he is , the laws of the universe , material and spiritual , are what they are STOP
START UNK and law are one and UNK STOP
START with this conviction , the UNK between the sacred and the secular UNK STOP
START one's daily work becomes sacred , since it is performed in the field of influence of the moral law , dealing as it does with people as well as with matter and energy STOP
START in his book civilization and ethics albert UNK faces the moral problems which arise when moral law is recognized in business life , for example STOP
START his ethics UNK `` UNK as the property of the community , of which the individual is sovereign UNK STOP
START one serves society by UNK a business from which a certain number of employees draw their means of UNK ; ; STOP
START another by giving away his property in order to help his fellow man STOP
START each will decide on his own course UNK between these two extreme cases according to the sense of responsibility which is determined for him by the particular circumstances of his own life STOP
START no one is to judge others '' STOP
START he is UNK in UNK guilt to the man who finds it necessary to UNK or permit injury to one individual or group for the sake of a larger good STOP
START for this decision a man must take personal responsibility STOP
START says he , `` i may never imagine that in the struggle between personal and UNK responsibility it is possible to make a UNK between the ethical and the UNK in the shape of a relative UNK ; ; STOP
START or to let the ethical be UNK by the UNK STOP
START on the contrary it is my duty to make my own decision as between the two '' STOP
START UNK seems , in fact , to acquire for himself a burden of sin , not UNK by adam , but UNK in the inevitable judgments which life requires of him as between greater and lesser responsibilities STOP
START this viewpoint i find interesting , but it has never weighed on my soul STOP
START perhaps it should have STOP
START my own experience has followed simpler lines STOP
START an UNK belief in the moral law has the advantage of making religion natural , even as physical law is natural STOP
START neither the engineer nor the ordinary citizen feels any UNK in UNK the laws of matter and energy , nor can he achieve a sense of UNK in such UNK STOP
START to UNK the moral law is just ordinary common sense , applied to a UNK field STOP
START religion thus becomes UNK with life STOP
START this truth that the moral law is natural has other important UNK STOP
START one of them is that it gives meaning and purpose to life STOP
START in seeking for such meaning and purpose , albert UNK UNK upon the concept of the `` UNK of life '' STOP
START it is UNK to the UNK mind ( to mine at least ) to assign `` UNK '' to animal , insect , and plant life STOP
START these lives are in themselves outside of the moral order and are UNK with moral responsibility STOP
START there is indeed a moral responsibility on man himself , for his own UNK sake , to respect lower life and to avoid the UNK of suffering , but this viewpoint UNK UNK STOP
START so far as `` UNK '' UNK in any aspect of creation it seems to me to be found in human personality , whether in UNK , africa , or in washington , UNK STOP
START one cannot read the records of scientists , officials and UNK who have UNK to the minds of the most UNK races without UNK that each individual met with is a person STOP
START read , for instance , in UNK UNK UNK people of UNK and her wise father UNK UNK , and her final adjustment to UNK civilization STOP
START above all read in UNK UNK the last UNK show the old man of the UNK UNK ( not UNK ) in central UNK gave to the white man his UNK possession , while the tears UNK down his face STOP
START the UNK UNK is the conventional UNK of UNK humanity ; ; STOP
START yet here was a depth of UNK which is lacking in a considerable portion of the UNK of our civilization STOP
START persons , whether white , black , brown or yellow , are a concern of god STOP
START respect for personality is a privilege and a duty for us as brothers STOP
START such is the field for UNK our UNK STOP
START as to our action , let us UNK ourselves with the purpose expressed by jesus in the UNK prayer : `` thy kingdom come , thy will be done , on earth as it is in heaven '' STOP
START with the knowledge that the kingdom comes by UNK to the moral law in our relations with all people , we have a firm intellectual UNK on both the means and the ends of our lives STOP
START this intellectual approach to spiritual life suited me well , because i was never content to lead a divided life STOP
START as i have said , words from UNK remain ever in my memory : `` that mind and soul , according well , may make one music as before '' STOP
START let us now give some thought to the soul STOP
START when the young UNK , UNK , began to show interest in our daughter UNK , this induced a corresponding interest , on our part , in him STOP
START i asked one day what he was doing STOP
START he told me that he had a big UNK and a little UNK and that he was UNK a big eye of the big UNK onto the little UNK and a little eye of the little UNK onto the big UNK STOP
START he was then noting that the big eye on the little UNK hung back until the little eye had grown up to it , while the little eye on the big UNK grew rapidly until it was as big as the other STOP
START then i asked , `` what does that teach you '' ? ? STOP
START said he , `` it UNK me to wonder '' STOP
START this was a profound statement STOP
START in the face of the UNK universe , our ultimate attitude is that of wonder STOP
START wonder is indeed the intellectual UNK to the spiritual world STOP
START gone are the days when , in the nineteenth century , scientists thought that they were close to the UNK of complete knowledge of the physical universe STOP
START for them only a little more needed to be learned , and then all physical knowledge could be UNK UNK , UNK and put in the inventory to be drawn on for the solution of any human problem STOP
START this UNK was UNK to UNK by the UNK of UNK , the UNK of the complex UNK of the atom and the discovery of the expanding universe STOP
START none of these UNK were UNK UNK off UNK of knowledge STOP
START each UNK out into the UNK areas of the future STOP
START it is as if we , in our center of human observation , from time to time UNK more deeply into the unknown STOP
START as our UNK of penetration , r , increases , the area of new knowledge increases by af , and the total of human knowledge becomes measured in terms of af STOP
START wonder grows STOP
START it is UNK STOP
START there are some people , UNK people , who seem to be UNK by the sea of wonder in which we are UNK and in which we spend our lives STOP
START one such is UNK UNK , the writer of a recent book , speaking of man STOP
START this is a UNK denial of the spiritual world and a vigorous defense of pure UNK STOP
START his inability to wonder UNK his argument STOP
START the subject of immortality brings to mind a vivid incident which took place in UNK at UNK in UNK STOP
START criticism is as old as literary art and we can set the stage for our study of three UNK if we see how certain critics in the past have dealt with the ethical aspects of literature STOP
START i have chosen five UNK pairs , ten men in all , and they are arranged in roughly UNK order STOP
START such a list must naturally be selective , and the treatment of each man is brief , for i am interested only in their general ideas on the moral measure of literature STOP
START altogether , the list will give us considerable variety in attitudes and some typical ones , for these critics range all the way from UNK to those who consider art above ethics , all the way from plato to UNK STOP
START and most of the great periods are represented , because we will compare plato and aristotle from the golden age of greece ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK and sir UNK UNK from renaissance england ; ; STOP
START UNK and william UNK of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in england ; ; STOP
START and james UNK UNK and UNK UNK UNK of nineteenth century american letters STOP
START plato and aristotle STOP
START plato and aristotle agree on some vital literary issues STOP
START they both measure literature by moral standards , and in their political writings both allow for UNK , but the differences between them are also significant STOP
START while aristotle UNK literature only for the young , plato would UNK all poets from his ideal state STOP
START even more important , in his UNK , aristotle UNK somewhat from plato when he moves in the direction of UNK literature as a unique thing , separate and apart from its causes and its effects STOP
START all through the republic , plato UNK to the way art UNK to the general life and ultimately to a good life for his citizens STOP
START in short , he is constantly concerned with the ethical effects STOP
START when he UNK the subject matter of poetry , he UNK what moral effect the scenes will have STOP
START when he turns briefly to literary style , in the third book , he again looks to the effect on the audience STOP
START he explains that his citizens must not be UNK by any of the UNK of the UNK or heroes that one finds in much poetry , and he UNK that all `` these UNK UNK '' will be sent to another state STOP
START only those story UNK will remain who can `` UNK the style of the UNK '' STOP
START plato is , at times , just as UNK of the poets themselves as he is of their work STOP
START when he UNK UNK in the eighth book of the republic , he pictures the poets as willing to UNK the worst UNK STOP
START but the most fundamental objection he has to poets appears in the UNK book , and it is derived from his doctrine of ideal forms STOP
START in plato's mind there is an UNK conflict between the poet and the philosopher , because the poet UNK only particular objects and is UNK of rising to the first level of abstraction , much less the highest level of ideal forms STOP
START true reality , of course , is the ideal , and the poet knows nothing of this ; ; STOP
START only the philosopher knows the truth STOP
START poets , moreover , UNK on human passions STOP
START and with this point about the passions , we encounter plato's UNK STOP
START the same sort of thinking plays so large a part in both UNK and more , that we must examine it in some detail STOP
START plato feels that man has two UNK aspects , his rational faculty and his UNK STOP
START we can be UNK only if we control our lower UNK , the passions in this case , and UNK our rational side ; ; STOP
START and poetry , with all its emphasis on the passions , UNK the audience to give way to emotion STOP
START for this reason , then , poetry tends to UNK the power of control , the reason , because it UNK one to UNK his passions , and even the best of men , he maintains , may be UNK by this subtle influence STOP
START plato's attitude toward poetry has always been something of an UNK , because he is so completely sensitive to its UNK STOP
START his whole objection , indeed , seems to rise out of a deep conviction that the poets do have great power to influence , but plato seldom UNK any attention to what might be called the poem itself STOP
START he is , rather , concerned with the effect on society and he wants the poets to join his fight for justice STOP
START he wants them to use their great power to UNK man's rational side , to teach virtue , and to encourage religion STOP
START while plato finally allows a few acceptable UNK to the UNK and famous men , still he clearly leaves the way open for further discussion of the issue STOP
START he even calls upon the poets to UNK the UNK and to show that poetry may contribute to virtue STOP
START he says : `` STOP
START we may further grant to those of her ( UNK ) UNK who are UNK of poetry and yet not poets , the permission to speak in prose on her behalf : let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to states and to human life , and we will listen in a UNK spirit ; ; STOP
START for if this can be proved we shall surely be the UNK -- i mean , if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight '' STOP
START when we turn to UNK ideas on the moral measure of literature , it is at once apparent that he is at times equally concerned about the influence of the art STOP
START in the ideal state , for instance , he UNK that the young citizens should hear only the most carefully selected tales and stories STOP
START for this reason , he would UNK UNK pictures and speeches from the stage ; ; STOP
START and the young people should not even be permitted to see UNK till they are old enough to drink strong wine and sit at the public tables STOP
START by the time they reach that age , however , aristotle no longer UNK about the evil influence of UNK STOP
START in UNK analysis of tragedy in the UNK , we find an attempt to UNK the art , to consider only those things proper to it , to discover how it UNK from other arts , and to deal with the effects peculiar to it STOP
START he UNK us , early in the UNK , that all art is `` imitation '' and that all imitation gives pleasure , but he UNK between art in general and poetic art on the basis of the means , manner , and the objects of the imitation STOP
START once the poetic arts are separated from the other forms , he UNK down his famous definition of tragedy , which sets up standards and so UNK direction to the remainder of the work STOP
START a tragedy , by his definition , is an imitation of an action that is serious , of a certain magnitude , and complete in itself STOP
START it should have a dramatic form with UNK language , and it should UNK UNK which so UNK UNK and fear that it UNK these emotions in the audience STOP
START any tragedy , he maintains , has six elements : plot , character , and thought ( the objects of imitation ) , UNK and melody ( the means of imitation ) , and UNK ( the manner of imitation ) STOP
START throughout the rest of the UNK , aristotle continues to discuss the characteristics of these six parts and their UNK , and he refers frequently to the standards suggested by his definition of tragedy STOP
START UNK method in the UNK , then , does suggest that we should UNK the work STOP
START the chicago UNK of modern critics follow aristotle so far in this direction that it is hard to see how they can compare one poem with another for the purpose of evaluation STOP
START but there are , however , several features of UNK approach which open the way for the moral measure of literature STOP
START for one thing , aristotle UNK that plays may UNK the audience STOP
START in addition , his definition of a tragedy UNK our attention , because a serious and important action may very well be one that tests the moral fiber of the author or of the characters STOP
START and there is one other point in the UNK that UNK moral evaluation : UNK notion that the distinctive function of tragedy is to UNK one's emotions by UNK UNK and fear STOP
START he UNK certain UNK because they do not contribute to that end STOP
START the point is that an ethical critic , with an assist from UNK , can UNK on this theory to argue that tragedy provides us with a UNK UNK for our hostile UNK STOP
START in his study samuel UNK , joseph wood UNK takes this line when he says that what aristotle really means by his theory of UNK is that our evil passions may be so UNK by the dramatic ritual that it is `` less likely that we shall UNK them through our own acts '' STOP
START in UNK view , this is one way to show how literature may be moral in effect without UNK the explicit methods of a UNK STOP
START and we can add that UNK interpretation of UNK is also one answer to plato's fear that poetry will encourage our passions STOP
START if UNK is correct , tragedy may have quite the opposite effect STOP
START it may UNK our passions and so UNK the rule of reason STOP
START or in more UNK terms , the experience may serve to UNK our destructive UNK and UNK the UNK and UNK STOP
START UNK and UNK STOP
START the second half of the UNK century in england was the setting for a violent and long controversy over the moral quality of renaissance literature , especially the drama STOP
START no one suggested that the ethical effects of the art were UNK STOP
START both sides agreed that the theater must stand a moral test , but they could not agree on whether the poets were a good or a bad influence STOP
START both sides claimed that plato and aristotle supported their cause STOP
START those who wanted to close the UNK , for example , pointed to plato's republic and those who wished to keep them open called on the plato of the UNK to UNK in their behalf STOP
START the most famous UNK that comes out of this dispute is perhaps sir UNK UNK an UNK for UNK , published in UNK STOP
START many students of literature know that classical defense STOP
START what is not so well known , however , and what is quite important for understanding the issues of this early quarrel , is the kind of attack on literature that UNK was UNK STOP
START for this reason , then i want to describe , first , two examples of the UNK UNK : UNK UNK the school of UNK , UNK , and his later UNK UNK , published in UNK STOP
START second , we will see how UNK answered the charges , for while UNK essay was not specifically a UNK to UNK , his UNK do support the new theater STOP
START according to william UNK study , UNK UNK , the theater business in london had become a UNK enterprise by UNK , and , in the opinion of many , a thoroughly bad business STOP
START aroused by what they considered an evil influence , some members of the clergy , joined by city authorities , merchants , and master UNK , began the attack on the plays and the UNK for what they called `` the UNK of the art '' , but by UNK some of them began to UNK the whole idea of acting STOP
START although this kind of UNK objection came at first from some men who were not UNK UNK , still , once the UNK gained power , they UNK the affair by passing the UNK UNK of UNK which UNK that all `` public UNK shall cease and be UNK '' STOP
START with that act of parliament the UNK of the stage won the day , and for more than two decades after that england had no legitimate public drama STOP
START in the early days of this controversy over the theater one of the interested parties , UNK UNK , published a little UNK in which he UNK UNK to the UNK of art , rather than the art itself STOP
START but his opposition UNK and by UNK , in the school of UNK , he was ready to UNK all `` players '' STOP
START he UNK women to UNK `` of those places which in UNK UNK you and UNK you in UNK '' STOP
START he does not really UNK of UNK and UNK , but sex is the deadly sin STOP
START he UNK that a single glance can lead us into UNK , for `` looking UNK have UNK UNK , and UNK UNK may UNK in UNK '' STOP
START but it would not be very satisfactory to leave our conclusions at the point just reached STOP
START fortunately , it is possible to be somewhat more concrete and UNK in UNK the involvement of values in education STOP
START for this purpose we now draw upon data from UNK and psychological studies of students in american colleges and universities , and particularly from the UNK values studies STOP
START in the latter research program , information is available for UNK UNK students UNK in 1950 and for UNK students UNK in 1952 STOP
START of the latter sample , UNK persons had been studied two years earlier ; ; STOP
START hence changes in attitudes and values can be analyzed for identical individuals at two points in time STOP
START in addition , the 1952 study collected comparable data from UNK students at ten other colleges and universities scattered across the country : dartmouth , harvard , yale , UNK , north carolina , UNK , texas , university of california at los angeles , UNK , and michigan STOP
START we find , in the first place , that the students UNK UNK of higher education , UNK evaluate the job their own institution is doing , do not accept most of the UNK UNK against higher education in the public UNK , and , on the whole , UNK of the way their university deals with UNK and value UNK STOP
START it is not our impression that these UNK are UNK UNK UNK of UNK ignorance ; ; STOP
START rather , the UNK of these students find their university experience UNK to their own sense of values STOP
START students are approximately equally divided between those who regard vocational preparation as the primary goal of an ideal education and those who chose a general liberal education STOP
START other UNK goals , such as UNK and social adjustment , are of secondary importance to them STOP
START the ideal of a liberal education UNK itself upon the students more and more as they move through college STOP
START even in such technical UNK as engineering , the senior is much more likely than the UNK to choose , as an ideal , liberal education over specific vocational preparation STOP
START in the university UNK of scholarship and research , of social diversity , of new ideas and varied and UNK interests , `` UNK '' into a campus culture apparently means UNK appreciation of the idea of a liberal education in the arts and sciences STOP
START UNK UNK of ideal educational goals are not arbitrary or UNK STOP
START there is a clear relationship between their educational UNK and their basic pattern of general values STOP
START the selective and UNK qualities of basic UNK are clearly evident in these data : the `` UNK '' students choose vocational preparation , the `` UNK '' choose goals of social adjustment ( `` getting along with people '' ) , the `` UNK '' choose a liberal arts emphasis STOP
START the same UNK consistency shows itself in occupational UNK STOP
START there is impressive consistency between specific occupational UNK and the UNK basic conception of what is for him a good way of life STOP
START and , contrary to many popular UNK , the UNK chosen do not seem to us to be primarily UNK to UNK success nor to mere conformity STOP
START our students want UNK that permit them to use their talents and training , to be creative and original , to work with and to help other people STOP
START they also want money , prestige , and security STOP
START but they are optimistic about their prospects in these UNK ; ; STOP
START they set limits to their aspirations -- few UNK to millions of dollars or to `` UNK '' power and glory STOP
START within the fixed frame of these aspirations , they can afford to place a high value on the UNK and UNK aspects of occupation and to minimize the UNK values of power , prestige , and wealth STOP
START occupational UNK are also useful -- and interesting -- in bringing out clearly that values do not constitute the only component in goals and aspirations STOP
START for there is also the `` face of reality '' in the form of the individual's UNK of his own abilities and interests , of the objective possibilities open to him , of the UNK and other social pressures to which he is exposed STOP
START we find `` UNK UNK '' whose values are not in line with their expected UNK characteristics STOP
START students develop occupational images -- not always accurate or detailed -- and they try to fit their values to the UNK characteristics of the UNK occupation STOP
START the purely UNK or UNK problems are often UNK STOP
START furthermore , many UNK UNK are UNK to social demands , or UNK in the face of their own limitations of opportunity , or of ability and performance STOP
START thus , many a UNK UNK for a career in UNK , drama , or UNK , UNK himself to a real estate business ; ; STOP
START many a UNK student who dreams of the UNK to enter his father's advertising agency ; ; STOP
START and many a UNK UNK business executive UNK it were better to teach the theory of business administration than to practice it STOP
START the old ideal of the independent UNK is UNK -- but so is the recognition that the main chance may be in a corporate UNK STOP
START in their views on UNK , UNK , sex , and family life , our students prefer what they are expected to prefer STOP
START for them , in the UNK words of a UNK song , love and marriage go together like a horse and UNK STOP
START their expressed standards concerning sex roles , desirable age for marriage , characteristics of an ideal mate , number of children desired are UNK with the values and UNK of the preceding generation -- UNK UNK UNK STOP
START they even accept the `` double standard '' of sex morality in a double sense , i.e, both UNK agree that standards for men differ from standards for women , and women apply to both UNK a standard different from that held by men STOP
START `` UNK '' and `` UNK '' seem implied by what has just been said STOP
START but these terms are UNK STOP
START in the field of political values , it is certainly true that students are not radical , not UNK against their parents or their UNK STOP
START and as they go through college , the students tend to bring their political position in line with that UNK in the social groups to which they belong STOP
START yet they have accepted most of the UNK `` welfare state '' provisions for health , security , and the regulation of economic affairs , and they UNK UNK of the traditional `` liberalism '' of the bill of rights STOP
START when their faith in civil UNK is tested against strong pressures of social UNK in specific issues , e.g, UNK of `` dangerous ideas '' , many UNK and give in STOP
START the students who are most willing to UNK in the UNK of civil UNK are also those who are most likely to be UNK against minority groups , to be UNK and UNK in general social attitudes , and to lack a basic faith in people STOP
START as one looks at the existing evidence , one finds a correlation , although only a slight one , between high grades and `` UNK '' values STOP
START but the correlation is substantial only among UNK STOP
START in other words , as students go through college , those who are most successful UNK tend to become more committed to a `` bill of rights '' orientation STOP
START college in gross -- just the general experience -- may have varying effects , but the students who are successful emerge with UNK and UNK democratic values STOP
START this finding is consistent also with the fact that student leaders are more likely to be UNK of the values UNK in civil UNK than the other students STOP
START there is now substantial evidence from several major studies of college students that the experience of the college years results in a certain , selective UNK of attitudes and values STOP
START UNK from their prior UNK and social groups and exposed to the UNK UNK of the university UNK , the students tend to UNK a new common culture , to UNK toward norms characteristic of their own particular campus STOP
START furthermore , in certain respects , there are norms common to colleges and universities across the country STOP
START for instance , UNK people consistently show up in study after study as more often than others UNK of the bill of rights and other democratic rights and UNK STOP
START the interesting thing in this connection is that the norms upon which students tend to UNK include UNK of diversity STOP
START to the extent that our sampling of the UNK of american college students in the years 1950 and 1952 may be representative of our culture -- and still valid in 1959 -- we are disposed to question the summary UNK of the current generation as UNK , beat , UNK , or as a mass of UNK UNK who are guided solely by social radar without benefit of inner UNK STOP
START our data indicate that these students of today do basically accept the existing institutions of the society , and , in the face of the realities of complex and UNK economic and political problems , make a UNK and UNK UNK of trust to those who occupy positions of UNK responsibility for UNK with such collective concerns STOP
START in a real sense they are UNK conservative , but their UNK UNK a UNK UNK of the original `` UNK '' of UNK STOP
START although we have no measures of its strength or intensity , the heritage of the doctrine of UNK rights is retained STOP
START as they move through the college years our young men and women are `` UNK '' into a UNK similar culture , at the level of personal behavior STOP
START in this sense also , they are surely UNK STOP
START it is even true that some among them use the UNK fact of conformity -- `` everyone does it '' -- as a UNK for conduct STOP
START but the extent of ethical UNK is easily UNK STOP
START few students are really so UNK in the UNK crowd of the UNK population in our institutions of higher learning STOP
START and it may be well to recall that to say `` conformity '' is , in part , another way of saying `` UNK human society '' STOP
START in the field of religious beliefs and values , the college students seem to UNK reflect the surrounding culture STOP
START their commitments are , for the most part , UNK in a familiar UNK STOP
START students UNK to a felt need for a religious faith or ultimate personal philosophy STOP
START UNK UNK or UNK are so rare as to be a UNK STOP
START the religious quest is often intense and deep , and there are students on every campus who are seriously UNK with the most profound questions of meaning and value STOP
START at the same time , a major proportion of these young men and women see religion as a means of personal adjustment , an UNK for family life , a source of emotional security STOP
START these personal and social goals often UNK the goals of intellectual clarity , and spiritual UNK STOP
START the `` UNK of adjustment '' does exist STOP
START it exists UNK the acceptance of traditional forms of organized religion ( church , UNK personnel , ritual , UNK ) STOP
START still another UNK of the student population consists of those who seek , in what they regard as religion , intellectual clarity , rational belief , and ethical guidance and UNK STOP
START our first impression of the data was that the students were surprisingly orthodox and UNK involved STOP
START upon second thought we were forced to realize that we have very few reliable historical UNK against which we might compare the present situation , and that conclusions that present-day students are `` more '' or `` less '' religious could not be defended on the basis of our data STOP
START as we looked more UNK at the content of our belief and the extent of religious participation , we received the impression that many of the religious convictions expressed represented a conventional acceptance , of low intensity STOP
START but , here again , comparative UNK are lacking , and we do not know , in any case , what measure of UNK and intensity to expect from healthy , young , secure and relatively UNK persons ; ; STOP
START after all , feelings of immortality and UNK are standard UNK of youth STOP
START nor are optimistic and UNK UNK at all rare in the distinctive religious history of this country STOP
START UNK recently has UNK evidence regarding changes in values during a period of years , primarily UNK , but extending much farther back in some instances STOP
START a variety of data are assembled to bear upon such UNK changes as UNK UNK morality , UNK UNK , individualism , achievement , UNK emphasis on UNK orientation in favor of UNK , moral UNK , consideration and UNK , conformity , UNK UNK orientation STOP
START although he questions the extent and nature of the UNK UNK of religion and the UNK increase in conformity , and UNK that `` UNK '' UNK orientation does not have the meaning usually attributed to it , he does conclude that americans increasingly enjoy UNK without guilt , do not stress achievement so much as formerly , are more accepting of group harmony as a goal , more UNK of diversity and aware of other cultures STOP
START from new UNK , morgan UNK to the headquarters of washington at UNK , pennsylvania , arriving there on november UNK STOP
START there was much UNK in the corps , and the men were , in addition , without the clothing , UNK , and UNK needed for the winter weather STOP
START morgan himself had UNK again STOP
START even on his tough constitution , the exposure and UNK activity were beginning to tell in earnest STOP
START on the morning of november UNK , UNK and UNK men had left philadelphia with the object of UNK fort mercer at red bank , new UNK STOP
START in order to prevent this , washington UNK to UNK several units to UNK the fort , including a force under the UNK de UNK containing some UNK of UNK UNK , all who were fit for duty at this time , the rest having no UNK STOP
START although the fort was UNK in the face of the force of UNK , morgan and his men did have a chance to take another UNK at the UNK STOP
START a UNK guard of about UNK , mostly UNK , were attacked by the americans under UNK , and driven back to their camp , some twenty to thirty of them falling before the UNK fire STOP
START `` i never saw men '' , UNK declared in regard to the UNK , `` so UNK , so UNK , and so UNK to go on to the enemy , whatever force they might have , as that small party in this fight '' STOP
START UNK greene told washington that `` UNK was UNK with the UNK behavior of the UNK and UNK '' STOP
START a few days later it was learned that general howe was planning an attack upon the american camp STOP
START the british general moved his forces north from philadelphia to UNK hill , near the right UNK of the UNK UNK STOP
START here the pennsylvania UNK UNK with the british , but soon fled STOP
START morgan was ordered to attack the enemy , who had UNK moved to edge hill on the left of the americans STOP
START similar orders were given to the maryland UNK STOP
START morgan immediately disposed his troops for action and found he had not long to wait STOP
START a body of UNK were seen UNK down a nearby slope , a UNK target for the UNK , who UNK a UNK into their UNK and `` UNK up '' the UNK formation considerably STOP
START now the UNK and the UNK followed up their beginning and closed in on the british , giving them another telling round of fire STOP
START the UNK ran like UNK STOP
START but the maryland UNK had likewise fled , all too typical of this type of soldier during the revolution , an experience which gave morgan little confidence in UNK in general , as he watched other instances of their breaking in hot UNK STOP
START the british , although suffering considerable losses , noted the UNK of the UNK , made a stand , then turned and attacked morgan who became greatly UNK and had to UNK STOP
START the americans lost UNK men , among them major joseph UNK of UNK regiment , an officer who was regarded with high UNK and affection , not only by his commander , but by washington and UNK as well STOP
START the latter was so UNK on learning of the death of UNK , that he wrote morgan a letter , showing his own UNK UNK STOP
START after UNK morgan and the UNK and saying he was UNK them to congress , too , the UNK UNK added he felt that congress should make some financial UNK to the UNK and family of UNK , but that he knew morgan realized how long such action usually required , if it was done at all STOP
START `` as UNK may be in some want before that time '' , UNK continued , `` i am going to trouble you with a commission which i UNK you will UNK with the greatest UNK STOP
START if she wanted to UNK any sum of money in UNK the arrangements of congress , it would not become a UNK , unknown to her , to offer himself for that purpose STOP
START but you could ( as from yourself ) tell her that you had friends who , being with the army , don't know what to do with their money and would UNK let her have one or many thousand dollars '' STOP
START this was accordingly done , and the UNK of the UNK UNK was much relieved as a result of the generous loan , the amount of which is not known STOP
START apparently still sensitive about the idea with which general gates had approached him at UNK , namely , that george washington be replaced , morgan was UNK in his support of the UNK during the campaign around philadelphia STOP
START richard UNK , secretary of the board of war , thought morgan was so extreme on the subject that he accused him of trying to pick a quarrel STOP
START morgan UNK denied this and informed the board of war that the men in camp linked the name of UNK with the plot against washington STOP
START UNK insisted that this impression was a great UNK , and evidently , from the quarrel , obtained an UNK impression of UNK judgment STOP
START such a situation regarding the board of war could hardly have helped UNK UNK for promotion when that matter came before the group later on STOP
START in late december , the american army moved from UNK to valley UNK , and although the distance was only 13 miles , the journey took more than a week because of the bad weather , the UNK and almost naked men STOP
START the position of the new camp was UNK selected and well UNK , its easily UNK nature being one good reason why howe did not attack it STOP
START besides helping to prevent the movement of the british to the west , valley UNK also UNK the trade between UNK forces and the farmers , thus threatening the vital UNK of the UNK and UNK their UNK to obtain necessary supplies extremely UNK STOP
START in order to see that this UNK situation remained effective , washington UNK several bodies of his troops to the UNK of the philadelphia area STOP
START morgan and his corps were placed on the west side of the UNK river , with instructions to UNK all supplies found going to the city and to keep a close eye on the movements of the enemy STOP
START the headquarters of morgan was on a farm , said to have been particularly well located so as to prevent the farmers nearby from trading with the british , a practice all too common to those who preferred to sell their produce for british gold rather than the virtually UNK UNK UNK STOP
START in his UNK with UNK , however , morgan was typically firm but just STOP
START for example , he captured some persons from york county , who with teams were taking to philadelphia the furniture of a man who had just been released from prison through the efforts of his wife , and who apparently was helpless to prevent the UNK of his household goods STOP
START morgan took charge of the furniture and UNK it to its UNK owners , but he let the UNK who had UNK it go free STOP
START morgan complained to washington about the men detailed to him for UNK duty , most of them he said being UNK STOP
START `` they UNK at such a rate '' , he told the UNK , `` that if the enemy were UNK , they might get two from us , when we would take one of them , which makes me wish general howe would go on , UNK any incident happen to us '' STOP
START if the UNK of the winter at valley UNK were trying for healthy men , they were , of course , much more so for those not in good health STOP
START UNK UNK UNK condition UNK with the increase of the cold and UNK weather STOP
START he had UNK the elements and the enemy , but the strain , UNK by the winter , was UNK up with him at last STOP
START also , he was now UNK years old STOP
START the UNK activity of his command during the UNK of the troops at valley UNK could be handled by a UNK , he felt , so like henry UNK , equally UNK to washington , who went to boston at this time , morgan received permission to visit his home in virginia for several weeks STOP
START in his absence , the rifle regiment was under the command of major thomas UNK , another able UNK STOP
START but morgan did not leave before he had written a letter to a william UNK in salem , massachusetts , apparently an UNK , UNK washington and saying that the UNK UNK about him were `` opposed by the general current of the people to UNK general gates at the expense of general washington was UNK to the latter STOP
START if there be a UNK UNK in america , UNK general washington , and his UNK , none can question '' STOP
START it is doubtful if morgan was able to take home much money to his wife and children , for his pay , as shown by the war department UNK of early UNK was UNK a month as a colonel , and that apt to be delayed STOP
START he was shown a warm welcome regardless , and spent the time in UNK UNK from his UNK , UNK his family and UNK his private affairs which were , of course , run down STOP
START his neighbors UNK his return , even if it was only temporary , and morgan was especially UNK by the UNK expression of an UNK friend , UNK lane , who told him , `` a man that has so often left all that is dear to him , as UNK UNK , to serve thy country , must create a sympathetic feeling in every UNK heart '' STOP
START there must have been special feelings of joy and UNK in the heart of UNK morgan too , when the news was received on april UNK of the recognition by france of the independence of the united states STOP
START his fellow UNK , george washington , had stated , `` i believe no event was ever received with more UNK joy '' STOP
START the UNK camp at valley UNK was turned into an UNK of UNK STOP
START even the UNK washington UNK in a game of UNK with some children STOP
START his soldiers on the whole did not UNK so UNK STOP
START on may UNK , morgan , who had returned , received from washington orders to `` send out UNK under UNK officers '' to keep near the enemy STOP
START `` the reason for this '' , the orders said , `` is that the enemy may think to take advantage of the UNK of this day STOP
START the troops must have more than the common quantity of liquor , and perhaps there will be some little UNK among them '' STOP
START apparently no serious UNK resulted from the UNK , and within a few days , morgan joined the force of UNK who now had command of some UNK men at UNK hill , not far above philadelphia on the UNK STOP
START the UNK had been ordered to approach the UNK lines , UNK them and get intelligence of their movements STOP
START UNK enough , the order UNK to morgan through alexander hamilton also informed him that `` a party of indians will join the party to be sent from your command at UNK , and act with them '' STOP
START these were UNK indians STOP
START washington evidently was anxious for morgan to be UNK as well as aggressive , for on may UNK , UNK and UNK he UNK the leader of the UNK to be on the alert STOP
START obviously the UNK had confidence that morgan would furnish him good intelligence too , for on the UNK of may , he told morgan that the british were prepared to move , perhaps in the night , and asked morgan to have two of his best horses ready to UNK to general UNK with the intelligence obtained STOP
START UNK , however , this same general UNK seemed to be serving UNK as well as the american army STOP
START colonel UNK UNK wrote to morgan from UNK that he understood a UNK from maryland had obtained permission from UNK to visit philadelphia , and would return on may UNK , UNK by several officers from maryland `` UNK to the new UNK in the british service '' STOP
START UNK urged morgan to capture these men , who , he thought , might be UNK as UNK or UNK STOP
START morgan took the suggested steps , but when UNK appeared , there was nobody with her but her husband , whom he promptly sent to headquarters to be questioned STOP
START but morgan evidently reported matters of intelligence much more important to his UNK general STOP
START a letter of a few days later from UNK UNK to morgan stated , `` his UNK is highly pleased with your conduct upon this occasion '' STOP
START for by now the original cause of the quarrel , UNK UNK of UNK , was only one UNK in the UNK UNK of french interests that UNK all western europe and that had been so well and closely UNK that the UNK movement could set it UNK from one end to the other STOP
START even so , UNK UNK can scarcely have UNK that five years of UNK work lay ahead of them before peace was finally made and that when it did come the UNK UNK that left england for rome during that period had very little to do with it STOP
START it is hard not to lay most of the UNK for their UNK on the pope STOP
START UNK is hardly an UNK witness , and even he did not make his charges against UNK until the latter was dead , but there is some truth in what he said and more in what he did not say STOP
START it was not merely a hunger for `` money , gold and precious objects '' that delayed the UNK UNK that could have brought the war to an end ; ; STOP
START the pope was playing a dangerous game , with so many UNK in the air at once that a UNK would bring them all about his ears , and his only hope was to UNK so that he could take advantage of every change in the UNK balance of european affairs STOP
START when the UNK began , his quarrel with the king of france was temporarily in UNK , and he had no intention of UNK it so long as there was hope that french money would come to pay the troops who , under charles of UNK , the UNK UNK of UNK , were so valuable in the UNK against the UNK UNK and their UNK allies STOP
START if his UNK in regard to UNK UNK went so far that he even refused to grant a UNK for the marriage of UNK daughter , UNK , to the son of the UNK of UNK -- a truly UNK move according to UNK ideas , for UNK and UNK were as usual fighting on opposite sides -- for fear that he might seem to be UNK the UNK UNK , he would certainly never take the far more UNK step of ordering the return of UNK to edward , even though , as he admitted to the english UNK , he had been advised that the original UNK was UNK STOP
START on the other hand , he did not want to UNK edward either , and he found himself in a very difficult position STOP
START on the surface , the whole question was purely UNK STOP
START the french were now UNK UNK and UNK on the technical grounds that their UNK had UNK them by a UNK of the UNK contract STOP
START but edward was UNK UNK for precisely the same reason , and his UNK UNK was the UNK of the king of france STOP
START UNK had to UNK the UNK of the UNK contract at all costs , for it was only as UNK of UNK and of the UNK of peter that he had any justification for his italian wars , but in the UNK UNK it was almost impossible for him to recognize the claims of any one of the UNK without UNK to UNK those of the other two STOP
START because of these UNK in the matter at UNK , UNK lacked the UNK that is supposed to be an essential UNK for the position of UNK , and in UNK that would seem to be sufficient reason why the english UNK to the UNK proved so UNK STOP
START but when the situation was so complicated that even UNK , one of the principal UNK in the drama , could UNK the UNK motives , it is possible that UNK and his UNK , equally UNK , attributed their difficulties to a more immediate cause STOP
START this was UNK UNK UNK STOP
START `` UNK '' , by its very UNK , implies that its UNK UNK in touch with other people , but the author of UNK UNK and UNK UNK , the UNK of the two UNK , the UNK sun of which the UNK moon was but a UNK reflection , the UNK of UNK and UNK of christ , was so high above other human beings that he had forgotten what they were like STOP
START he was a learned and brilliant man , one of the best UNK in europe and with UNK of UNK insight , and yet in his UNK with other people , particularly when he tried to be UNK , he was capable of an UNK UNK that can have come only from a complete UNK of human nature and human motives STOP
START this UNK UNK for others was not shared by such men as UNK UNK and his UNK , that `` brilliant group of UNK men '' , as UNK calls them , who provided the UNK for the french embassy that came to rome under the UNK leadership of the UNK of UNK , the UNK of UNK , and the count of UNK STOP
START they had UNK from humble UNK by their own UNK and UNK , they were UNK by the codes that bound UNK like UNK or even the older generation of UNK like UNK , and they were working for an end that their UNK had never even UNK STOP
START UNK was later to explain to the english that robert of UNK and UNK de UNK were easy enough to do business with ; ; STOP
START it was the UNK who caused the UNK and who made him say that the ruling passion of their race was UNK and that in dealing with them he never knew whether he had to do with a UNK or with a devil STOP
START to the pope , head of the universal church , to the UNK of UNK , taking full advantage of his position on the UNK of france and of the empire , or to UNK , who found it quite natural that he should do UNK to edward for UNK and to the count of UNK for UNK , UNK UNK nationalism was completely UNK STOP
START and yet he made no UNK about it ; ; STOP
START when the pope , trying no doubt to appeal to his better nature , said to him , `` you have already taken UNK STOP
START do you want to drive the king of england from all his overseas UNK '' ? ? STOP
START the UNK answer was a UNK `` UNK UNK UNK '' STOP
START UNK and UNK , with a UNK UNK to which he devoted all his energies , he UNK the english UNK time and time again until , by a kind of poetic justice , he fell at the battle of UNK , the victim of the equally UNK if less UNK UNK STOP
START the english , UNK on a UNK UNK and confronted with superior diplomatic skill , were also UNK in their UNK by the events that were taking place at home STOP
START the UNK had found a new leader in william UNK , and UNK UNK UNK across the UNK called for UNK taxes , which only increased his difficulties with the UNK and the clergy STOP
START he was unable to send any more help to his allies on the UNK , and during the next few years many of them , left to resist french pressure UNK , UNK to the inevitable and made their peace with UNK STOP
START the defeat and death of UNK of UNK at the hands of albert of UNK also worked to the UNK of the english , for all the efforts to UNK the UNK UNK came to nothing when UNK made an alliance with the new king of the UNK STOP
START these shifts in alliance and UNK not only increased the difficulties UNK the english embassy as a whole , but also directly involved the two UNK , UNK and UNK STOP
START in spite of the UNK UNK by UNK two years earlier , the war between UNK UNK of UNK and UNK of UNK was still going on , and although little is known about it , that little UNK that it was yet another phase of the struggle against french expansion and was closely UNK with the larger conflict STOP
START a second UNK had been UNK in april , UNK , by UNK UNK , lord of UNK , the most UNK of UNK UNK allies , and these last were represented in the discussions at the UNK by UNK de UNK , UNK UNK and a member of the UNK UNK STOP
START but although in many of these discussions UNK and UNK might have been UNK to consider their own interests as well as those of the king , UNK confidence in them was so absolute that they were made the UNK leaders of the embassy STOP
START UNK may have UNK this partly to his relationship with the king , but UNK , who at UNK seems still to have been a simple knight , UNK his position solely by his own character and ability STOP
START the younger men , UNK , and UNK , who was also UNK UNK and whose UNK blood gave him the UNK UNK that caused edward of UNK UNK friend , UNK UNK , to UNK him `` joseph the jew '' , were relatively new to the game of UNK , but UNK had been on missions to rome before , and UNK , a man of great learning , `` UNK in speech , UNK to meet , of honest religion , and UNK in the eyes of all '' , and an UNK to UNK , was as reliable and experienced as UNK himself STOP
START but all the reports of this first embassy show that the two UNK were the heads of it , for they were the only ones who were UNK to UNK for the king that he would UNK by the UNK decision and who were allowed to UNK UNK in the event that one was UNK absent STOP
START this also gave them the UNK duty of being UNK for the mission , and they could UNK that that would not be easy STOP
START UNK all the UNK phrases of royal and UNK letters and behind the more UNK instructions to the UNK was the UNK fact that edward would have to desert his UNK allies and leave them to the UNK of their UNK UNK , the king of france , in return for being given an equally free hand with the UNK UNK STOP
START this was a UNK bitter UNK to the king STOP
START in the eyes of those who still UNK for such things , it was a reflection on his honor , and it gave further grounds for UNK to his UNK subjects , who were already UNK -- although probably not in latin -- `` UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK sit UNK UNK '' STOP
START bad relations between england and UNK brought hard times to the UNK scattered over the UNK and UNK as well as to the UNK UNK cities , and while the english , so far , had done no more than UNK , UNK had seen what the UNK might lead to , for before he left the low countries the citizens of UNK had UNK in protest against the expense of supporting edward and his troops , and the regular soldiers had found it UNK difficult to put down the UNK little UNK that UNK STOP
START in all the talk of UNK rights , the UNK and UNK must never forget the UNK , nor was it easy to do so , for all along the road to italy they passed the UNK pack UNK going home with their UNK of raw UNK from england and rough UNK cloth , the former to be UNK and UNK by the UNK UNK UNK and the latter to be UNK and UNK by the UNK UNK UNK with the UNK recently discovered in asia minor by one of their members , UNK UNK , the secret of which they UNK kept for themselves STOP

START alfred walked past him without a word and got into the car STOP
START harry ran to the side of the car where alfred was sitting and looked at him , UNK him to speak STOP
START alfred looked straight ahead STOP
START the car began to move and harry ran after it UNK , `` alfred ! ! STOP
START alfred ! ! STOP
START speak to me '' STOP
START but the car moved off and alfred just looked straight ahead STOP
START harry followed the car until it reached the main road and turned towards UNK STOP
START he stood there watching until it had gone from his sight STOP
START i went to visit alfred in the UNK hospital a few times STOP
START the first time i went there he asked me to bring him water from UNK well -- water that reminded him of his first days in the mountains -- and before i came the next time i filled a UNK UNK for him and brought it to the hospital STOP
START i don't think he ever got to drink any of it STOP
START the UNK stayed at the hospital and the water -- what can happen to water ? ? STOP
START -- it UNK , disappeared , and came back to the earth as rain -- maybe for another well or another stream or another alfred UNK STOP
START 12 `` where is it written '' ? ? STOP
START UNK was always called banks the UNK until he left town and the shop passed over to meltzer the UNK who then became automatically meltzer the UNK STOP
START meltzer was a UNK with the banks family STOP
START he came to UNK directly from the boat that brought him to america from russia STOP
START he was a learned man and a very gentle soul STOP
START he was filled with knowledge of the bible and the UNK STOP
START he knew the UNK and the UNK but he was weak , very weak , on the UNK STOP
START banks the UNK took meltzer the UNK as an apprentice and he made it very clear that a man of learning must be able to do more than just quote the UNK of the UNK in order to live STOP
START so meltzer learned a new trade from banks , who supplied the town and the UNK with meat STOP
START banks had a family -- a wife , a daughter , and a son STOP
START the daughter , UNK , was a very good friend of mine and i always had hopes that UNK she and meltzer would find each other STOP
START they lived in the same house and it didn't seem to be such a hard thing to do , but the sad realities of UNK life and the fact that meltzer didn't love her never satisfied my UNK thinking STOP
START banks the UNK was a hard master and a hard father , a man who didn't seem to know the difference between the living flesh of his family and the UNK UNK of his stock in trade STOP
START he treated both with equal UNK and with equal UNK ; ; STOP
START perhaps he was a little more sympathetic to the sides of beef that hung UNK from his UNK STOP
START UNK banks and i became friends STOP
START she was the opposite of everything she should have been -- a positive UNK in a negative home , a living reaction of UNK and UNK to the UNK reality of her father STOP
START and UNK whole family seemed to be an UNK for UNK STOP
START her brother UNK was a very gentle soul , her mother was a quiet woman who said little but who had hard , UNK eyes STOP
START for every UNK word of UNK the family had five in UNK STOP
START every chance i got i left the hotel to visit UNK STOP
START i was free but she was bound to her duties that not even the coming of meltzer UNK STOP
START she had to clean the glass on the display cases in the UNK shop , help her brother UNK the cutting tables with wire UNK , UNK the UNK , put down new UNK on the UNK and help check the UNK orders STOP
START when these UNK were finished , only then , was she allowed whatever freedom she could find STOP
START i helped UNK in the store STOP
START to me it was a game , to her it was the deadly UNK of life STOP
START i wanted to help so that we could find time to play STOP
START and UNK allowed me to help so that she could have her few little hours of escape STOP
START when the work was finished , we would walk STOP
START the road past the UNK shop took us along the side of a stream STOP
START it ran north , away from the town and the people , through woods and past the UNK of a UNK STOP
START UNK preferred the UNK of that walk STOP
START i would have liked the town and the UNK of its people but i always followed UNK into the peace of the UNK and UNK road STOP
START it wasn't hard to understand STOP
START to me UNK was a fine and lovely girl STOP
START to people who didn't know her she was a UNK , badly UNK UNK whose arms were too long , whose legs were a little too UNK STOP
START she had the UNK of a boy and a UNK walk that reminded me of a string of UNK UNK down the street STOP
START and she had the kind of crossed eyes that UNK STOP
START it was unexpected , unexpected because UNK walked with her head bent down , down , and her mark of friendship was to look into your face STOP
START i accepted her crossed eyes as she accepted my UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK compared to her UNK understanding that life was a punishment for as yet UNK UNK STOP
START we were almost the same age , she was fifteen , i was twelve , and where i felt there was a life to look forward to UNK felt she had had as much of it as was necessary STOP
START when we went for our UNK UNK brother would come along every once in a while STOP
START UNK was an almost exact copy of his father physically and it was strange to see the expected become the unexpected STOP
START this huge UNK played the guitar and he would take it along on our UNK and play for us as we sat alone in the woods or by the stream STOP
START UNK played well and his favorite song was a UNK UNK STOP
START he spoke no german but he could sing it and the words of the song were the only ones he knew in a foreign language STOP
START the song , he said , was called `` the UNK UNK '' , and when he UNK , `` UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK die UNK UNK , '' there was such UNK and such simple UNK that it UNK me STOP
START later , when i was older , i found the song was part of UNK die UNK UNK STOP
START and even hearing it in a concert hall surrounded by hundreds of people the words and the melody would make me a little UNK and i would reach out for my UNK hand STOP
START the brother and sister seemed to be a sort of UNK society , a little UNK of UNK for each other in a hard world STOP
START i felt very UNK to be included in the protection of their company even though i had nothing to be protected from STOP
START the turn of the century , or to be more precise , the two decades UNK and following it , marks a great change in the history of early english scholarship STOP
START at the bottom of this change were great UNK forward in the technical equipment and technical standards of the historian STOP
START in UNK , for example , the contributions of UNK UNK and UNK smith to the various volumes of the UNK county UNK raised the discipline from the status of an UNK UNK to that of the most valuable single tool of the early english historian STOP
START and with the publication of UNK UNK of the anglo-saxon UNK the student was presented with an organized synthesis of the UNK data then known STOP
START what was true for UNK was also true of UNK studies STOP
START the value of UNK in the UNK of early english history had long been recognized STOP
START UNK , in fact , had been UNK UNK for this purpose from the time of UNK UNK STOP
START without a precise knowledge of UNK UNK , however , it is UNK whether their use was not more often a source of confusion and error than anything else STOP
START even in the nineteenth century such accomplished UNK as UNK and guest were led into what now seem UNK errors because of their failure to recognize that modern forms of place names are not necessarily the result of logical UNK development STOP
START it was therefore not until the publication of UNK `` the settlement of the south and east UNK '' , and UNK `` UNK and the english UNK of south britain '' , that a scientific basis for UNK studies was established STOP
START diplomatic is another area for which the UNK of the twentieth century marks the beginning of modern standards of scholarship STOP
START although because of the important achievements of nineteenth century scholars in the field of UNK criticism the advance is not so striking as it was in the case of UNK and UNK , the editorial principles laid down by UNK in his great edition of UNK and in his UNK UNK were a distinct improvement upon those of his UNK and remain UNK upon today STOP
START in sum , it can be said that the techniques and standards of present day have their origin at the turn of the century STOP
START and it is this , particularly the establishment of UNK and UNK studies on a scientific basis , which are immediately pertinent to the saxon shore STOP
START almost inevitably , the first result of this technological revolution was a reaction against the methods and in many cases the conclusions of the oxford school of UNK , UNK and ( particularly ) green regarding the nature of the anglo-saxon UNK of britain STOP
START even before the century was out the UNK of reaction had set in STOP
START charles UNK in the introduction and notes to his UNK edition of UNK UNK some early UNK concerning the `` elaborate UNK '' they raised up over the UNK foundations UNK by the traditional UNK of the UNK STOP
START it was UNK , in fact , who UNK the much quoted remark : `` UNK indeed writes as if he had been present at the landing of the UNK and had watched every step of their subsequent progress '' STOP
START sir henry UNK , writing in UNK , put himself firmly in the UNK tradition by UNK the UNK of the west saxon UNK STOP
START early in the present century , UNK continued the attack with a UNK article against guest STOP
START following him in varying degrees of UNK were UNK , UNK , thomas UNK and UNK STOP
START by UNK , UNK lot could begin an article UNK `` la UNK de la UNK UNK UNK UNK '' with the words , `` UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK la UNK du UNK UNK de la UNK de la UNK STOP
START '' it is also worthy of note that lot cited both UNK and UNK with favor in that article STOP
START it would seem that the wheel had turned full circle STOP
START in fact , modern UNK opinion in the main has not UNK all the way back to the destructive UNK of the first half of the nineteenth century STOP
START although one meets with occasional UNK like UNK or , very recently , arthur UNK the majority of scholars have taken a middle position between the UNK of UNK and UNK STOP
START most now admit that UNK , UNK , UNK and the anglo-saxon UNK cannot be the UNK UNK to early english history that guest , UNK and green thought them to be STOP
START as UNK has remarked : `` the critical methods of the nineteenth century UNK most of this UNK narrative STOP
START on the other hand , the UNK of opinion is that , used with caution and in conjunction with other types of evidence , the native sources still provide a valid rough UNK for the english settlement of southern britain STOP
START as sir charles UNK once said , `` it is no longer UNK to UNK that we can say nothing certain about old english UNK '' STOP
START therefore , in one way UNK and UNK have been UNK STOP
START their conclusions concerning the UNK of the west saxon UNK , the confused UNK of UNK , the UNK of the early positions of the anglo-saxon UNK and the mythological elements contained in UNK are now mostly accepted STOP
START nevertheless , in another way modern historians still labor in the UNK of the oxford school STOP
START for it is their UNK concept of the anglo-saxon UNK rather than UNK UNK approach which UNK the field STOP
START despite the UNK of the traditional accounts on many points of detail , as late as 1948 it was still possible to UNK a massive and comparatively sudden ( beginning in UNK ) UNK of germans as the type of UNK STOP
START at this point , of course , the issue has become complicated by a development UNK by UNK and UNK STOP
START they , however much they were in UNK with the late UNK over the method by which britain was UNK , agreed with them that the end result was the complete UNK of the previous UNK population and civilization STOP
START but beginning , for all practical purposes , with UNK UNK english village community scholars have had to UNK with a theory involving UNK and UNK continuity between roman and anglo-saxon times which is completely at UNK with the UNK concept of the anglo-saxon UNK STOP
START against UNK formidable UNK have taken the field , notably UNK , whose UNK book and beyond was written UNK for this purpose , and sir paul UNK whose the growth of the UNK had a similar aim STOP
START largely due to their efforts the UNK UNK has maintained its position although UNK has always found UNK STOP
START UNK in his english field systems and UNK UNK , UNK and UNK defended in part the UNK UNK while at the present time UNK and UNK UNK seem to fall into the UNK UNK camp STOP
START this is nevertheless a minority view STOP
START most scholars , while willing to accept a survival ( UNK ? ? STOP
START ) of UNK art forms and a considerable proportion of the UNK population , UNK any UNK UNK from UNK britain STOP
START therefore , it is plain that the clear distinctions of the nineteenth century are no longer with us STOP
START in the main stream of historical thinking is a group of scholars , UNK , UNK , sir frank UNK et UNK are in varying degrees UNK of the native traditions of the UNK but who UNK the UNK type of UNK suggested by them STOP
START they , in effect , have UNK the opposing positions of the nineteenth century STOP
START on the other side are the UNK UNK who have taken a UNK UNK from both these schools of nineteenth century thought STOP
START as a group they should be favorable to a concept of gradual UNK UNK although the specialist nature of much of their work , UNK , gray and UNK , tends to UNK their UNK STOP
START those who do have occasion to deal with the UNK in a more general way , like UNK and arthur UNK , are on the side of a gradual and often peaceful UNK penetration into britain STOP
START UNK , in fact , UNK that there were any anglo-saxon UNK at all other than a minor UNK UNK in UNK STOP
START now UNK for a moment some recent developments we can say the saxon shore hypothesis of UNK and UNK has UNK UNK UNK in this century STOP
START it is no longer possible to say that a UNK attitude towards the received accounts of the UNK almost automatically produces a `` shore occupied by '' interpretation STOP
START everyone is more or less UNK and virtually no one has been willing to accept UNK or UNK position on that point STOP
START one reason is , of course , that the new UNK has been willing to maintain the general picture of the UNK as UNK in the traditional sources STOP
START the few scholars who have adopted the `` shore occupied by '' interpretation , UNK , shore , and UNK , have all been UNK UNK STOP
START moreover , they have done so in rather special circumstances STOP
START the primary reason for the UNK of the `` shore occupied by '' UNK has been the UNK and UNK of UNK evidence , the most striking feature of early english studies in this century STOP
START again UNK recent developments , UNK UNK of UNK has stood UNK : `` so far as UNK is concerned , there is not the least warrant for the second ( shore occupied by ) of these theories '' STOP
START even earlier UNK had come to the same conclusion STOP
START what they meant was that there was no evidence to show that the south and east UNK of britain received UNK UNK UNK earlier than some other parts of england STOP
START that is , there was no trace of UNK in britain as early as the late third century , to which time the UNK evidence for the UNK of the saxon shore UNK was beginning to point STOP
START in the face of a clear judgment from UNK , therefore , it became impossible for a time for scholars to UNK the `` shore settled by '' theory STOP
START in recent years , however , a wind of change seems to be blowing through early english historical circles STOP
START the great increase in the amount of UNK activity , and therefore information , in the years immediately UNK and following the second world war has brought to light data which has changed the UNK of the saxon shore dispute STOP
START where there were none fifteen years ago , several scholars currently are UNK their way UNK towards the acceptance of the `` shore occupied by '' position STOP
START we must , therefore , have a look at the new UNK material and UNK the literary and UNK evidence which bears upon the problem STOP
START what exactly are we trying to prove ? ? STOP
START we know that the saxon shore was a UNK of late roman UNK policy ; ; STOP
START in other words its existence belongs to the period of roman britain STOP
START so whenever the UNK finally UNK from the island , the saxon shore disappeared in the first decade of the fifth century STOP
START we also know that the saxon shore as reflected in the UNK was created as a part of the UNK reorganization of britain ( post UNK ) STOP
START my argument is that there was no saxon shore prior to that time even though the UNK had been in existence since the time of UNK STOP
START therefore , what we must prove or UNK is that there were UNK , in the broad sense in which we must UNK the word , in the area of the saxon shore at the time it was called the saxon shore STOP
START that is , we must find UNK in east UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK in the last half of the fourth century STOP
START the problem , in other words , is strictly a UNK one STOP
START in UNK the saxon element on its saxon shore was plainly visible because there the UNK were an UNK element in the population STOP
START in britain , obviously , the UNK and UNK characteristics of the saxon shore region are bound to be saxon STOP
START it is a matter of trying to sort out an earlier UNK saxon element from the later , UNK UNK of anglo-saxon UNK STOP
START this , naturally , will be difficult to do since both the UNK and UNK evidence in this period , with some fortunate exceptions , is UNK for precise UNK purposes STOP
START it might be well to consider the literary evidence first because it can provide us with an answer to one important question ; ; STOP
START namely , is the idea that there were saxon UNK in england at all reasonable ? ? STOP
START to do so , something was necessary beyond UNK because there was little UNK or UNK in the european war ; ; STOP
START it meant instead UNK , dirt , and death STOP
START baker gave UNK wood credit for the UNK of the draft of soldiers ; ; STOP
START from the UNK idea a chain reaction occurred STOP
START wood took the proposal to chief of staff UNK UNK , who passed it on to baker a month before the actual declaration of war against germany STOP
START the secretary of war gave his UNK after studying the history of the draft in the american civil war as well as the british UNK system in world war 1 STOP
START he concluded that selective service would not only prevent the UNK of essential war industries but would avoid the UNK moral effects of the british UNK on UNK only -- `` where the feeling of the people was UNK into a UNK by girls UNK white UNK on UNK young men , UNK preaching hate of the germans , and newspapers UNK enemy UNK to make men UNK out of motives of UNK and UNK '' STOP
START baker took the plan to wilson who said : `` baker , this is plainly right on any ground STOP
START start to prepare the necessary legislation so that if i am obliged to go to congress the bills will be ready for immediate consideration '' STOP
START the result was that by secret agreement draft machinery was actually ready long before the country knew that the device was to take the place of the UNK method which UNK roosevelt UNK STOP
START before the draft act was passed baker had UNK UNK UNK , UNK , and prospective draft board members on the administration of the measure -- and the confidence was kept so well that only one newspaper learned what was going on STOP
START it was baker , working through UNK UNK UNK UNK and major UNK UNK `` old UNK '' ) UNK , who arranged for a secret printing by the million of selective service UNK -- again before the act was passed -- until UNK in the government printing office were full and the basement of the washington post office was UNK to the ceiling STOP
START general UNK proposed that regular army officers select the UNK in cities and towns throughout the nation ; ; STOP
START it was baker who thought of UNK the shock , which UNK always brings to a country , by UNK `` UNK from your neighbors '' for the UNK sergeant , and registration in familiar voting places rather than at military installations STOP
START even so , the draft act encountered rough UNK in its progress through the congress STOP
START democratic speaker UNK clark saw little difference between a UNK and a UNK STOP
START UNK UNK UNK , chairman of the house military affairs committee , UNK to UNK the bill STOP
START democratic floor leader UNK UNK would have no part of the measure STOP
START in the judgment of chief of staff UNK it was UNK that the draft policy of a democratic president , aimed at germany , had to be pushed through the house of representatives by the UNK minority member of the military affairs committee -- a republican jew born in germany ! ! STOP
START he was UNK UNK for whom the chief of staff thought no honor could be too great STOP
START after UNK death in UNK UNK wrote : `` may he rest in peace with the eternal UNK of his adopted country '' STOP
START in spite of powerful opposition the draft act finally passed congress on may 17 , UNK STOP
START in early june ten million young men registered by name and number STOP
START the day passed without incident in spite of the warning of senator james UNK of missouri : `` baker , you will have the streets of our american cities running with blood on registration day '' STOP
START on july 20 , the first drawing of numbers occurred in the senate office building before a distinguished group of UNK and high army officers STOP
START secretary of war baker , UNK , put his hand into a large glass bowl and drew the initial number of those to be called STOP
START it was UNK STOP
START a man in mississippi UNK : `` thanks for drawing UNK -- that's me '' STOP
START he was the first of UNK called to the army through the selective service system STOP
START it was one thing to call men to the colors ; ; STOP
START it was another to house , feed , and train them STOP
START the existing army posts were wholly inadequate STOP
START in a matter of months the war department built UNK camps , each one UNK fifty thousand men -- sixteen were under UNK in the south and sixteen with frame structures in the north STOP
START it was a UNK task ; ; STOP
START a typical UNK in the north had twelve hundred buildings , an UNK system , and twenty-five miles of roads STOP
START at camp UNK in UNK a UNK was built in an hour and a half from timber that had been standing in mississippi forests one week before STOP
START the total operation was a construction project comparable in magnitude with the UNK UNK , but in UNK time was in short supply ; ; STOP
START in three months the army spent UNK as much as had been UNK on the `` big UNK '' in ten years STOP
START in later years UNK UNK was to claim that world war 1 , was the first in american history in which there was great concern for both the health and UNK of our soldiers STOP
START it was the first american war in which the death rate from disease was lower than that from battle , due to the provision of trained medical personnel ( of the UNK officers , UNK were UNK ) , UNK UNK , UNK camp UNK , and adequate hospital facilities STOP
START to the middle of september UNK , there had been fewer than 10,000 UNK from disease in the new army STOP
START this UNK record would have been maintained but for a great and unexpected disaster which struck the world with UNK UNK STOP
START it was the UNK UNK of UNK STOP
START the UNK was UNK known as the `` spanish UNK '' from the UNK UNK of its origin STOP
START the world-wide total of UNK from `` spanish UNK '' was around twenty million ; ; STOP
START in the united states UNK UNK to it STOP
START in UNK UNK , the UNK UNK swept through every american military camp ; ; STOP
START during the UNK UNK attack UNK soldiers died from the disease and the death rate ( formerly 5 per year per UNK men ) increased almost fifty times to 4 per week per UNK men STOP
START in spite of this UNK the final UNK figure from disease in the american army during world war 1 , was 15 per UNK per year , UNK with UNK per UNK per year in the mexican war , and UNK in the american civil war STOP
START both secretary of war baker and secretary of navy UNK devoted much time and effort to the problem of providing reasonably normal and UNK activities in camp for the millions of men who had been removed from their home environment STOP
START their policy ran UNK to the traditional idea that a good UNK was usually a UNK , and that in sex affairs `` UNK passion '' was a proof of UNK STOP
START baker moved first ; ; STOP
START six days after war was declared he appointed UNK UNK chairman of the commission on training camp activities ( the UNK ) STOP
START UNK , a brother of minister harry UNK UNK , was a graduate of UNK , and a member of UNK UNK UNK and the american philosophical association STOP
START his assignment was not a new one because baker had sent him to the mexican UNK in UNK to UNK UNK newspaper stories about lack of discipline , UNK , and UNK disease in american military camps STOP
START UNK had found the installations surrounded by a battery of UNK and houses of UNK , with UNK de UNK from all over the country UNK to san UNK , UNK , and UNK UNK to `` woman the UNK '' STOP
START he also UNK that many officers were UNK to the problem , including UNK general UNK UNK who gave UNK the UNK of `` UNK '' STOP
START on the basis of the long UNK of military history UNK and his UNK assumed that the issue was UNK and that anyone interested in a mission like UNK was an UNK UNK or a UNK STOP
START during the brief mexican venture UNK report to the secretary recommended a definite stand by the war department against the UNK and the UNK of UNK STOP
START the problem involved military necessity as much as morality , for in UNK days UNK disease was a UNK UNK STOP
START UNK insisted that a strong word was needed from washington , and it was immediately UNK STOP
START baker put the `` UNK '' and the UNK out of UNK , ordered the UNK of military officers with local law authorities , and told communities that the troops would be moved unless UNK conditions were UNK STOP
START both baker and UNK knew that a substitute was necessary , that a UNK approach was not the real answer STOP
START they were aware that soldiers went to town , in more ways than one , because of the UNK of camp life , to find the only release available in the absence of movies , reading rooms , and playing fields with adequate athletic equipment STOP
START both knew that when UNK stopped at UNK UNK UNK soldiers would sometimes enter to ask the UNK if they had any reading material to spare , even a newspaper STOP
START there was no time in the short mexican encounter to UNK a solution but the area provided a UNK ground for new UNK in the near future STOP
START when the united states entered the first world war baker made certain that the draft act of UNK UNK the sale of liquor to men in uniform and that it provided for broad UNK around the camps in which UNK was UNK STOP
START even so UNK , as the new chairman of the commission on training camp activities , encountered strong and UNK opposition STOP
START new orleans had a UNK UNK district extending over UNK city blocks , and the UNK UNK of the city UNK to washington to present the case for `` the UNK right of men to be men '' STOP
START in europe , UNK UNK , showing his animal UNK as the `` UNK of france '' , asked UNK by letter for the creation of special houses where the sexual desires of american men could be satisfied STOP
START when UNK showed the letter to baker his negative response was : `` for god's sake , UNK , don't show this to the president or UNK stop the war '' STOP
START ultimately UNK `` fit to fight '' UNK swept across the country and every well-known UNK district in the united states was closed , a hundred and ten of them STOP
START the result was that the rate of UNK disease in the american army was the UNK in our military history STOP
START this was the negative side of the situation STOP
START UNK baker worked on the UNK that `` young men UNK prefer to be UNK , and that opportunities for UNK recreation are the best possible cure for UNK in conduct which arise from UNK and the UNK UNK '' STOP
START the UNK activities were to be provided by many organizations including the UNK , the UNK of UNK , the jewish welfare board , the american UNK association , and the UNK and recreation association -- private societies which UNK performed the job that was taken over almost entirely by the special services division of the army itself in world war 2 STOP
START over these voluntary agencies , in UNK , the UNK served as a UNK body in carrying out what survey called `` the most UNK piece of social work in modern times '' STOP
START under UNK the first executive officer of the UNK was richard UNK , whose name in later years was to become UNK with activities at the UNK UNK STOP
START from the point of view of popularity the UNK member of the commission was walter camp , the yale UNK whose UNK was `` the father of american UNK '' STOP
START he was placed in charge of UNK , and among other things adapted the type of UNK known as the daily dozen STOP
START the UNK program of activities was UNK : william UNK and mary UNK on the screen , UNK UNK and harry UNK on the stage , books provided by the american UNK association , full equipment for games and sports -- except that no `` bones '' were furnished for the UNK favorite UNK played on any floor and known as `` african UNK '' STOP
START the UNK distributed a UNK UNK that provided the UNK for UNK UNK of the UNK found UNK , plus a number of others whose UNK were more UNK -- from `` johnny get your gun '' to `` keep the home UNK burning '' to `` UNK from UNK '' STOP

START it is not between UNK and shakespeare that the western mind turns away from the ancient tragic sense of life STOP

START when the historian UNK a situation in which he can perceive no visible cause and effect sequence , he should be alert to intuition and unconscious UNK as possible UNK STOP
START adams firmly contended that the historian must never UNK the impact of the geographical environment on history STOP
START here was another indispensable tool STOP
START indeed , he concluded that `` geographical conditions have exercised a great , possibly a UNK , influence over man's destiny '' STOP
START the failure of greece to reach the UNK destiny that UNK UNK had seemed to promise was almost directly UNK to her physical UNK STOP
START all areas of history were either favorably or UNK affected by the geographical environment , and no respectable historian could pursue the study of history without a thorough knowledge of UNK STOP
START UNK adams was consistent in his UNK to historians about the necessary tools or insights they needed to possess STOP
START however , as a UNK historian , he , himself , has left few UNK to the amount of professional scholarship that he used when writing history STOP
START in fact , if judgments are to be rendered upon the UNK of his UNK , they must be based on UNK evidence STOP
START what evidence is available would seem to indicate that UNK , unlike his older brother henry , had most of the UNK UNK usually found in the amateur STOP
START a UNK , a UNK for UNK , an UNK UNK on contemporary accounts , and a UNK to assume a theory as true before adequate proof was provided were all UNK of his failure to UNK the use of the scientific method or to evaluate the responsibilities of the historian to his reading public STOP
START this is not to assume that his work was without merit , but the validity of his assumptions concerning the meaning of history must always be considered against this background of an UNK approach STOP
START his UNK is perhaps best illustrated in his introduction to the emancipation of massachusetts , which UNK to examine the trials of UNK and to draw a parallel between the leader of the UNK UNK from egypt and the leadership of the UNK clergy in colonial new england STOP
START much criticism has been UNK at this rather forced analogy , but what is equally significant is UNK complete acceptance of the UNK record as `` good and UNK history '' STOP
START in light of the UNK UNK UNK by the higher criticism this is a most remarkable statement , particularly coming from one who was well known for his UNK views STOP
START the desire to UNK a UNK at the expense of sound research technique UNK more of the UNK than the historian STOP
START a similar UNK characteristic is revealed in UNK failure to check the accuracy and UNK of his UNK sources STOP
START if he found data that UNK his general plan , he used it and counted his sources UNK STOP
START UNK , if statistics were UNK which UNK a UNK theory , the sources were UNK as UNK STOP
START such UNK are frequently encountered in his essay on the UNK of the UNK during the english UNK STOP
START adams UNK largely on the UNK of foreign UNK and observers in england , UNK that the reports of such agents had to be accurate because there were no newspapers STOP
START this is certainly an UNK UNK , in which the modern mind attempts to understand the spirit of the UNK century on UNK terms STOP
START moreover , he UNK the contemporary accounts of UNK , UNK UNK them to be UNK by UNK because `` the opinions of UNK are of no great value '' STOP
START what is UNK by this observation is not the inherent UNK of UNK but the UNK of UNK adams STOP
START in all UNK it must be admitted that adams made no UNK at being an UNK historian STOP
START UNK to him meant an UNK to UNK and to search for a synthesis STOP
START he UNK the impact of german UNK on the writing of history , UNK it a `` UNK UNK '' STOP
START UNK and his UNK had reduced history to a profession of UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK adams preferred the UNK of UNK or the style and UNK of edward UNK , for at least they took a stand on the issues about which they wrote STOP
START he wrote UNK to william james that UNK history was not only impossible but UNK STOP
START if the historian was convinced of his own UNK , then he should not allow his vision to become UNK by disturbing facts STOP
START it was history that must be in error , not the historian STOP
START it was this basic UNK that separated adams from the UNK of professional historians and led him to UNK time and time again what was his most serious UNK against the historical method -- namely , the tendency to assume the truth of an hypothesis before UNK it to the test of facts STOP
START all of UNK work reflects this UNK characteristic STOP
START no page seems to be complete without the statement of at least one UNK UNK STOP
START one example of this was his UNK that `` all UNK UNK must be dealt with by physical force '' STOP
START there is no explanation of terms nor a UNK that most such UNK have been dealt with by force -- only a UNK UNK that they must , because of some UNK UNK , be so UNK STOP
START on matters of race he was similarly UNK : `` most of the modern latin races seem to have UNK the UNK of the roman mind '' STOP
START he UNK the french revolution as UNK this UNK but makes no mention of the UNK , who have been able to UNK to all types of circumstances STOP
START he UNK that `` one of the first signs of UNK civilization is the fall in the value of women in UNK eyes '' STOP
START it made no difference that most evidence points to an opposite conclusion STOP
START for adams had made up his mind before all the facts were available STOP
START all critics of adams and his methods have observed this particular UNK STOP
START UNK was UNK by such UNK history as that which attributed the fall of the UNK empire to the UNK trade , and he urged adams to `` UNK his essay into a real history , UNK not merely those facts which fit into his theory , but also the UNK and exceptions '' STOP
START UNK called the adams method literally UNK , while UNK day maintained that the assumptions were not confined to theories alone but were also applicable to straight UNK evidence STOP
START moreover , stated day , `` he always UNK facts which tend to UNK his hypothesis '' STOP
START even UNK , who compared the emancipation of massachusetts to the UNK of a UNK from ancient UNK , was also forced to admit the UNK UNK of the author STOP
START in summary , UNK adams felt that the nature of history was order and that the order so discovered was as much subject to historical laws as the forces of nature STOP
START moreover , he believed that most professional historians lacked some of the essential instruments for a proper study of history STOP
START however , despite the insight of many of his observations , his own conclusions are open to suspicion because of his failure to UNK at all times the correct research methods STOP
START this should not UNK an evaluation of his findings , but they were not the findings of a completely UNK UNK STOP
START what was perhaps more important than his concept of the nature of history and the historical method were those forces which shaped the direction of his thought STOP
START in the final analysis his contribution to american UNK was founded on almost UNK insights into religion , economics , and UNK , the three factors which conditioned his search for a law of history STOP
START religion without UNK STOP
START UNK adams considered religion as an extremely significant UNK of man's fear of the unknown STOP
START but it was nothing more than that STOP
START religion and the churches were institutions which had been created by man , not god STOP
START he did not deny god ; ; STOP
START he simply did not believe that a creator UNK or UNK in human affairs STOP
START the historian need not be concerned with the philosophical problems suggested by religion STOP
START there was no evidence , either of a positive or negative type , of the actions of a divine being in this world ; ; STOP
START and , since the historian should only be interested in strictly UNK activity , his research should eliminate the supernatural STOP
START furthermore , he must regard religion as the expression of human forces STOP
START certainly , he must recognize its power and attempt to UNK its influence on the flow of history , but he must not UNK the natural and the UNK with the divine STOP
START adams was not breaking new ground when he claimed that the worship of an UNK power was in reality a reflection of man's inability to cope with his environment STOP
START students of UNK and comparative religion had long been aware that there was , indeed , a direct connection STOP
START but adams was one of the first to suggest that this human UNK was the only UNK factor behind religion STOP
START it was this fear which explained the development of a UNK UNK whose function in society was to UNK and UNK the angry UNK STOP
START to keep themselves UNK in power , the priests were forced to demonstrate their unique status through the UNK STOP
START it was the use of the supernatural that kept them in business STOP
START the german UNK of the fourth century offered an excellent example : STOP
START `` the germans in the fourth century were a very simple race , who UNK little of natural laws , and who therefore referred phenomena they did not understand to supernatural intervention STOP
START this intervention could only be controlled by priests , and thus the UNK caused a rapid rise in the influence of the sacred class STOP
START the power of every UNK organization has always UNK on the UNK , and the clergy have always proved their divine commission as did UNK '' STOP
START adams contended that once such a special class had been created it became a UNK interest and sought to maintain itself by assuming exclusive control over the relationships between god and man STOP
START thus , the church was born and because of its UNK character was soon identified as a conservative institution , determined to resist the forces of change , to identify itself with the political UNK , and to maintain a kind of UNK isolation from the masses STOP
START doctrine was not only mysterious ; ; STOP
START it was also sacred , `` and no UNK in an inspired church could UNK having her UNK examined as we should examine human laws '' STOP
START these basic ideas concerning the nature of religion were , adams believed , some of the major UNK to the understanding of history and the movement of society STOP
START the dark views about the UNK found in the emancipation of massachusetts were never altered STOP
START despite their UNK to the status UNK , the forces of organized religion were compelled to make adjustments as increasing civilization UNK human knowledge STOP
START in the law of civilization and decay UNK adams traced this evolution , always pointing to the fact that although the forms became more rational , the substance remained UNK STOP
START the UNK worship and UNK of the middle ages were more advanced forms than were primitive UNK worship and nature UNK STOP
START yet , the idea UNK in each was identical : to UNK the unknown with mystery and to UNK that class which had been given special UNK over the UNK of god STOP
START to adams that age in which religion exercised power over the entire culture of the race was one of imagination , and it is largely the UNK he so obviously held for such UNK that UNK a peculiar UNK -- a sentiment he would have probably denied STOP
START UNK had written his classic `` UNK of travel '' about these regions a hundred years before , and UNK , who had studied UNK in london and the great UNK of egypt and greece , had drawn the UNK illustrations that accompanied the text STOP
START UNK , an architect in new york , had been forgotten , like UNK , and victor UNK their lives as one UNK , for a museum , a UNK from two or three UNK bones STOP

START he had not yet undertaken the great UNK of his later years , the UNK of the ancient UNK highway , the route of UNK in UNK , but he had UNK to the original UNK UNK , the UNK lake of UNK , and he had UNK the southern UNK UNK with its UNK people and looked into the UNK mines of UNK STOP
START as a UNK living for two years at the UNK of the UNK , he had collected specimens for mexican UNK , and he had taken to the london UNK a live UNK , the sacred bird of the old UNK STOP
START in fact , he had raised UNK birds in his camp in the forest of UNK STOP
START moreover , he had spent six months on the UNK islands , among the great UNK that captain cook had found there , and now and then he would UNK into some small island of the west UNK STOP
START UNK book on john UNK UNK was largely written in my study in the house at UNK STOP
START i had had my name taken out of the telephone book , and this was partly because of a UNK who had been UNK from sing sing and who called me night after night STOP
START he said he was a friend of UNK UNK who had run a free employment bureau for several months during the depression , but the generous UNK to whom i wrote did not know his name and i somehow conceived the UNK notion that the man in question was UNK round the house STOP
START but one day came the voice of a man i had known when he was a boy , and i later remembered that this boy , thirty years before , had struck me as coming to no good STOP
START there had been something UNK about him that UNK me against him , -- i had never felt that way about any other boy , -- but when he UNK his name on the telephone i had forgotten this and i was UNK to do what he asked of me STOP

START i must have written to say how much i had enjoyed his fine book the building of eternal rome , and i found he had not UNK giving me the highest mark in his old course on the later latin poets , although in my final examination i had ignored the questions and filled the UNK with a comparison of UNK and UNK STOP

START there were several men of ninety or more whom i knew first or last , all of whom were still productive and most of whom knew one another as if they had naturally come together at the UNK of their lives STOP

START however , at UNK , he had still been busy writing articles , UNK and speaking , and i had never before known an englishman who had visited and UNK in three quarters of the united states STOP

START but i only thought of that in the middle of the night STOP
START many years later i went to see UNK england , where he was living at UNK , near UNK , and he showed me beside his UNK there the remains of the road on which UNK is supposed to have UNK STOP
START he was convinced that george UNK UNK was nearly all wrong as it applied to england , which was `` driving forward into UNK waters '' , with the danger of a new UNK ahead STOP
START `` but however we go , whatever our UNK , it will not take the UNK shape '' STOP
START with facts mainly in his mind , he was often UNK in the matter of style , and he said , `` the young who have as yet nothing to say will try UNK with initial letters and broken lines STOP
START but put them before a situation which they are forced to UNK '' , -- he was speaking of the spanish civil war , -- `` and they have no UNK ; ; STOP

START UNK UNK him to name one and he was UNK STOP
START but his UNK did not cease , and presently , on march 13 , when he UNK a UNK on the text , `` and UNK was UNK '' , he told his congregation how UNK he was in UNK , how he UNK having had him in his house , and how he should have been UNK by the fact that the novelist was UNK all the time that he was working on the book STOP

START UNK remarks about his marriage were UNK enough to UNK american reporters to UNK the offices of UNK , UNK & company for information , to pursue UNK to UNK hall , and , after she had returned to new york , to UNK her out at the UNK on upper fifth avenue where she had taken an apartment STOP
START there , to the evening post , she UNK denied the divorce UNK and explained that she had stayed behind because of the UNK of their son , which UNK would be strictly american STOP

START it was a dinner party , lewis had been drinking during the afternoon , and long before the party really got under way , he was quite UNK , with the result that the party broke up even before dinner was over STOP
START lewis , at the head of the table , would UNK up and move around behind the UNK of his guests making remarks that , when not highly UNK , were at least highly UNK , and then presently he UNK and was put to bed STOP

START blackman called the porter and had him remove everything but one bottle of UNK , and after that they would have a cocktail or two before dinner , or , on one of their walking trips , beer , or , in france and italy , wine in UNK STOP
START lewis gave him a UNK tour of london and , UNK and walking , took him to UNK , but the london stay was for only ten days , and on the twentieth they took the train for UNK , where they spent the night for an early morning channel UNK STOP
START near UNK , in a considerable establishment , lived UNK UNK , a well-known UNK writer , and his brother , UNK -- both friends of UNK STOP
START he suggested that they call on these brothers , who received them UNK STOP
START then they returned to their hotel and got ready for bed STOP
START it was late , and blackman was ready to go to sleep , but lewis was not STOP
START he said , `` we had a good time UNK , didn't we , UNK '' ? ? STOP
START UNK agreed , and lewis said that it would have been very different if his wife had been with him STOP
START then he kept blackman UNK for more than an hour while he did an imaginary UNK between his wife and himself in which , discussing the evening , he was continually UNK STOP
START he began the UNK by having his wife UNK that one does not UNK people's homes without warning them that one is coming , and went on from that with the entire UNK of his social UNK STOP
START from UNK on , if the lists exist , they contain between twenty to thirty names STOP
START as the total number of UNK UNK in UNK was , according to UNK ( life , UNK ) and n , two hundred UNK , the UNK names listed in the UNK UNK for that year constitute slightly less than one UNK of the total number of UNK who then UNK STOP
START there were four from UNK and four from christ's , three from UNK , and two from each of the colleges , jesus , UNK , UNK , and UNK , with UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK supplying one each in the UNK UNK STOP
START the list was headed by ( henry ) UNK of UNK who was UNK from UNK at UNK , UNK STOP
START he became a fellow of jesus in UNK , proceeded UNK jesus in UNK , and was UNK in UNK STOP
START the second name was ( edward ) UNK , UNK from UNK college at UNK , UNK STOP
START he proceeded UNK UNK , and UNK UNK , being made fellow in UNK STOP
START he was UNK UNK 16 june and priest 22 december UNK STOP
START the third name was ( john ) UNK , who was admitted to the inner temple in november UNK STOP
START the fourth name was ( john ) milton of christ's college , followed by ( richard ) UNK of UNK , who UNK 16 october UNK STOP
START UNK gave his UNK UNK , a mistake for UNK STOP
START UNK also proceeded UNK UNK and became a fellow of his college in that year STOP
START ( john ) UNK of christ's was UNK in the list , coming from UNK school under UNK as UNK 20 april UNK under UNK STOP
START the UNK name was ( richard ) UNK , written UNK , admitted to christ's college under UNK 2 july UNK STOP
START the UNK name was ( thomas ) UNK , admitted to christ's 4 march UNK under UNK STOP
START christ's college was well represented that year in the UNK , and the name highest on the list from that college was UNK , fourth in the entire university STOP
START small wonder that milton later UNK of how well his work had been received there , since he UNK a rank in the order of UNK UNK higher than that of any other UNK from christ's of that year STOP
START it is not possible to UNK fully the arrangements whereby these UNK lists were then made up or even how the names that they contained assumed the order in which we find them STOP
START the process usually began with a UNK UNK about a boy , as UNK had UNK about UNK , to the higher officers of the college and university STOP
START then the various officers of the college might take up the case STOP
START it would , however , reach the UNK and other officers in charge of the UNK performances of the UNK UNK , and the place that any individual obtained in the lists UNK greatly on how he UNK himself in the public schools during his acts UNK as he was UNK STOP
START of course the higher officials could add or place a name on the list wherever they wished STOP
START UNK name being fourth is neither too high nor too low to be assigned to the arbitrary action of UNK , UNK , master , or other mighty hand STOP
START he evidently UNK the place assigned him STOP
START UNK of UNK UNK career STOP
START looking back from the spring of UNK over the four years of UNK UNK days , certain phases of his college career stand out as of permanent consequence to him and hence to us STOP
START of course the principal factor in the whole experience was the kind of education he received STOP
START it UNK from what an UNK receives today from any american college or university mainly in the certainty of what he was forced to learn compared with the loose and widely scattered information obtained today by most of our UNK STOP
START milton was required to UNK and display an intensive and accurate knowledge of latin UNK , UNK , ethics , physics or natural philosophy , metaphysics , and latin , greek , and UNK STOP
START he had also UNK various special fields of learning , being unable to miss some study of UNK , UNK ( law ) , and UNK ( medicine ) STOP
START above all , he had learned to write formal latin prose and verse to a remarkable degree of UNK STOP
START he had learned to dispute UNK , both UNK and UNK in latin , and according to the rules on any UNK , UNK or UNK , drawn from almost any subject , more especially from UNK works STOP
START he could produce carefully constructed UNK , set and formal speeches , UNK and UNK made by writing and UNK with all the aid his UNK and others could provide , and then delivered UNK from memory STOP
START he had also learned to dispute UNK remarkably well , the main evidence for which of course is the presence of his name in the UNK list of UNK STOP
START he also displayed the ability to write latin verse on almost any UNK of dispute , the UNK , of course , to be delivered from memory STOP
START then we have UNK at least one instance of a poem prepared for another , in UNK UNK UNK UNK , and perhaps also the de idea UNK STOP
START but his greatest achievement , in his own eyes and in the eyes of his colleagues and teachers , was his amazing ability to produce literary latin pieces , and he was often called on to do so STOP
START these were his public academic activities , UNK UNK , in the college and in the university STOP
START and his performances attracted much attention , as the frequency of his UNK pieces in any calendar that may be set up for his UNK activities UNK STOP
START his other activities are not so easily UNK STOP
START his statements about sports and exercises of a physical nature are UNK , but UNK STOP
START his later UNK of his skill with the small UNK are UNK of much time and practice devoted to the use of that weapon STOP
START UNK and others have dealt with sports and UNK at cambridge in UNK day with not very specific results STOP
START milton himself , UNK as he is about his lesser and UNK activities , at least gives us some evidence that he was a great UNK , under any and all conditions STOP
START his early poems and some of his prose UNK speak of UNK in the city and the neighboring country that may be extended to cambridge and its surrounding UNK STOP
START the town itself and the `` UNK UNK '' he often visited , as did all in the university STOP
START the churches , the UNK , and the various other places of the town must have known his figure well as he UNK to and about them STOP
START the tiny UNK of UNK to the north , with the UNK and UNK lying on down the UNK river , may have attracted him often , as it did many other UNK of the time STOP
START the UNK UNK hills to the UNK UNK him and all other students a UNK point from which to view the town and university of their dwelling STOP
START the country about cambridge is flat and not particularly spectacular in its UNK , though it offers easy going to the foot UNK STOP
START ball games , especially UNK , required some attention , and other organized sports may have attracted him as UNK or UNK STOP
START he UNK , as did everybody , and UNK the various UNK UNK of that day , although his UNK while at cambridge and after that he was no UNK point to reasonable UNK from the wild drinking UNK of some of the UNK and , we must add , of some of their UNK including many of the UNK or teachers STOP
START what manner of person does milton appear to have been when as an UNK he UNK at christ's college ? ? STOP
START he was then a slightly built young man of UNK appearance , medium UNK , and UNK face STOP
START UNK as his UNK and UNK UNK had taught him to be in addition to the natural grace of his slight , UNK frame , he cut enough of a figure to have UNK a UNK in the college , to which he himself referred in UNK 6 : : STOP
START a UNK , , UNK UNK UNK STOP
START that is , if we can trust that most UNK of UNK , UNK as it is with UNK and UNK STOP
START the UNK sounds real enough , if we could only trust the conditions under which we learn of its use ; ; STOP
START but anyone who would put much trust in any phase of UNK 6 , except its UNK UNK UNK whatever fate may be UNK out to him by virtue of the UNK UNK UNK STOP
START in short , the traditional UNK for milton of ' lady of christ's ' , while UNK fitting , rests only on this UNK passage in the UNK of the most UNK piece of writing milton left us STOP
START UNK mention of it ( UNK , and UNK UNK UNK , UNK ) comes from this UNK , through UNK milton or edward UNK STOP
START it is not a question of truth or UNK ; ; STOP
START the UNK in which the UNK statement about the UNK occurs is such a mass of UNK UNK UNK that almost nothing in it can be accepted as true -- or UNK as false STOP
START the entire exercise , latin and english , is most UNK of the kind of person milton had become at christ's during his UNK career ; ; STOP
START the mere fact that he was selected , though as a substitute , to act as UNK or UNK for it , or perhaps we should say with UNK as ' father of the act ' , is in itself a difficult phase of his development to UNK STOP
START milton was to act as the UNK , the supreme UNK , the lightly UNK UNK , UNK UNK , who could at once trip lightly over that which UNK such treatment , or could at will UNK the common enemies of the college gathering , and with words alone STOP
START from an exercise involving merely UNK , UNK UNK , in his hands the performance turned into a UNK of UNK and word play , UNK at times , but always learned , pointed , and carefully aimed at some individuals present , and at the whole assembly STOP
START to do this successfully required great skill and a special talent for both UNK and UNK UNK , a talent not UNK on many persons , but one with which milton was marked as being UNK and in which , at least in this performance , he obviously UNK STOP
START it may be thought unfortunate that he was called on entirely by accident to perform , if again we may trust the opening of the UNK , for it marks the beginning for us of his use of his peculiar form of UNK word play that even in this latin UNK has in it the UNK element of UNK and an almost UNK delight in UNK UNK an UNK STOP
START but the real UNK of this development in him go back to the opposing of UNK school , and probably if it had not been this occasion and these latin lines it would have been some others , such as the first UNK , that set off this UNK in him of UNK and UNK verbal attack on an enemy STOP
START all western europe would hear and listen to him in this same vein about the middle of the century STOP
START but these UNK that we have UNK from the christ's college days are only one phase of his existence then STOP
START perhaps his most important private activity was the combination of reading , discussion with a few -- if we can trust his writings to UNK and the younger UNK , very few -- UNK UNK STOP
START lines UNK of UNK later point to a friendship with edward king , who entered christ's college 9 june UNK STOP
START no other names among the young men in residence at the time seem to have been even suggested by milton as those of persons with whom he in any way UNK STOP
START but that scarcely means that he was the UNK , UNK type of student who shared few if any activities with his fellows , the UNK of the UNK UNK providing enough evidence to deny this STOP
START apparently he was not a UNK in the college or university UNK , which he once attacked as utterly UNK performances ( see UNK , UNK ) ; ; STOP
START but even in that famous passage , milton was UNK not at the UNK as such but at their performance by ' persons either UNK , or presently to enter into the ministry STOP
START the fact that he nowhere mentioned UNK performances as part of the activities of the boys later in his UNK academy ( UNK ) should not be taken too seriously as evidence that he desired them to UNK such performances STOP
START perhaps , in that short piece or letter written to UNK in which he UNK his scheme for UNK young men , he merely UNK that phase of their exercises STOP
START writers of this class of science fiction have clearly in mind the assumptions that man can master the principles of this UNK universe and that such UNK will necessarily better the human lot STOP
START on the other hand , the bright vision of the future has been directly stated in science fiction concerned with UNK ideal societies -- science fiction , of course , is related , if sometimes UNK , to that utopian literature optimistic about science , literature whose period of greatest UNK in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries produced edward UNK looking backward and UNK a modern utopia STOP
START in arthur UNK UNK end ( 1953 ) , though written after the present flood of UNK began , we can see the bright vision of science fiction clearly defined STOP
START UNK end -- apparently UNK to UNK UNK utopian UNK , UNK UNK UNK ( UNK ) , and also to UNK UNK of the future , especially , the world set free ( UNK ) and the shape of things to come ( UNK ) -- describes the UNK UNK of earth by the UNK , UNK superior creatures who come to our world in order to prepare the human race for its next stage of development , an UNK UNK with the UNK mind of the universe STOP
START arriving just in time to stop men from turning their UNK into a UNK UNK , the UNK UNK earth into one world in which justice , order , and UNK UNK and ignorance , UNK , and fear have UNK to exist STOP
START under their rule , earth becomes a technological utopia STOP
START both UNK of war and new techniques of production , particularly UNK factories , greatly increase the world's wealth , a situation described in the following passage , which has the true utopian ring : `` everything was so UNK that the necessities of life were free , provided as a public service by the community , as roads , water , street lighting and UNK had once been STOP
START a man could travel anywhere he pleased , eat whatever he UNK -- without UNK over any money '' STOP
START with destructive tensions and pressures removed men have the UNK and energy to construct a new human life -- UNK entire cities , expanding facilities for entertainment , providing unlimited opportunities for education -- indeed , for the first time giving everyone the chance to UNK his talents to the UNK STOP
START mankind , as a result , UNK previously UNK of levels of civilization and culture , a golden age which the UNK , a very evident symbol of science , have helped produce by UNK reason and the scientific method into human activities STOP
START thus science is the UNK of mankind , and in this respect UNK end only UNK in greater detail the vision of the future which , though not always so directly stated , has nevertheless been present in the minds of most UNK writers STOP
START considering then the UNK which has UNK science fiction for so long , what is really remarkable is that during the last twelve years many UNK writers have turned about and attacked their own UNK vision of the future , have attacked the UNK end kind of faith that science and technology will inevitably better the human condition STOP
START and they have done this on a very large scale , with a UNK flood of novels and stories which are either UNK or UNK of UNK with UNK elements STOP
START because of the means of publication -- UNK magazines and UNK UNK -- and because UNK science fiction is still UNK in quantity the full range and extent of this phenomenon can hardly be known , though one fact is evident : the UNK imagination has been UNK UNK in its UNK STOP
START among the UNK , for example , UNK UNK the UNK of steel ( 1954 ) UNK the deadly effects on human life of the UNK of the future ; ; STOP
START james UNK a case of conscience ( 1958 ) describes a world UNK from its own weapons of destruction in underground shelters ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK UNK UNK ( 1954 ) presents a UNK society in which wall television and UNK UNK UNK UNK minds ; ; STOP
START walter UNK , UNK , a UNK for UNK ( 1959 ) finds men , after the great atomic disaster , UNK back to their previous level of civilization and another UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK `` the UNK touch '' ( 1954 ) UNK an economy of UNK which , in order to remain UNK , must set its UNK to UNK surplus production ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK `` UNK '' ( 1954 ) tells of a future when UNK have taken over , leaving men nothing to do ; ; STOP
START and robert UNK the status civilization ( 1960 ) describes a world which , UNK by the powers of destruction science has given it , becomes UNK and UNK STOP
START a more complete list would also include UNK `` the UNK '' ( 1951 ) , UNK UNK solar UNK ( 1955 ) , david UNK one ( 1953 ) , wilson UNK the long UNK silence ( 1952 ) , UNK UNK to live forever ( 1956 ) , UNK UNK UNK ( 1954 ) , and UNK UNK UNK ( 1952 ) , as well as the three perhaps most outstanding UNK , UNK UNK and UNK the space merchants ( 1953 ) , UNK UNK UNK piano ( 1952 ) , and john UNK UNK ( 1953 ) , works which we will later examine in detail STOP
START the novels and stories like UNK UNK walk ( 1960 ) , with the focus on UNK and with the UNK elements only a UNK background -- in this case an uneasy , UNK world in which the mass of people do UNK routine jobs while a carefully selected , UNK UNK runs everything -- are in all UNK as numerous as UNK STOP
START there is , of course , nothing new about UNK , for they belong to a literary tradition which , including also the closely related UNK UNK , UNK from at least as far back as the eighteenth century and UNK UNK UNK to the twentieth century and UNK we , UNK war with the UNK , UNK brave new world , UNK `` the machine UNK '' , UNK that UNK strength , and UNK nineteen UNK , and which in science fiction is represented before the present UNK as early as UNK UNK , the time machine , `` a story of the days to come '' , and when the UNK UNK , and as recently as UNK UNK `` with UNK hands '' ( 1947 ) , the classic story of men replaced by their own UNK STOP
START what makes the current phenomenon unique is that so many UNK writers have UNK a trend and turned to writing works critical of the impact of science and technology on human life STOP
START since the great flood of these UNK has appeared only in the last twelve years , it seems fairly reasonable to assume that the chief UNK was the 1949 publication of nineteen UNK , an assumption which is supported by the frequent UNK of such details as room UNK , along with education by conditioning from brave new world , a book to which UNK writers may well have returned with new interest after reading the more powerful UNK UNK STOP
START not all recent science fiction , however , is UNK , for the optimistic strain is still very much alive in mission of UNK and UNK end , as we have seen , as well as in many other recent popular novels and stories like fred UNK the black cloud ( 1957 ) ; ; STOP
START and among works of UNK science fiction , not all provide UNK criticism and very few have much merit as literature -- but then real quality has always been UNK in science fiction STOP
START in addition , there are many areas of the human situation besides the impact of science and technology which are examined , for UNK UNK often UNK political , social , economic UNK only indirectly related to science and technology STOP
START nevertheless , with all these UNK and exceptions , the current UNK phenomenon remains impressive for its criticism that science and technology , instead of bringing utopia , may well UNK , UNK , and even destroy men STOP
START how effectively these UNK can be presented is seen in UNK and UNK the space merchants , UNK UNK piano and UNK UNK STOP
START easily the best known of these three novels is the space merchants , a good example of a UNK UNK which UNK much more than the impact of science on human life , though its most important warning is in this area , namely as to the use to which UNK in the UNK sciences may be put STOP
START the novel , which is not merely UNK but also UNK UNK , describes a future america where UNK of the population , the men who run advertising agencies and big corporations , control the rest of the people , the UNK UNK who are the workers and UNK , with the government being no more than `` a UNK house for pressures '' STOP
START like ours , the economy of the space merchants must constantly UNK in order to survive , and , like ours , it is based on the principle of `` ever increasing UNK work and profits in the circle of consumption '' STOP
START the consequences , of course , have been UNK : UNK expansion has led to UNK , UNK of the earth and UNK of its natural resources STOP
START for example , even the most successful executive lives in a UNK apartment while ordinary people rent space in the UNK of office buildings in which to sleep at night ; ; STOP
START UNK have replaced meat , and wood has become so precious that it is saved for expensive UNK ; ; STOP
START and the atmosphere is so UNK that no one UNK walk in the open without UNK or UNK UNK STOP
START while the space merchants indicates , as UNK UNK has correctly observed , some of the `` UNK consequences of the growth of industrial and commercial power '' and UNK `` existing habits in the advertising profession '' , its warning and analysis UNK much deeper STOP
START what is wrong with advertising is not only that it is an `` UNK , an assault on people's mental UNK '' or that it is a major cause for a UNK economy of UNK or that it contains a UNK tendency ( which is closer to the point ) STOP
START rather what UNK and UNK are really doing is warning against the UNK inherent in UNK `` a science of man and his motives '' STOP
START the space merchants , like such UNK documents as joseph wood UNK the measure of man and UNK the UNK of man , considers what may result from the scientific study of human nature STOP
START if man is actually the product of his environment and if science can discover the laws of human nature and the ways in which environment determines what people do , then someone -- a someone probably standing outside traditional systems of values -- can turn around and develop completely efficient means for controlling people STOP
START thus we will have a society consisting of the UNK or UNK , and the controlled STOP
START and this , of course , is exactly what madison avenue has been accused of doing UNK in a primitive way , with its `` UNK UNK '' and what the space merchants accomplish with much greater UNK and precision STOP
START UNK and UNK UNK men have long since thrown out UNK to reason and developed techniques of advertising which tie in with `` every basic UNK and UNK in american life '' , which work on the UNK of UNK , which are linked to the `` great prime UNK of the human spirit '' STOP
START as the hero , UNK UNK , explains before his conversion , the job of advertising is `` to UNK people without letting them know that they're being convinced '' STOP
START and to do this requires first of all the kind of information about people which is provided by the scientists in industrial UNK and consumer research , who , for example , tell UNK that three days is the `` optimum UNK period for a closed social circuit to be UNK with a UNK UNK '' -- which means that an effective propaganda technique is to send an idea into UNK and then three days later UNK or UNK it STOP
START and the second requirement for UNK people without their knowledge is artistic talent to prepare the words and pictures which UNK by using the principles which the scientists have discovered STOP
START thus the UNK in the world of the space merchants is the person who in earlier ages might have been a UNK poet , the person `` capable of putting together words that UNK and move and sing '' STOP
START as UNK explains , `` here in this profession we reach into the souls of men and women STOP
START and we do it by taking talent -- and UNK it '' STOP
START now the basic question to be asked in this situation is what UNK the UNK , that is , what are their values ? ? STOP
START -- since , as UNK says , `` nobody should play with lives the way we do unless he's UNK by the highest ideals '' STOP
START but the only ideal he can think of is `` sales '' ! ! STOP
START indeed , again and again , the space merchants confirm the UNK of the UNK that the UNK and UNK scientists , once they have seen through human nature , will have nothing except their UNK and desires to guide them STOP
START we often say of a person that he `` looks young for his age '' or `` old for his age '' STOP
START yet even in the more extreme of such cases we seldom go very far UNK in UNK what his age actually is STOP
START and this means , i suppose , that almost invariably age reveals itself by easily UNK signs UNK on both the body and the mind STOP
START `` young for his age '' means only the presence of some minor characteristic not quite usual STOP
START UNK quite sufficient for UNK are nevertheless there STOP
START an assumption of youth , or the presence of a few UNK characteristics , UNK no more successfully than UNK or UNK hair STOP
START `` looking young for your age '' means `` for your age '' and it means no more STOP
START a mind expressing itself in words may reveal itself a little less obviously as old or young STOP
START its surface UNK its UNK and UNK to its UNK in ways less immediately obvious than the body does STOP
START youth may be , and often is , UNK , UNK or UNK ; ; STOP
START age may be UNK , UNK and much given to UNK of UNK STOP
START but there is , nevertheless , always a subtle difference in the way in which UNK similar opinions are held STOP
START the UNK of the young is UNK , anxious to UNK or even UNK its UNK UNK , and so UNK as to reveal the fact that it UNK its ability to face up to the UNK truth as more than enough to UNK for the UNK of that truth STOP
START similarly the UNK of age UNK too much STOP
START if it UNK that the best is yet to be , it always UNK , at least in the young , either a UNK question or perhaps the UNK of the negro youth who saw on a UNK the UNK , `` i am not dead but sleeping '' STOP
START `` boy , you UNK UNK nobody but yourself '' STOP
START we may say of some UNK that they were never young STOP
START we cannot UNK say of anyone who has succeeded in entering deep into his sixties that he was never old STOP
START those famous lines of the greek UNK with which a UNK beauty UNK her mirror at the UNK of a UNK reveal a wise attitude : `` UNK , take my UNK glass , since i am not what i was , what from this day i shall be , UNK , let me never see '' STOP
START no good can come of UNK the sad , inevitable fact that once youth has passed `` a worse and worse time still UNK the former '' STOP
START but there are at least two reasons for UNK one's mind in even a UNK mirror STOP
START one is that there sometimes are real although inadequate UNK in growing old STOP
START UNK , if one is fortunate enough to achieve it , is not so good as joy , but it is something STOP
START even to be `` from hope and fear set free '' is at least better than to have lost the first without having got UNK of the second STOP
START the other reason ( and the one with which i am here concerned ) is that one thus becomes inclined to UNK of any opinion , or change of opinion , whether it represents the wisdom of experience or is only the result of the difference between youth and age which is as inevitable as the all too obvious physical differences STOP
START one may be UNK aware that if the answer is favorable it will be judged such only by those of one's own age STOP
START but at least the question has been raised STOP
START many readers of this department no doubt discount certain of my opinions for the simple reason that they can UNK pretty accurately , even if they have never actually been told , what my age is STOP
START at least i should like them to know that i know these UNK are being made STOP
START let me then ( and in public ) glance into the mirror STOP
START i have known some men and women who said that the UNK they are told about or even remember seem UNK UNK to them now ; ; STOP
START that their remote past is as UNK with their present UNK , as lacking in any conscious UNK to their mature personality , as the self of a UNK may be UNK UNK with that of the UNK it once was STOP
START for my part i find it difficult to conceive such a state of affairs STOP
START i have changed and i have UNK opinions ; ; STOP
START but i am so aware of an UNK continuity of the UNK or UNK that i see only as absurd the tendency of some psychologists from UNK to UNK and UNK to regard consciousness as no more than a flux amid which nothing remains UNK STOP
START so far as i am concerned , the child is UNK father to the man , despite the obvious fact that child and father differ greatly -- sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse STOP
START fundamental values , UNK and the way in which one approaches a conviction change less , of course , than specific opinions STOP
START that fact is very clearly illustrated in the case of the many present-day UNK who were communists or UNK in their youth and are now so extremely conservative ( or reactionary , as many would say ) that they can define no important political conviction that does not seem so far from even a UNK position as to make the distinction between UNK and UNK for them hardly worth noting STOP
START but in ways more fundamental than specific political opinions they are still what they always were : UNK , sure without a UNK of doubt of whatever it is that they are sure of , capable of seeing black and white only and , therefore , committed to the logical extreme of whatever it is they are temporarily committed to STOP
START to those of my readers who find many of my opinions UNK , or UNK , or UNK UNK ( and i have reason to know that there are some such ) , i would like to say what i have already UNK , namely , that some of my opinions may indeed be subject to some discount on the simple ground that i am no longer young and therefore UNK of being UNK of mind STOP
START but i will also UNK them that i have always been inclined to UNK , to a kind of UNK lack of UNK so far as public affairs are concerned ; ; STOP
START so that , although not as eager as i once was to be UNK of , i can still resist prevailing opinions STOP
START at about the age of twelve i became a UNK liberal , and i have always considered myself a liberal of some kind even though the definition has changed repeatedly since UNK became a reactionary STOP
START several times in my youth i voted the socialist UNK , but less because i was socialist than because i was not either a republican or a UNK , and i voted for franklin roosevelt every time he was a UNK STOP
START yet during the years when i was on the staff of the nation , i tried to the limit the patience of the editors on almost every occasion when i was permitted to write an editorial having a bearing on a political or social question STOP
START never once during the trying UNK did i come so close to UNK to the private climate of opinion as to grant russian communism even that most UNK of UNK `` an interesting experiment '' STOP
START there are few things of which i am UNK than of that UNK record STOP
START many of my friends at the time thought that i had received a UNK UNK when lincoln UNK UNK me in a review of one of my books as a perfect example of the UNK man who could understand and UNK only with the dead past STOP
START but he , as i can now UNK , was the man who could see so short a distance ahead that after a visit to russia he gave voice to the famous UNK : `` i have seen the future and it works '' STOP
START the favorite UNK of those who have now UNK their approval of communism is that they did not know how things would develop STOP
START with this UNK i have never been much impressed STOP
START there was , it seems to me , enough in the openly declared principles and UNK of russian leaders to UNK UNK men without their having to wait to see how it would turn out STOP
START once many years ago i sat at dinner next to arthur train , and the subject of the nation came up STOP
START he asked me suddenly , `` what are your political opinions '' ? ? STOP
START `` well '' , i replied , `` some of my colleagues on the paper regard me as a rank reactionary '' STOP
START after a UNK thought he replied , `` that still leaves you a lot of UNK '' STOP
START and i suppose it did STOP
START i never have been , and am not now , any kind of utopian STOP
START when i first came across samuel UNK UNK , `` the remedy for the UNK of life is UNK rather than radical '' , it seemed to me to sum up the UNK of political and social UNK STOP
START it will probably explain more of my attitudes toward society than any other phrase or principle could STOP
START why did i choose to fill these pages in this particular issue with this mixture of rather UNK UNK and UNK ? ? STOP
START the reason is , i think , my awareness that my remarks last quarter on UNK may well have served to confirm the opinion of some that my tendency to UNK and UNK gets us nowhere , and that i am simply too old to hope STOP
START i would , however , like to suggest that , wrong though i may be , the tendency to see UNK rather than solutions is one of which i have been a victim ever since i can remember , and therefore not merely a UNK phenomenon STOP
START i know that one must act STOP
START but one need not always be sure that the action is either wise or UNK STOP
START UNK of what some would call UNK , i remember an UNK the source of which i forget STOP
START it concerns a UNK minister who UNK an impressive object lesson by UNK a lion and a UNK together in the same UNK outside his church door STOP
START not only his UNK , but the whole town and , ultimately , the whole county were UNK impressed by this object lesson STOP
START one day he was visited by a UNK of UNK UNK who wanted to know his secret STOP
START `` how on earth do you manage it ? ? STOP
START what is the UNK '' ? ? STOP
START `` why '' , he replied , `` it is perfectly simple ; ; STOP
START there is no UNK involved STOP
START all you have to do is put in a fresh UNK from time to time '' STOP
START UNK ? ? STOP
START UNK ? ? STOP
START not really , it seems to me STOP
START the promise that the lion and the UNK will lie down together was given in the future UNK STOP
START it is not something that can be expected to happen now STOP
START without really changing the general subject , i take this opportunity to UNK that i am troubled by UNK , not only about UNK , but also when asked to join in the protest against a law that most of those who consider themselves UNK and liberal seem to regard as obviously UNK ; ; STOP
START namely , the law that UNK the death UNK for murder when there seem to be no UNK circumstances STOP
START it is not that i am UNK of the force of their strongest UNK STOP
START life , they say , should be regarded as sacred and , therefore , as something that neither an individual nor his society has a right to take away STOP
START in fact i cannot imagine myself UNK a man to the UNK or the electric chair if i had to take , as an individual , the responsibility for his death STOP
START just as i know i would make a bad soldier even though i cannot UNK call myself a UNK , so too i would not be either a UNK by profession or , if i could avoid it , even a member of a UNK jury STOP
START despite these facts the question `` : : STOP
START should no UNK ever be UNK '' ? ? STOP
START seems to me to create a dilemma not to be UNK disposed of by a simple negative answer STOP
START punishment of the UNK , so liberals are inclined to say , can have only three possible UNK : UNK , UNK or UNK example STOP
START for here if anywhere in contemporary literature is a major effort to UNK UNK and UNK some of its former UNK to the UNK image of the species man , or , as malraux himself puts it , `` to make men conscious of the UNK they ignore in themselves '' STOP
START 1 , STOP
START UNK UNK the UNK trees of UNK was written in the early years of the second world war , during a period of enforced UNK when he was taken UNK by the germans after the fall of france STOP
START the UNK , presumably after being UNK out of the country , was published in UNK in 1943 STOP
START the work as it stands is not the entire book that malraux wrote at that time -- it is only the first section of a UNK novel called la UNK UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START and this first section was somehow preserved ( there are always these UNK little UNK about the actual facts of UNK life ) when the UNK destroyed the rest STOP
START if we are to believe the list of UNK printed in UNK latest book , la UNK UNK UNK , UNK ( ( 1957 ) , he is still engaged in writing a large novel under his original title STOP
START but as he remarks in his UNK to the UNK trees , `` a novel can hardly ever be UNK '' , and `` when this one appears in its final form , the form of the first part will no doubt be UNK changed '' STOP
START malraux UNK , perhaps with a UNK too UNK a UNK , that his UNK work will accordingly `` appeal only to the UNK of UNK '' and `` to UNK of what might have been '' STOP
START even in its present form , however , the first part of UNK UNK novel is among the greatest works of UNK century literature ; ; STOP
START and it should be far better known than it is STOP
START the theme of the UNK trees of UNK is most closely related to its immediate UNK in UNK UNK of novels : man's hope ( UNK ) STOP
START this magnificent but greatly UNK book , which bodies forth the very form and pressure of its time as no other comparable creation , has suffered severely from having been written about an historical event -- the spanish civil war -- that is still capable of UNK the UNK UNK of old political UNK STOP
START even so apparently UNK a critic as UNK has taken for granted that the book was originally intended as a piece of UNK propaganda ; ; STOP
START and has then gone on to argue , with UNK consistency , that all the obviously UNK aspects of the book are simply UNK `` UNK '' STOP
START nothing , however , could be farther from the truth STOP
START the whole purpose of man's hope is to UNK the tragic UNK between means and ends inherent in all organized political violence -- and even when such violence is a necessary and legitimate UNK of liberty , justice and human dignity STOP
START nowhere before in UNK pages have we met such UNK UNK of a `` quality of man '' which UNK the realm of politics and even the realm of action altogether -- both the action of UNK early UNK like UNK and UNK , and the UNK action of dedicated communists like UNK UNK and UNK in man's fate STOP
START `` man UNK only a small part of himself in an action '' says old UNK the UNK ; ; STOP
START `` and the more the action claims to be total , the smaller is the part of man engaged '' STOP
START these lines never cease to UNK the book UNK all the UNK of combat , and to make an appeal for a larger and more UNK human community than one based on the UNK necessities of war STOP
START it is this larger theme of the `` quality of man '' , a quality that UNK the ideological and UNK into `` the human '' , which now forms the UNK heart of UNK artistic universe STOP
START malraux , to be sure , does not abandon the world of violence , combat and sudden death which has become his UNK as a creative artist , and which is the only world , apparently , in which his imagination can UNK into life STOP
START the UNK trees of UNK includes not one war but two , and UNK in a UNK revolution along with some UNK fighting in the desert for good measure STOP
START but while war still serves as a UNK for the values that malraux wishes to express , these values are no longer linked with the UNK or defeat of any cause -- whether that of an individual UNK of the UNK , or a collective attempt to escape from the UNK of UNK -- as their necessary condition STOP
START on the contrary , the UNK and UNK of combat is only the UNK foil against which the sudden UNK of the human UNK forth with the UNK UNK of a UNK STOP
START 2 , STOP
START the UNK trees of UNK is composed in the form of a UNK , with the two small side panels UNK and UNK the main central UNK of the novel STOP
START this central UNK consists of a series of UNK scenes set in the period from the beginning of the present century up to the first world war STOP
START the UNK scenes , on the other hand , both take place in the late spring of 1940 , just at the moment of the defeat of france in the second great world conflict STOP
START the UNK is an UNK serving with the french army , and he has the same name ( UNK ) that malraux himself was later to use in the resistance ; ; STOP
START like malraux he was also serving in the UNK corps before being captured , and we learn as well that in civilian life he had been a writer STOP
START these UNK UNK are obvious , and far too much time has been spent UNK on their possible implications STOP
START much more important is to UNK the feelings of the UNK ( whose full name is never given ) as he becomes aware of the UNK and UNK mass of french UNK UNK together in a temporary prison camp in and around the UNK of UNK STOP
START for as his UNK gradually UNK back into a state of primitive UNK with UNK necessity , as they lose all the UNK of their acquired culture , he is overcome by the feeling that he is at last being confronted with the essence of mankind STOP
START `` as a writer , by what have i been UNK these last ten years , if not by mankind ? ? STOP
START here i am face to face with the UNK UNK '' STOP
START the intuition about mankind UNK in these opening pages is of crucial importance for understanding the remainder of the text ; ; STOP
START and we must attend to it more closely than has usually been done STOP
START what does the UNK see and what does he feel ? ? STOP
START a good many pages of the first section are taken up with an account of the UNK determination of the UNK to write to their wives and families -- even when it becomes clear that the germans are simply allowing the letters to UNK away in the wind STOP
START UNK and UNK , in UNK , UNK phrases , the soldiers continue to bridge the distance between themselves and those they love ; ; STOP

START while it is UNK to project the trend of history , it seems clear that a genuine community is UNK emerging in the western world , particularly among the countries of western europe STOP
START at the end of world war 2 , , free europe was ready for a new beginning STOP
START the UNK of nationalism had brought down upon europe a generation of UNK and war , and a return to the old order of things seemed UNK STOP
START under these conditions a new generation of UNK began to discover the bonds of long association and shared values that for so long had been UNK to UNK UNK STOP
START a slow and painful trend toward UNK has taken hold , a trend which may at any time be UNK and UNK but which may also lead to a binding UNK of europe STOP
START it may well be that the UNK of europe will prove inadequate , that the survival of free society will require nothing less than the UNK of the entire western world STOP
START the movement toward european unity has been expressed in two UNK : UNK and UNK , one looking to the constitution of a united states of europe , the other building on UNK UNK of practical cooperation for the solution of specific problems STOP
START thus far the advances made have been almost entirely along functional lines STOP
START many factors contributed to the growth of the european movement STOP
START in 1946 sir UNK UNK , who had spoken often of european union during the war , UNK the formation of `` a kind of united states of europe '' STOP
START had UNK been returned to office in 1945 , it is just possible that britain , instead of standing UNK UNK , would have led europe toward union STOP
START in 1947 and 1948 the necessity of massive coordinated efforts to achieve economic recovery led to the formation of the organization for european economic cooperation to UNK and UNK the uses of american aid under the marshall plan STOP
START the united states might well have UNK the opportunity provided by the european recovery program to push the UNK european nations toward political UNK as well as economic cooperation , but all proposals to this effect were rejected by the united states government at the time STOP
START another powerful factor in the european movement was the threat of soviet UNK STOP
START the communist UNK in UNK in 1948 was followed immediately by the conclusion of the UNK UNK , a UNK alliance among britain , france and the UNK countries STOP
START and of course the soviet threat was responsible for nato , the grand alliance of the atlantic nations STOP
START new UNK of UNK UNK in the decade following the conclusion of the nato alliance STOP
START in 1949 the council of europe came into existence , a purely UNK UNK body but the first UNK of political rather than functional unity STOP
START in 1952 , the european UNK and steel community was launched , placing the UNK and steel production of france , west germany , italy and UNK under a UNK high authority STOP
START for a time it appeared that a common european army might be created , but the project for a european defense community was rejected by the french national assembly in 1954 STOP
START in 1957 the UNK approach to european integration was UNK by the formation among `` the six '' of a UNK european common market , and UNK for cooperation in the development of atomic energy STOP
START the `` overseas '' UNK have generally encouraged the european UNK movement without seriously considering the wisdom of their own full participation in a broader atlantic community STOP
START the united states and canada belong only to nato and the new UNK STOP
START britain until recently went along in some areas with all of the enthusiasm of the UNK at a UNK UNK STOP
START in other areas it held back , UNK its UNK bonds STOP
START now britain has decided to seek admission to the european economic community and it seems certain that she will be joined by some of her UNK in the loose free trade area of the `` outer seven '' STOP
START besides its historical significance as a break with the UNK tradition of british UNK , UNK move , if successful , will constitute an historic UNK of the first importance in the movement toward the UNK of europe and the western world STOP
START if a broader atlantic community is to be formed -- and my own judgment is that it lies within the realm of both our needs and our capacity -- a ready UNK of machinery is at hand in the nato alliance STOP
START the time is now UNK , indeed UNK , for the vigorous development of its UNK UNK , for its development as an instrument of atlantic community STOP
START what is required is the full UNK of article 2 of the UNK , which provides : `` the parties will contribute toward the further development of peaceful and friendly international relations by UNK their free institutions , by bringing about a better understanding of the principles upon which these institutions are founded , and by promoting conditions of stability and UNK STOP
START they will seek to eliminate conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage economic UNK between any and all of them '' STOP
START as UNK UNK wrote in 1955 : : STOP
START `` nato cannot live on fear alone STOP
START it cannot become the source of a real atlantic community if it remains organized to deal only with the military threat which first brought it into being '' STOP
START the problem of nato is not one of machinery , of which there is an UNK , but of the will to use it STOP
START the nato council is available as an executive agency , the standing group as a high military authority STOP
START the UNK conference of UNK is available as a potential legislative authority STOP
START this machinery will not become the instrument of an atlantic community by UNK , but only when that community UNK from UNK to reality STOP
START the existence of a community is a state of mind -- a conviction that goals and values are widely shared , that effective communication is possible , that mutual trust is reasonably assured STOP
START an equally promising avenue toward atlantic community may lie through the development and expansion of the UNK STOP
START conceived as an UNK of economic cooperation , there is no reason why UNK UNK into a broader instrument of union if its members so desire STOP
START indeed it might be a more appropriate vehicle than nato for the development of a UNK UNK of the atlantic nations , because it could UNK all of the members of the atlantic community including those , like UNK and UNK , who are UNK to be associated with an essentially military alliance like aj STOP
START underlying these hopes and UNK is a conviction that the nations of the north atlantic area do indeed form a community , at least a potential community STOP
START there is nothing new in this ; ; STOP
START what is new and UNK is that the west is now but one of several powerful UNK , or `` systems '' , and that one or more of the others may UNK a UNK danger to the west STOP
START for centuries the north atlantic nations dominated the world and as long as they did they could afford the luxury of fighting each other STOP
START that time is now past and the atlantic nations , if they are to survive , must develop a UNK community , and they must also look beyond the UNK of `` western civilization '' toward a world-wide `` concert of free nations '' STOP
START 6 , STOP
START the burden of these UNK is that a broader unity among the free nations is at the core of our needs STOP
START and if we do not UNK to too much , it is also within our capacity STOP
START a realistic UNK of the need for new forms of international organization on the one hand , and our capacity to achieve them on the other , must be approached through the concept of `` community '' STOP
START history has demonstrated many times that UNK of nations based solely on the negative UNK of common danger are UNK to survive when the external danger UNK to be UNK UNK STOP
START only when a concert of nations rests on the positive foundations of shared goals and values is it likely to form a UNK instrument of long-range policy STOP
START it follows that the solution to the current UNK of the free nations is only to a very limited extent a matter of UNK new machinery of UNK and coordination STOP
START it is very much a matter of building the foundations of community STOP
START it is for these reasons that proposals for a `` new world order '' , through radical UNK of the united nations or through some sort of world UNK , are utterly UNK STOP
START in a recent book called `` world peace through world law '' , two distinguished lawyers , UNK clark and UNK UNK , call for just such an UNK of the UNK UNK their case on the world-wide fear of a nuclear UNK STOP
START i believe that these proposals , however UNK in terms of world needs , go far beyond our capacity to realize them STOP
START such proposals look to an UNK act , a kind of UNK `` social contract '' on a world-wide scale STOP
START the UNK of these proposals is in their attempt to UNK history and their assumption that because something may be desirable it is also possible STOP
START a working concept of the organic evolution of community must lead us in a different direction STOP
START the UNK of the UNK of other international UNK suggest that we have already gone beyond what was UNK feasible STOP
START our problem , therefore , is to UNK processes more UNK in their aspirations , adjusted to the real world of sovereign nation states and diverse and hostile communities STOP
START the history of the UNK that in a UNK world we must develop processes of influence and UNK rather than UNK STOP
START it is possible that international organization will ultimately UNK the UNK system , but its proper function for the immediate future is to reform and supplement that system in order to UNK UNK more compatible with an UNK world STOP
START new machinery of coordination should not be our primary objective in the UNK future -- though perhaps the `` political general staff '' of western leaders proposed by sir UNK UNK would serve a useful purpose STOP
START generally , however , there is an UNK of available machinery of coordination -- in nato , in UNK in the UNK elsewhere STOP
START the trouble with this machinery is that it is not used and the reason that it is not used is the absence of a conscious sense of community among the free nations STOP
START our proper objective , then , is the development of a new spirit , the realization of a potential community STOP
START a `` concert of free nations '' should take its UNK from the traditions of the nineteenth century concert of europe with its common values and accepted `` rules of the game '' STOP
START UNK of and by themselves mean little ; ; STOP
START the history of both the league of nations and the united nations UNK that STOP
START but a powerful sense of community , even with little or no machinery , means a great deal STOP
START that is the lesson of the nineteenth century STOP
START a realistic `` concert of free nations '' might be expected to consist of an `` inner community '' of the north atlantic nations and an `` outer community '' UNK much or all of the UNK world STOP
START the recent experiments in the new UNK movement seen by some as part of the `` san francisco renaissance '' have been as popular as they are UNK STOP
START `` it might well start a UNK like UNK UNK or UNK UNK '' , wrote UNK UNK in an UNK note in the UNK review , and he may have been right STOP
START under the general heading `` UNK '' widely UNK experiments have been carried out STOP
START UNK UNK and UNK UNK have concentrated on writing a new poetry for reading with jazz that is very closely related to both the musical forms of jazz , and the UNK of the musician STOP
START even musicians themselves have taken to writing poetry STOP
START ( UNK UNK now has poems as well as UNK written for her STOP
START ) STOP
START but the best known UNK of the new medium are UNK UNK and UNK patchen STOP
START UNK and patchen are far apart UNK and UNK in their experiments STOP
START UNK is a UNK jazz UNK , a UNK of jazz heroes , and a student of traditional as well as modern jazz STOP
START in san francisco he has worked with UNK UNK , UNK UNK , and other `` UNK '' musicians of secure reputation , thus placing himself within established jazz traditions , in addition to being a part of the san francisco `` school '' STOP
START although patchen has given previous evidence of an interest in jazz , the musical group that he works with , the chamber jazz UNK , is often ignored by jazz critics STOP
START ( UNK did not mention the los angeles appearance of patchen and the UNK , although the UNK UNK over two months STOP
START ) the stated goal of the UNK is the synthesis of jazz and `` serious '' music STOP
START UNK musicians are UNK in established jazz circles , and patchen himself has remained outside the san francisco poetry group , maintaining a UNK isolation , even though his conversion to UNK is not as extreme or as sudden as it may first appear STOP
START he had read his poetry with musicians as early as 1951 , and his entire career has been characterized by radical experiments with the form and presentation of his poetry STOP
START however , his subject matter and basic UNK have remained surprisingly consistent , and these , together with certain key poetic images , may be traced through all his work , including the new jazz experiments STOP
START from the beginning of his career , patchen has adopted an UNK approach to poetry STOP
START his first book , before the brave ( UNK ) , is a collection of poems that are almost all UNK , but after publication of this book he rejected communism , and UNK a UNK UNK , though UNK his revolutionary UNK STOP
START he spoke for a `` UNK '' that included `` all the lost and sick and UNK of the earth '' STOP
START patchen believes that the world is being destroyed by UNK and UNK people STOP
START running UNK to the destroying forces in the world are all the UNK that are UNK in man , the capacity for love and UNK , the ability to appreciate beauty STOP
START beauty as well as love is UNK , and patchen UNK a kind of moral salvation STOP
START this salvation does not take the form of a christian heaven STOP
START in UNK eyes , organized churches are as UNK as organized governments , and christian symbols , having been taken over by the UNK classes , are now agents of UNK STOP
START patchen UNK a dark kingdom which `` stands above the waters as a UNK warning man of danger from his own kind '' STOP
START the dark kingdom UNK UNK of death and other UNK UNK down to us with UNK UNK STOP
START actually heaven and the dark kingdom UNK ; ; STOP
START they form two aspects of UNK life after death STOP
START patchen has almost never used UNK poetic forms ; ; STOP
START he has UNK instead with personal UNK STOP
START much of his earlier work was conceived in terms of a `` UNK '' myth reference , which is concerned with imaginary places and beings described in UNK and UNK language STOP
START these early experiments were evidently not altogether UNK to patchen STOP
START beginning in cloth of the UNK ( 1943 ) he UNK in UNK poetry and visual art , using UNK to carry long narrative UNK of a story , as in UNK UNK , and UNK elaborate `` UNK '' in which it is impossible to distinguish between the `` art '' and the poetry STOP
START art `` UNK '' or UNK UNK did not meet all of UNK requirements for a poetic frame of reference STOP
START many of his poems UNK to be exactly contemporary and political ; ; STOP
START so during the period approximately from UNK to 1946 , patchen often used private detective stories as a myth reference , and the `` private eye '' as a myth hero STOP
START speaking in terms of UNK UNK , the `` private eye '' might appeal to the poet in search of a myth for many reasons STOP
START the private detective ( at least in the minds of UNK and readers all over the country ) is an individual hero fighting injustice STOP
START he is usually something of an UNK , he must battle the organized police force as well as recognized UNK STOP
START the private detective must UNK , as the UNK son or UNK hero does in primitive myth , on his UNK STOP
START the private detective is UNK against injustice , a humorous and UNK UNK of the UNK ; ; STOP
START most important to patchen , he was a UNK hero , and very contemporary STOP
START in 1945 , probably almost every american not only knew who sam UNK was , but had some kind of emotional feeling about him STOP
START in the UNK of a UNK UNK ( 1945 ) patchen UNK this national sentiment by making his hero , albert UNK , a private detective STOP
START but since 1945 , sam UNK has UNK a UNK ; ; STOP
START he has become friday on UNK , a UNK of arbitrary police authority STOP
START he has , like so many other secular and religious culture symbols , gone over to the side of the ruling classes STOP
START obviously , the `` private eye '' can have no more appeal for patchen STOP
START to fill the job of contemporary hero in 1955 , patchen needed someone else STOP
START it was logical that he would come up with the figure of the modern jazz musician STOP
START the revolution in jazz that took place around 1949 , the evolution from the `` UNK '' school of UNK UNK to the `` cool '' sound of miles davis and UNK UNK , lee UNK , and the whole legend of UNK parker , had made an impression on many academic and literary men STOP
START the UNK between the east coast and west coast schools of jazz , the differences between the `` hard UNK '' school of UNK , and the `` UNK '' experiments of UNK , UNK and UNK , the general differences in the UNK of white and negro musicians , all had become fairly well known to certain UNK of the public STOP
START the UNK amount of interest that the new jazz had for the younger generation must have impressed him , and he began working toward the UNK of jazz and poetry , as he had previously attempted the union of UNK art and poetry STOP
START in addition to his experiments in reading poetry to jazz , patchen is beginning to use the figure of the modern jazz musician as a myth hero in the same way he used the figure of the private detective a decade ago STOP
START in this respect , his approach to UNK is in marked contrast to UNK UNK STOP
START UNK uses many of his early poems when he UNK to jazz , including many of his chinese and japanese UNK ; ; STOP
START he usually draws some kind of comparison with the jazz tradition and the poem he is reading -- for instance , he draws the parallel between a poem he UNK about an UNK UNK waiting for the man she UNK , and who never comes , and the old UNK UNK of UNK UNK and other negro UNK -- but usually the comparison is UNK STOP
START UNK may sometimes achieve an effective UNK , but he rarely makes any effort to capture any jazz `` feeling '' in the text of his poems , UNK on his very competent musicians to supply this feeling STOP
START patchen does read some of his earlier works to music , but he has written an entire book of short poems which seem to be especially suited for reading with jazz STOP
START these new poems have only a few direct references to jazz and jazz musicians , but they show changes in UNK approach to his poetry , for he has tried to enter into and understand the emotional attitude of the jazz musician STOP
START it is difficult to draw the line between UNK and the reality of the jazz musician STOP
START everyone knows that private UNK in real life are not like sam UNK and UNK UNK , but the real and the imaginary musician are closely linked STOP
START seen by the public , the musician is the UNK UNK UNK STOP
START he is forced to play for little money , and must often take another job to live STOP
START his approach to music is highly UNK ; ; STOP
START the UNK is on UNK rather than arrangements STOP
START while he is UNK , the musician often UNK public attitudes of UNK UNK and UNK STOP
START the musician is UNK and UNK ; ; STOP
START he is far from being a literary hero , yet is a creative artist STOP
START many of these aspects will be seen as comparable to those of the ideal detective , but where the detective is active and UNK , the jazz musician is UNK , almost a victim of society STOP
START in order to write with authority either about musicians , or as a musician , patchen would have to soft UNK his UNK UNK anger , and change ( at least for the purposes of this poetry ) from a revolutionary to a victim STOP
START he must become one who knows all about the injustice in the world , but who UNK doing anything about it STOP
START this involves a shift in UNK attitude and it is a first step toward writing a new jazz poetry STOP
START he has shown considerable UNK in UNK his earliest symbols and devices to the new work , and the fact that he has kept a body of constant symbols through all of his experiments gives an unexpected continuity to his poetry STOP
START perhaps tracing some of these more important symbols through the body of his work will show that UNK new poetry is well thought out , and remains within the UNK of his work , while being suited to a new form STOP
START henry miller characterized patchen as a `` man of anger and light '' STOP
START his revolutionary anger is apparent in most of his early poems STOP
START the following passage from `` the UNK great hands '' UNK the UNK of this anger STOP
START `` anger won't help STOP
START i was born angry STOP
START angry that my father was being UNK alive in the mills ; ; STOP
START angry that none of us knew anything but UNK and UNK STOP
START angry because i was that very one UNK was supposed to be fighting for '' STOP
START this angry and UNK UNK which patchen has maintained in his poetry for almost fifteen years has been successfully UNK into a kind of UNK that is as effective as anger and still UNK his disapproval of the modern world STOP
START in his recent book , UNK for anything ( 1957 ) , one of the most important short poems -- and it is the title poem for one of the long jazz arrangements -- is written for UNK with jazz STOP
START although it does not follow the UNK rules for a UNK to be UNK , the phrases themselves carry a UNK feeling STOP
START `` i went to the city and there i did UNK , men UNK like UNK , and living like sheep STOP
START oh , can't hold the UNK of my love ! ! STOP
START can't hold her little white UNK ! ! STOP
START yes , i went to the city , and there i did UNK cry , men out of touch with the earth , and with never a glance at the sky STOP
START oh , can't hold the UNK of my love ! ! STOP
START can't hold her pure little UNK ! ! STOP
START '' patchen is still the UNK , but he writes in a UNK , UNK tone STOP
START neither of these poems is an UNK ; ; STOP
START each is so typical that it represents a prominent trend in the UNK development STOP
START patchen is repeatedly UNK with death STOP
START in many of his poems , death comes by train : a strongly UNK visual image STOP
START perhaps patchen was once involved in a train accident , and this passage from first will and testament may have been how the accident appeared to the poet when he first saw it -- if he did : `` STOP
START lord , love us , look at all the UNK UNK UNK UNK , like UNK UNK at that -- and all the eyes are talking and all the hair are moving and all the tongue are in all the UNK STOP
START let us see just how typical krim is STOP
START he is new UNK and jewish STOP
START he spent one year at the university of north carolina because thomas UNK went there STOP
START he returned to new york to work for the new UNK , to UNK a western UNK , to `` UNK the war in the UNK '' , to write UNK for UNK pictures and UNK for a UNK , then he began his career as critic for various magazines STOP
START now he has abandoned all that to be a writer STOP
START i do not want to UNK about UNK ; ; STOP
START in a certain sense , one manner of experience will be typical of any given group while another will not STOP
START but i've got news for krim : he's not typical , he's pretty special STOP
START his may UNK a certain kind of postwar new york experience , but his experience is certainly not typical of his `` UNK '' STOP
START in any case , who ever thought that new york is typical of anything ? ? STOP
START men of UNK age , aspirations , and level of UNK were typically involved in politics before the war STOP
START they did not `` UNK the war '' but they fought in it , however UNK ; ; STOP
START they UNK out some kind of formal education ; ; STOP
START they read widely and UNK ; ; STOP
START they did not fall into UNK jobs on UNK magazines , but they did whatever UNK thing they could get in order to eat ; ; STOP
START they found out who they were and what they could do , then within the limits of their talent they did it STOP
START they did not worry about `` experience '' , because experience UNK itself upon them STOP
START and they traveled out of new york STOP
START only a native new UNK could believe that new york is now or ever was a literary center STOP
START it is a UNK and public relations center , but these very facts prevent it from being a literary center because writers UNK UNK and UNK STOP
START UNK UNK consists only in his new UNK view that new york is the world ; ; STOP
START he displays what UNK call the new york mind , a state that the subject is necessarily unable to perceive in himself STOP
START the new york mind is two parts abstraction and one part UNK about the rest of the country and in fact the world STOP
START in his UNK against the literary world , krim is really struggling with the new UNK in himself , but it's a losing battle STOP
START closely related to his UNK about his UNK is UNK complicated feeling about his UNK STOP
START he writes , `` most of my friends and i were jewish ; ; STOP
START we were also literary ; ; STOP
START the combination of the jewish intellectual tradition and the UNK needed to be a writer created in my circle the most UNK and incredible UNK UNK i have ever seen or could ever have UNK STOP
START within themselves , just as people , my friends were often UNK and UNK bitter about being the UNK of this UNK UNK breed ; ; STOP
START their reading and thinking gave an extension to their normal UNK about UNK ' jewish ' in UNK , bus , UNK , movie house , any of the public places that used to make the jew of my generation UNK ( heavy UNK walking across seventh avenue without their glasses on , willing to dare the UNK as long as they didn't look like the UNK UNK of the UNK intellectual ) STOP
START '' at other points in his narrative , krim UNK UNK with UNK literary UNK , with abstraction , with his personal turning aside from the good , the true , and the beautiful of fiction in the manner of james UNK to the international , the false , and the UNK STOP
START krim says , in short , that he is a suffering jew STOP
START the only possible answer to that is , i am a suffering UNK STOP
START we all love to suffer , but some of us love to suffer more than others STOP
START had krim gone farther from new york than chapel hill , he might have discovered that large numbers of american jews do not find his new york version of the UNK lot UNK UNK STOP
START more important is the simple human point that all men suffer , and that it is a kind of UNK pride on the part of the jew to believe that his suffering is more UNK than mine or anyone UNK STOP
START this is not to deny the existence of UNK and UNK , but only to assert that these UNK have had an effect on the UNK of people who did not experience them , that among the various side effects is the local UNK of jewish writers and UNK who cry out from confusion , which they call UNK and pain STOP
START in their UNK and UNK they believe they are called upon to UNK the UNK continually of UNK and UNK STOP
START some of us have imagination and UNK too STOP
START finally , there is the UNK fact that some of the UNK american fiction is being written by jews , but it is not jewish fiction ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK and UNK UNK , through intellectual UNK , perception , through experience in fact , have obviously UNK themselves from any UNK krim UNK they might have been UNK to STOP
START UNK main attack is upon the aesthetic and the UNK apparatus of american literary culture in our day STOP
START krim was able to get an advance for a novel , and time and opportunity to write at UNK , but it was no good STOP
START `` i had natural UNK '' , he says , ' as a UNK and was UNK good at description , UNK , and most of the other UNK of the UNK trade but i was UNK by a UNK complex of thoughts and feelings that prevented me from doing more than just UNK the surface of sustained UNK '' STOP
START and again , `` how can you write when you UNK yet read ' UNK the UNK ' '' ? ? STOP
START krim came to believe that `` the novel as a form had UNK its vital meaning '' STOP
START his `` UNK jewish friends '' convinced him that education ( read `` reading '' ) was `` a must '' STOP
START he moved in a `` highly intellectual '' group in UNK village in the late UNK , becoming `` UNK '' overnight STOP
START then followed a period in which he wrote UNK for the new york times book review , the UNK , UNK , had a small piece in partisan review , and moved on to hudson , the village voice , and UNK STOP
START the work for UNK was more UNK than work for UNK `` because of the UNK UNK fear of making a UNK '' STOP
START UNK was a mere UNK of partisan review , the UNK STOP
START both magazines were `` rigid with reactionary UNK UNK ? ? STOP
START fear STOP
START '' partisan has failed , krim says , for being `` UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK UNK '' from the UNK STOP
START it was `` the creation of a UNK historical period UNK it thought it had to UNK literature and politics and UNK art of every kind with its writers UNK trying to UNK each other in UNK UNK STOP
START '' UNK , UNK , and hudson operated in an `` UNK new critical UNK '' ; ; STOP

START UNK UNK UNK , as the french jewish UNK used to say STOP
START through all this UNK , krim is UNK a traditional and by now UNK UNK , the attack on intelligence , upon the largely successful attempt of the magazines he UNK to UNK american writing from local color and other UNK of romantic corn STOP
START god knows that partisan and the rest often were , and remain , guilty of intellectual UNK STOP
START UNK UNK , UNK UNK to english , UNK but UNK fiction , and UNK to common sense have often UNK partisan , and in lesser degree , the other magazines on the list STOP
START what krim UNK , in his UNK for history and for accuracy , is that these magazines , partisan UNK , brought about a genuine revolution in the american mind from the UNK to approximately 1950 STOP
START the most obvious characteristic of contemporary american writing , apart from the beat UNK , is its UNK STOP
START the process of UNK had begun in earnest about 1912 , but the first war and the depression virtually UNK that process in its UNK STOP
START without the good magazines , without their book UNK , their UNK to european writers , without above all their awareness of literary standards , we might very well have had a generation of UNK heroes -- UNK , UNK , UNK , and i might add , UNK and UNK and UNK in verse -- and then where would we be ? ?

START the universities certainly were not doing it , nor were the popular magazines of the day STOP
START this partisan above all did ; ; STOP
START if it had never printed a word of literature its contribution to the UNK area would still be historic STOP

START partisan review and the other literary magazines helped to UNK , in the best sense , an entire generation STOP
START that these magazines also UNK the UNK of the world is unfortunate but inevitable STOP
START it is a fact of life that magazines are UNK by groups : they have to be or they wouldn't be published at all STOP

START ( there are no ) literary movements , `` there are only writers doing their work STOP

START ) when krim says mine was as severe a UNK , environment as can be UNK , he is off his UNK STOP
START he indicates that he has none of the , UNK that criticism requires , including education ; ; STOP
START the result was his inevitable UNK through , ignorance STOP
START he wasn't being , `` educated in '' those village UNK , as he claims STOP
START no one was ever educated through UNK in anything other than , to quote him again , `` UNK UNK STOP
START only '' a new york UNK would expect to find the literary life in UNK village , at any point , later than UNK UNK day STOP
START the highly intellectual minds that krim says he encountered , in the village did their work in spite of , , not because of , any village atmosphere STOP

START for the sad truth is that while one might write well without having read UNK the UNK , one is more likely , to write well if one has `` read it , and much else STOP

START we saw UNK UNK at a party once in a while , tall , UNK , UNK and UNK , and , in our opinion , the best novelist of them all except UNK , and UNK is dead STOP
START UNK the sky is red had been a small UNK and in its special way the best book to come out of the war STOP
START now he was married to a beautiful girl , had a small son , and lived in an expensive apartment and worked for the movies STOP
START on his desk was a slowly UNK treatment and UNK of the count of UNK UNK STOP
START on his UNK were some of the latest american novels , including UNK UNK the day , but he UNK read them ( they were sent by american UNK ) and wasn't especially interested in what the american writers were up to STOP
START he was interested in robert UNK the man without qualities STOP
START so were a lot of other people STOP
START he was interested in UNK UNK STOP
START he was thinking his way into a new novel , a big one , one that people had been waiting for STOP
START it was going to be hard going all the way because he UNK written seriously for a while , except for a few stories , was tired of the old method of UNK he had so successfully used in the sky is red STOP
START this one was going to be different STOP
START he had bought a little piece of property down along the coast of the hard country of UNK that he knew so well STOP
START he was going to do one or two more films for cash and then UNK it all , leave rome and its intellectual UNK and UNK life , go back to UNK STOP
START UNK seemed UNK , too STOP
START he knew all about it and had put it down in journal form in the war in a black UNK , a wonderful book not , for some strange reason , published in the UNK STOP
START he knew all about the appeal of a black UNK and UNK to a poor , southern , UNK boy STOP

START so did his friend , the young novelist UNK STOP

START these people were not talking much about it , but you , a UNK , UNK their UNK and UNK STOP
START so there we were talking around and about it STOP
START the english lady said she had to go to UNK for a while STOP
START it was a UNK because she had planned to lay a UNK at the foot of the garibaldi statue , UNK over rome in spectacular UNK from the UNK of the UNK STOP
START around that statue in the green park where children play and UNK walk in UNK and there is a UNK view of the whole city , in that park are the rows of UNK UNK of UNK fallen men , the ones who one day rushed out of the UNK san UNK and , under fire all the way , up the long , straight narrow lane to take , then lose the high ground of the UNK UNK UNK STOP
START when they lost it , the french UNK moved in , and that was the end for garibaldi that time , on 30 april UNK STOP
START once out of the gate they had charged straight up the narrow lane STOP
START we had walked it many times and UNK , UNK what a fish barrel it had been for the french STOP
START now the park is filled with UNK UNK and all the streets in the immediate area have the full and proper names of the men who fell STOP
START we were at a party once and heard an UNK young european call that UNK charge UNK STOP
START our UNK was a huge , UNK american UNK who had been a UNK UNK all across france in UNK STOP
START he said it was UNK UNK to order men to make a charge like that , no matter who gave the order and what for STOP
START `` oh , it would be UNK all right '' , the european said STOP
START `` we would see it that way , but it was UNK then STOP
START it was the last time in history anybody could do something UNK like that '' STOP
START i thought : who is older now ? ? STOP
START old world and new world STOP
START the UNK looked at him , UNK and UNK , angry STOP
START he had made an assault once with UNK men STOP
START it was a picked assault company STOP
START they went up against an UNK unit of comparable size , over a little rise of ground , over an open field STOP
START object -- a village UNK STOP
START they made it , killed every last one of the UNK , took the village on schedule STOP
START when it was over , eight of his company were still alive and all eight were wounded STOP
START the whole thing , from the moment when they UNK heavily off the UNK , spread out and moved into position just behind the cover of that slight rise of ground and then UNK off , took maybe between twenty and thirty minutes STOP
START the UNK looked at him , let the color drain out of his face , UNK , and looked down into his drink , a bad UNK made with raw italian UNK STOP
START `` UNK '' , he said UNK STOP
START `` UNK me '' , the european said STOP
START `` i am not familiar with the expression '' STOP
START the apartment where we were talking that afternoon in march faced onto the street UNK men had charged up and along STOP
START across the way from the apartment building is a UNK house , shot to hell that day in UNK , and left that way as a UNK STOP
START there is a UNK UNK on the wall STOP

START i have seen UNK UNK across the UNK roof STOP
START the english lady really wanted to put a UNK on the garibaldi monument on the UNK of april STOP
START she had her reasons for this STOP
START for one thing , there wasn't going to be any UNK at all this year STOP
START there were a few reasons for that , too : garibaldi had been taken up and UNK by the communists UNK STOP
START therefore the government wanted no part of him STOP
START ( it is sort of as if our government should decide to UNK washington or lincoln for the same reason STOP
START ) and then there were UNK matters , the matter of UNK UNK STOP
START there was a new pope and the UNK was making itself heard and felt these days STOP
START as it happens the english lady is a good catholic herself , but of more liberal political UNK STOP
START nothing was going to be done this year to UNK UNK UNK and UNK defense of rome STOP
START all that the english lady wanted to do was to walk up to the monument and lay a UNK at its base STOP
START this would show that UNK , even a UNK living in rome , UNK STOP
START and then there were other things STOP
START some of the UNK UNK in the park are of young UNK who fought and died for garibaldi STOP
START she also mentioned leaving a little UNK of flowers at the UNK of UNK di UNK STOP
START it is hard for me to know how i feel about UNK di UNK STOP
START i suffer from mixed feelings STOP
START he was a UNK , UNK , and sensitive young poet STOP
START his UNK shows an intense , UNK , UNK face STOP
START he UNK over rome one day during the early days of UNK and scattered UNK over the city , UNK the UNK STOP
START he was never heard of again STOP
START he is thought either to have been killed by the UNK as soon as he UNK or to have killed himself by flying out to sea and UNK his plane STOP
START he was , thus , an early and spectacular victim STOP
START and there is something so UNK romantic about it all STOP
START he really didn't know how to fly STOP
START he had UNK on UNK once before STOP
START UNK had it ( for UNK is the soul of rome ) that a famous american dancer of the time had paid for both the planes STOP
START it was absurd and dramatic STOP

START most UNK , even some UNK , know it by the old name STOP
START faced with a gesture like di UNK , i find usually that my UNK are closer to those of my UNK friend STOP
START the things that happened in police station UNK were UNK , UNK , and most often UNK STOP
START no poetry , no UNK , no dancers STOP
START that is how the real routine of resistance goes on , and its strength is directly UNK to the number of UNK people who can let themselves be taken to pieces , piece by piece , without UNK STOP
START it is an UNK business and there are few , if any , UNK for them STOP
START i keep thinking of a young woman i knew during the occupation in UNK STOP
START she was from UNK STOP
START she had been picked up by the russians , questioned in connection with some UNK , UNK to life UNK for UNK STOP
START she UNK , UNK through the usual mine fields , under UNK wire , was shot at , UNK a river , and we finally picked her up in UNK STOP

START i understand very well about UNK di UNK and how his action is symbolic STOP
START the trouble is that like many symbols it doesn't seem a very realistic one STOP
START the english lady wanted to pay tribute to garibaldi and to UNK di UNK , but she wasn't going to be here to do it STOP
START were any of us interested enough in the idea to do it for her , by UNK so to speak ? ? STOP
START there was a pretty thorough silence at that point STOP
START my UNK UNK coffee , UNK against the side of the cup , UNK as UNK as a UNK STOP
START i thought : what the hell ? ? STOP
START why not ? ? STOP
START i said i would do it for her STOP

START i UNK the english lady STOP
START i hate UNK UNK and have been known to make a UNK out of myself just to prevent one STOP
START i also had and have feelings about garibaldi STOP
START like every UNK i can't escape the romantic tradition of brave UNK , UNK lost causes STOP
START though UNK fight was small UNK compared to UNK charge -- which , like all southerners , i view in almost UNK terms , fallen UNK , UNK i associated the two STOP
START and to top it all i am often UNK on purpose , trying to prove to myself that i am not afraid of sentiment STOP
START so much for all that STOP
START the english lady was pleased and enthusiastic STOP
START she gave me the names of some people who would surely help pay for the flowers and might even march up to the monument with me STOP

START first , we can encourage responsibility by establishing as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the definition of objectives and the assessment of costs STOP
START second , we can make assistance for particular projects UNK on the consistency of such projects with the program STOP
START third , we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development which are adapted to the UNK objectives and resources STOP
START this includes assistance in -- UNK the basic economic , financial , technological , and educational information on which UNK depends ; ; STOP
START UNK the needs and requirements over time of broad UNK of the economy , such as transport , agriculture , communication , industry , and power ; ; STOP
START UNK the financial mechanisms of the economy in ways that will promote growth without UNK ; ; STOP
START and administrative practices which will make possible the more effective review and UNK of programs once established STOP
START we must use common sense in applying conditions STOP
START STOP
START the application of conditions in the allocation of aid funds cannot , of course , be mechanical STOP
START it must be recognized that countries at different stages of development have very different capabilities of meeting such conditions STOP
START to insist on a level of performance in UNK and UNK completely beyond the capabilities of the UNK country would result in the UNK of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage more rapid growth STOP
START in the more primitive areas , where the capacity to UNK and UNK external assistance is limited , some activities may be of such obvious UNK that we may decide to support them before a well worked out program is available STOP
START thus , we might provide limited assistance in such fields as education , essential transport , communications , and agricultural improvement despite the absence of acceptable country programs STOP
START in such a case , however , we would encourage the UNK country to get on with its UNK task , supply it with substantial technical assistance in UNK that task , and make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance to the UNK development was UNK upon UNK progress being made STOP
START at the other end of the spectrum , where the more advanced countries can be UNK upon to make well thought through decisions as to project UNK within a consistent program , we should be prepared to UNK substantially from detailed project approval as the basis for UNK assistance and to move toward long-term support , in cooperation with other developed countries , of the essential foreign exchange requirements of the UNK development program STOP
START d STOP
START encouraging self-help STOP
START 1 STOP
START the reasons for UNK self-help STOP
START a systematic approach to development UNK and UNK is one important kind of self-help STOP
START there are many others STOP
START it is UNK important that the new UNK program should encourage all of them , since the main UNK for development must come from the less developed countries themselves STOP
START external aid can only be marginal , although the UNK , as in the case of the marshall plan , can be decisive STOP
START external aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help STOP
START UNK , therefore , should increasingly be designed to provide UNK for countries to take the steps that only they themselves can take STOP
START aid advice is not interference STOP
START STOP
START in establishing conditions of self-help , it is important that we not expect countries to UNK themselves in our image STOP
START open societies can take many forms , and within very broad limits UNK must be free to set their own goals and to UNK their own institutions to achieve those goals STOP
START on the other hand , it is no interference with sovereignty to point out defects where they exist , such as that a plan calls for factories without power to run them , or for institutions without trained personnel to staff them STOP
START once we have made clear that we are UNK concerned with a UNK development potential , we can be UNK in UNK the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur STOP
START 2 STOP
START the range of self-help STOP
START the major areas of self-help are the following : ( a ) the effective UNK of resources STOP
START this includes not only development UNK , but also establishing tax policies designed to raise UNK resources for investment ; ; STOP
START fiscal and UNK policies designed to prevent serious UNK ; ; STOP
START and UNK policies aimed to UNK the financial and UNK resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury consumption by a few STOP
START ( b ) the reduction of dependence on external sources STOP
START this includes UNK UNK crises , with adequate attention to reducing dependence on UNK and UNK realistic exchange rates to encourage UNK industries and UNK UNK STOP
START it also includes providing for the training of UNK to operate projects after they are completed STOP
START ( c ) UNK the energies of the entire population STOP
START for both economic and political reasons all UNK of the population must be able to share in the growth of a country STOP
START otherwise , development will not lead to UNK stability STOP
START ( d ) UNK in government STOP
START in many societies , what we regard as UNK , UNK , and personal influence are so accepted as consistent with the UNK of UNK and so integral a part of routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their UNK will be regarded by the local leadership as not only UNK but UNK STOP
START yet an economy cannot get the most out of its resources if UNK , UNK , and UNK are widespread STOP
START moreover , UNK by us of such practices results in serious waste and UNK of aid resources and in the long run UNK UNK sentiment of a kind UNK UNK to our political interest STOP
START some of the most dramatic successes of communism in winning local support can be traced to the identification -- correct or not -- of communist UNK with personal UNK and UNK UNK with UNK STOP
START a requirement of reasonably honest administration may be UNK UNK in the short run , but it is UNK essential in the long run STOP
START 3 STOP
START UNK on self-help STOP
START the united states can use its aid as an UNK to self-help by UNK with aid on a sustained basis , UNK to UNK needs , to those countries making serious efforts in self-help STOP
START in many instances it can UNK or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such efforts STOP
START there are other countries where , with UNK UNK , we may be able by our aid to give UNK to those groups in government which would like to press forward with economic and social reform measures to promote growth STOP
START governments are rarely UNK STOP
START but there will be still other countries where , despite the UNK of the level of self-help , we shall UNK it wise , for political or military reasons , to give substantial economic assistance STOP
START even in these cases we should promote self-help by making it clear that our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to UNK STOP
START e STOP
START encouraging a long-term approach STOP
START 1 STOP
START development requires a long-term approach STOP
START STOP
START the most fundamental concept of the new approach to economic aid is the UNK of our attention , our resources , and our energies on the effort to promote the economic and social development of the less developed countries STOP
START this is not a UNK goal STOP
START to have any success in this effort , we must ourselves view it as an enterprise UNK over a considerable number of years , and we must encourage the UNK of our aid to view it in the same fashion STOP
START most of our aid will go to those UNK UNK STOP
START STOP
START how long it will take to show substantial success in this effort will vary greatly from country to country STOP
START in several significant cases , such as india , a decade of concentrated effort can UNK these countries into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic and social progress with little or no UNK assistance STOP
START these cases in which light is already visible at the other end of the UNK are ones which over the next few years will UNK the UNK of our capital assistance STOP
START gradually others will move up to the same level STOP
START STOP
START the number of countries thus favorably situated is small , but their peoples constitute over half of the population of the UNK world STOP
START UNK , over the decade of the sixties , we can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big push into UNK growth STOP
START in still others which are barely on the UNK of the transition into UNK , the decade can bring significant progress in UNK the slow process of developing their human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded range of UNK activities is possible STOP
START aid is a long-term process STOP
START STOP
START the whole program must be conceived of as an effort , UNK over a considerable number of years , to UNK the basic social and economic conditions in the less developed world STOP
START it must be recognized as a UNK tool designed to prevent political and military crises such as those recently confronted in laos and cuba STOP
START it is not a tool for dealing with these crises after they have UNK STOP
START 2 STOP
START the specific reasons for a long-term approach STOP
START ( a ) the need to budget a period of years STOP
START many of the individual projects for which development assistance is required call for expenditures over UNK periods STOP
START UNK , river development UNK , transportation networks , educational systems require years to construct STOP
START moreover , on complex projects , design work must be completed and orders for machinery and equipment placed months or even years before construction can UNK STOP
START thus , as a development program is being launched , commitments and obligations must be entered into in a given year which may exceed by UNK or UNK the expenditures to be made in that year STOP
START the capital expansion programs of business firms involve UNK UNK and the same is true of country development programs STOP
START ( b ) the need to plan investment programs STOP
START more UNK , several of the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for at least 5 years forward and UNK for considerably more than that if they are to be sure that the various UNK activities involved are all to take place in the proper sequence STOP
START without such forward planning , investment funds are UNK because manufacturing facilities are completed before there is power to operate them or before there is transport to service them ; ; STOP
START or a skilled labor force is trained before there are plants available in which they can be employed STOP
START ( c ) the need to UNK country resources STOP
START most important of all , the less developed countries must be persuaded to take the necessary steps to UNK and UNK their own resources STOP
START they must be induced to establish the necessary tax , fiscal , UNK , and UNK policies STOP
START they must be persuaded to UNK the other necessary self-help measures which are described in the preceding section STOP
START the taking of these steps involves tough internal policy decisions STOP
START moreover , once these steps are taken , they may require years to make themselves felt STOP
START they must , therefore , be related to long-range development plans STOP
START 3 STOP
START providing an UNK STOP
START if the less developed countries are to be persuaded to UNK a long-term approach , the united states , as the principal UNK of external aid , must be prepared to give long-term commitments STOP
START in this , as in so many aspects of our development assistance activities , the UNK effects of the UNK we take are the most important ones STOP
START the extent to which we can UNK the less developed countries to UNK their own resources , to set targets toward which they should be working , to establish in the light of this forward perspective the most UNK UNK for their immediate attention , and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves , all on a realistic long-term basis , will depend UNK on the UNK we place before them STOP
START if they feel that we are taking a long-term view of their problems and are prepared to enter into reasonably long-term association with them in their development activities , they will be much more likely to UNK the difficult tasks required STOP
START perhaps the most important UNK for them will be clear evidence that where other countries have done this kind of home work we have responded with long-term commitments STOP
START you have heard him tell these young people that during his almost 50 years of service in the congress he has seen the UNK and the UNK and the UNK , the UNK and UNK and UNK , come and go and that we are passing on to them the UNK nation that mankind has ever known STOP
START then i have seen the pride of country well in the eyes of these young people STOP
START so , i say , UNK , god UNK you and keep you for many years not only for this body but for the united states of america and the free world STOP
START you remember the words of president kennedy a week or so ago , when someone asked him when he was in canada , and dean UNK was in europe , and vice president UNK was in asia , `` who is running the store '' ? ? STOP
START and he said , `` the same fellow who has been running it , sam rayburn '' STOP
START general leave to extend STOP

START it is notably significant that so many members from both sides of the UNK express their respect and UNK for our beloved speaker , the UNK sam rayburn STOP
START i UNK UNK from adding the usual distinction of saying that he was from the state of texas STOP
START i did so because i agree with so many here today , that he is the beloved speaker of all the people of the united states STOP
START for the dignity , the influence , and the power of the legislative branch of our government -- it is a privilege for us to do honor to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all the people of our country STOP
START to honor him is to honor ourselves STOP
START in this my first year as a member of this body i have experienced many UNK moments STOP
START many of these experiences are so important that they will be UNK forever by me STOP
START and , like many of you here present , i hold as the UNK of all , the occasion of my first meeting with the UNK speaker of the house STOP
START at that time , he UNK me the UNK of his busy UNK for such length as i may need , to speak about my background , my hopes , my views on various national and local UNK , and any problems that i may have been UNK with at the time STOP
START he was UNK in his handling of all subjects with me and UNK wise in his counsel STOP
START in conclusion , he wished me well -- and as UNK and UNK as this UNK gentleman could express himself , he asked to be remembered to my wife and children STOP
START in my short period here i believe that at no time has he been otherwise than the most popular man on both sides of the UNK STOP
START he is most effective in the ordinary business of the house , and in the legislative UNK of this session , he easily rose to great occasion -- even at the height of UNK and exciting legislative struggle -- and as the nation UNK these UNK , he rose , even as admitted by those who UNK with him , to the proportions of a hero and a UNK partisan STOP
START i am highly UNK today to UNK the brilliant career of this UNK UNK STOP
START he will ever be my example as a true UNK ; ; STOP
START one who is thoroughly human , who affects no dignity , and who is UNK with real ability , genuine worth , and UNK UNK -- all dedicated to secure the best interests of the country he has loved and served so long STOP

START it is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for me to add my voice to the great and distinguished UNK of my colleagues in this UNK of UNK , respect , and affection for speaker sam rayburn STOP
START in this hour of crisis , the wisdom , the dedication , the UNK force that he represents in current american government is an almost indispensable source of strength STOP
START he has become in this half century the grand old man of american history STOP
START it seems to me that the prayers of the whole free world must rise like some vast UNK to providence that sam UNK UNK and his life remain UNK through the coming decades STOP
START here briefly in this humble tribute i have sought for some simple and UNK UNK that would define the UNK service of this UNK to his country STOP
START but the task is beyond me because i hold it impossible to UNK in a sentence or two the complicated and UNK contributions sam rayburn has made as an individual , as a UNK , as a UNK and as a leader and UNK , to the UNK progress of this nation STOP
START it happens that i am a UNK from ohio and that i feel deeply about the needs , the aspirations , the interests of my district and my state STOP
START what sam UNK life UNK to us all is the magnificent lesson in political science that one can UNK and with absolute dedication represent the seemingly UNK interests of one's own community , one's own district , one's own state , and by that help himself represent even better the UNK and scope of the problems of this the greatest nation of all time STOP
START for sam rayburn never UNK UNK , his home community , and he never UNK texas STOP
START in the same way i like to think we UNK our loyalty as UNK to our community , our district , our state STOP
START and , if we follow the rayburn pattern , as UNK or by an UNK political sense i like to think i have followed it , then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our services to our country STOP
START for what sam UNK life in this house UNK us is that loyalty and character are not UNK and there is no such thing as being for your country and UNK your district STOP
START there is no such thing as being UNK about national affairs but UNK about home needs STOP
START the two are as one STOP
START this may not be the greatest but it certainly comes close to being the greatest lesson sam UNK career , up to this hour , UNK all of us who would UNK to distinction in political life under our processes of government STOP
START more than that , sam rayburn is the very living symbol of an UNK UNK so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count some of his best friends in the opposition STOP
START through the most UNK UNK of political controversy and the most UNK fought national and presidential campaigns his character UNK as an example of dignity and UNK , UNK and UNK STOP
START sam rayburn has never had to look back at any of his most UNK UNK and ever feel UNK of his conduct as a UNK under fire or his political UNK in the heat of UNK ambitions STOP
START this means much to the american tradition STOP
START it is an answer in its way , individual and highly dramatic , to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily UNK in its campaign characteristics STOP
START and the name rayburn is one of the most dominant in the history of american politics for the last half century STOP
START it is , i insist , hard to define the rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it is so massive and so widespread and so complicated , and because it goes so deep STOP
START but this we know : here is a great life that in every area of american politics gives the american people occasion for pride and that has UNK the democratic process with the most UNK qualities of honor , UNK , and UNK STOP

START i pay my personal tribute to sam rayburn , UNK UNK and great american , not only because today he UNK a record of having served as speaker of the house of representatives more than twice as long as henry clay , but because of the contributions he has made to the welfare of the people of the nation during his almost half century of service as a member of congress STOP
START speaker rayburn has not limited his leadership as a UNK to his direction of the house in the UNK chair STOP

START no one has sponsored more progressive and important legislation than has sam rayburn STOP

START origin of state automobile practices STOP
START the practice of state-owned vehicles for use of employees on business dates back over forty years STOP
START at least one state vehicle was in existence in UNK STOP
START the state presently UNK UNK UNK vehicles in comparison to approximately 200 in 1940 STOP
START the automobile maintenance unit , or motor pool , came into existence in UNK and has been responsible for UNK maintenance and management of state-owned transportation since that time STOP
START the motor pool has made exceptional progress in UNK management including establishment of cost UNK systems , records keeping , analyses of vehicle use , and UNK UNK in vehicle operation STOP
START cars were operated in 1959 for an average UNK per mile STOP
START purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly to all state purchases STOP
START unit prices to the state are considerably lower than to the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state sales or federal UNK taxes STOP
START vehicle purchase , assignment and use policies STOP
START the UNK role in policy determination concerning state-owned vehicles has been confined almost exclusively to UNK funds for vehicles STOP
START the meaningful policies governing the purchase , assignment , use and management of state vehicles have been shaped by the state's administrative officers STOP
START meaningful policies include : ( a ) kinds of cars the state should own , ( b ) when cars should be UNK , ( c ) the need and assignment of vehicles , ( d ) use of cars in UNK of mileage allowances , ( e ) employees taking cars home , and ( f ) need for UNK insurance on state automobiles STOP
START a review of these policies indicates : ( 1 ) STOP
START the state purchases and UNK grades of cars according to need and position status of UNK and use of vehicle STOP
START ( 2 ) STOP
START the purchase of UNK ( economy ) cars is being made currently on a test basis STOP
START ( 3 ) STOP
START cars are UNK mostly on a UNK basis in the interest of economy STOP
START ( 4 ) STOP
START the factors governing need and assignment of cars are flexible according to circumstances STOP
START ( 5 ) STOP
START UNK efforts have been made to replace high mileage allowances with state automobiles STOP
START ( 6 ) STOP
START it is reasonably economical for the state to have UNK UNK state cars at their homes STOP
START ( 7 ) STOP
START the state has recently undertaken UNK insurance for UNK of state cars STOP
START automobile practices in other states STOP
START a survey of practices and policies in other states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveals several points for comparison with rhode UNK practices STOP
START UNK states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state business STOP
START two other states provide vehicles , but only with legislative approval STOP
START states which provide automobiles for employees assign them UNK to the agency , the individual , or to a central pool STOP
START UNK states operate a central motor pool for acquisition , allocation and maintenance of state-owned vehicles STOP
START nineteen states report laws , policies or regulations for UNK state vehicles in UNK of paying mileage allowances STOP
START of these states the average `` UNK '' point ( at which a car is substituted for allowances ) is UNK miles per year STOP
START mileage allowances STOP
START mileage allowances for state employees are of two types : ( a ) actual mileage and ( b ) fixed monthly allowances STOP
START actual mileage allowances are UNK UNK allowed employees for the use of UNK vehicles on state business at the rate of UNK per mile STOP
START fixed monthly allowances are UNK for the same purpose except on a UNK basis STOP
START both allowances are governed by conditions and restrictions set forth in detail in the state's travel regulations STOP
START rhode UNK UNK rate of UNK per mile for use of UNK cars UNK favorably with other UNK rates STOP
START the average of UNK rates is UNK per mile STOP
START rhode UNK rate of UNK per mile is considerably lower than UNK rates in the federal government and in industry UNK which approximate a UNK per mile average STOP
START actual mileage allowances are UNK and not UNK expensive for the state STOP
START the travel regulations , requirements and procedures governing UNK are controlled properly and not UNK UNK STOP
START fixed monthly allowances are a UNK subject STOP
START they have a great advantage in ease of UNK time and payment STOP
START however , they UNK themselves to UNK and inadequate control measures STOP
START flat payments over UNK per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of state-owned vehicles STOP
START travel allowances STOP
START travel allowances , including UNK , have been revised by administrative officials recently and compare favorably with other UNK allowances STOP
START with few exceptions UNK on state business are allowed actual travel expenses and UNK per day UNK STOP
START travel allowances are UNK and UNK little problem in administration and UNK control STOP
START origin of state automobile practices STOP
START general background STOP
START it is difficult to UNK the time of origin of the state purchasing automobiles for use of employees in rhode island STOP
START few records are available concerning the subject prior to 1940 STOP
START those that are available UNK little light STOP
START the UNK of motor vehicles indicates that at least one state automobile was registered as far back as UNK STOP
START it should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles is at least forty years old STOP
START the best reason that can be advanced for the state UNK the practice was the UNK of expanded highway construction during the UNK and UNK STOP
START at that time highway engineers traveled rough and UNK roads to accomplish their duties STOP
START using UNK vehicles was a personal UNK for such employees , and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly UNK STOP
START once the principle was established , the increase in state-owned vehicles came rapidly STOP
START and reasons other than employee need contributed to the growth STOP
START table 1 immediately below shows the rate of growth of vehicles and employees STOP
START this rate of increase does not UNK anything in itself STOP
START it does not indicate loose management , UNK controls or poor policy STOP
START but it does show that automobiles have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employees STOP
START in the past twenty years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now STOP
START whether there were too few automobiles in 1940 or too many now is UNK STOP
START the fact is simply that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them STOP
START history and operation of the motor pool STOP
START while the origin of state-owned automobiles may be UNK , subsequent developments concerning the assignment , use , and management of state automobiles can be related more clearly STOP
START prior to UNK , automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which assigned STOP
START this responsibility included all phases of management STOP
START it UNK determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles , who was to drive , when and where UNK were to be made , where UNK and automobile services were to be obtained and other UNK matters STOP
START in UNK , however , the nation was at war STOP
START UNK and automobile UNK were UNK commodities STOP
START the state was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual STOP
START it met these problems by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit ( more UNK called the motor pool ) , a UNK operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation STOP
START the motor pool then , as now , had UNK facilities in providence and other UNK located throughout the state STOP
START it was UNK the responsibility of the department of public works and was financed on a UNK fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the UNK operation STOP
START in 1951 the UNK operation was transferred to the UNK department of administration , an agency established as the central staff and UNK department of the state government STOP
START the management of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in a recent report in the following manner : `` STOP
START under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made STOP
START the agencies of government are now UNK for the actual cost of services provided to each UNK car rather than the prior uniform charge for all cars STOP
START whereas the maintenance UNK fund had in the past sustained losses considerably beyond expectations , the introduction of the UNK system plus other control UNK has resulted in keeping the fund on a proper working basis STOP
START one indication of the UNK of the new management is found in the fact that during the period UNK , while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased UNK , the total maintenance cost increased only UNK STOP
START `` STOP
START in order to further UNK the management of UNK vehicles , on july 1 , 1958 , the actual title to every vehicle was transferred , by executive order , to the division of methods , research and office services STOP
START the objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management , assignment , and replacement of all vehicles STOP
START ( note : so far as state police cars are concerned , only their replacement is under this division ) STOP
START this tied in closely with the current attempt to UNK state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs ( in light of UNK ) become excessive STOP
START moreover , it allows the present management to UNK vehicles so that mileage will be more UNK distributed throughout the UNK ; ; STOP
START for example , if one UNK puts on UNK miles per year and another UNK UNK miles per year , their cars will be UNK so that both cars will have UNK miles after two years , rather than UNK miles ( and related higher maintenance costs ) and UNK miles respectively '' STOP
START the motor pool is a completely UNK and UNK operation STOP
START it UNK all types of vehicle maintenance , but UNK more on `` service station activities '' than on extensive vehicle UNK STOP
START it contracts with outside UNK UNK for much of the latter work STOP
START where the pool UNK is in its UNK of maintenance and UNK studies and analyses STOP
START pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per UNK of each vehicle , the miles traveled in one year or three years , the periods when vehicle costs become excessive , and when cars should be UNK for sound UNK STOP
START from this , motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data STOP
START in UNK , vehicles averaged an operating cost of UNK per mile STOP
START based on this figure and considering UNK costs of vehicles , pool personnel have determined that travel in excess of 10,000 miles UNK is more economical by state car than by payment of allowances for use of UNK vehicles STOP
START they estimate further that with sufficient experience and when UNK of UNK cars is UNK , the UNK point may be reduced to UNK miles of travel per year STOP
START table 2 shows operating cost data of state vehicles selected at random STOP
START one matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central UNK facilities STOP
START present pool quarters at two locations in providence are UNK , UNK and , in general , make for UNK operation in terms of UNK of personnel and UNK of such operational needs as stock and UNK equipment STOP
START good facilities would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle costs even more STOP
START purchasing practices STOP
START the purchase of state-owned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state STOP
START UNK are made by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will be made STOP
START UNK are evaluated by the division of purchases with the assistance of pool staff , and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made to the UNK responsible UNK STOP
START unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public STOP
START the reasons are obvious : ( 1 ) the state is buying in quantity , and ( 2 ) it has no federal UNK or state sales tax to pay STOP
START until 1958 the state was also entitled to a special type of UNK discount through the dealers STOP
START in that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state motor pool , cars are paid for with funds UNK to the agencies but transferred to the UNK fund mentioned earlier STOP
START this is a normal governmental procedure which reflects more accurately UNK principles STOP
START the assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is another matter to be covered in detail later STOP
START vehicle purchase , assignment , and use policies STOP
START probably the most important of all matters for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase , assignment , use , and management of state vehicles STOP
START the UNK role in policy determination in this area for years has been confined almost solely to the amount of funds UNK UNK for the purchase and operation of vehicles STOP
START the more meaningful policies have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state -- the director of administration STOP
START the rhode island property tax STOP
START there was a time some years ago when local UNK by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well STOP
START for many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several UNK to the state from the UNK of the general property tax STOP
START this tax was UNK in UNK STOP
START since that time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial UNK on the state which could not have been UNK in earlier years STOP
START at the same time there has been an UNK and expansion of municipal services as well STOP
START thus , there has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and , in addition , must give assistance to its local governments STOP
START this financial assistance from the state has become necessary because the local governments themselves found the property tax , or at least at the rates then existing , UNK for their requirements STOP
START consequently there have developed several forms of UNK and shared taxes , as well as the UNK grant to local governments for general purposes whose UNK accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level STOP
START UNK state aid , the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by UNK the property tax STOP
START this is being done both by the UNK of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property UNK UNK or ignored STOP
START UNK of tangible movable property in rhode island has been generally of a `` hands off '' nature due possibly to several reasons : ( 1 ) local assessors , in the main , are not well paid and have inadequate office UNK , ( 2 ) the numerous categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely difficult , and ( 3 ) the UNK of the majority of assessors in UNK this type of property STOP
START problems of UNK personal property STOP
START among the many problems in the UNK of personal property , and of movable tangible property in particular , two are significant : ( 1 ) UNK , ( 2 ) fair and UNK assessment of value STOP
START these problems are not local to rhode island , but are recognized as common to all states STOP
START UNK of property STOP
START although the laws of the various states , in general , specify the UNK of property , i.e, residence or UNK of the owner , or location of the property , the exceptions regarding boats , UNK , mobile homes , etc, seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper UNK point for assessment STOP
START rhode island law UNK that all real estate is UNK in the town in which it is situated STOP
START it also provides for the UNK of all personal property , UNK to UNK of the state , both tangible and UNK , and the tangible personal property of UNK in this state STOP
START in UNK personal property , it specifically UNK `` all ships or vessels , at home or abroad '' STOP
START UNK property is UNK wherever the owner has a place of UNK the greater portion of the year STOP
START although a similar UNK for tangible property is mentioned in the statute , this is UNK out by the provision that definite kinds of property `` and all other tangible property '' situated or being in any town is UNK where the property is situated STOP
START this would seem to UNK the tax UNK of all movable personal property at its location on december 31 STOP
START both boats and aircraft would fall within this category , as well as motor vehicles STOP
START the location of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration , and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle as being situated where it is UNK STOP
START obviously , it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the UNK day of december STOP
START in view of the acceptance UNK the status of motor vehicles for tax purposes , in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft STOP
START a recent example of this problem is the flying of six UNK , on december 31 , 1960 , from the newport UNK in UNK , to the north central UNK in UNK STOP
START this situation resulted in both towns UNK the tax , and probably UNK STOP
START UNK bases its claim on the general provision of the law that `` all UNK property , both tangible and UNK , shall be UNK to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his actual place of UNK for the larger portion of the twelve ( 12 ) months next preceding the first day of april in each year '' STOP
START the UNK tax UNK , in turn , claims the tax under the provision of law `` and all other tangible personal property situated or being in any town , in or upon any place of storage shall be UNK to such person in the town where said property is situated '' STOP
START assessment of value STOP
START this problem of fair and UNK assessment of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair UNK is dependent on local assessors , who in general are UNK and part-time personnel taking an UNK approach to the problem STOP
START this accounts for the wide UNK in assessment practices of movable tangible property in the various UNK in rhode island STOP
START this condition will undoubtedly continue until such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established , or through mutual agreement of the local UNK officials for a method of standard assessment practice to be adopted STOP
START the rhode island public UNK council in its publication once UNK : `` STOP
START the most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the state take over full responsibility for UNK all UNK property STOP
START an adequately UNK and equipped state UNK office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far toward producing UNK UNK on all properties throughout the state STOP
START a single UNK UNK unit would eliminate the differences and UNK that are inherent in a system of UNK different and independent UNK units '' STOP
START the institute of public administration , in its report to the state fiscal study commission in 1959 , recommended `` UNK and UNK all aspects of property tax administration in a single state agency UNK organized and equipped for the job '' STOP
START the resulting UNK , it was declared , `` would be similar to that which is in successful operation in a number of metropolitan counties as large or larger than rhode island '' STOP
START practices in rhode island STOP
START to determine the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property , a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in rhode island STOP
START the UNK from each individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case STOP
START there are legitimate reasons for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among the public officials in each town STOP
START these opinions of the assessors are of significance in UNK what their thinking seems to be at the present time STOP
START in UNK to a question of whether they now tax boats , UNK and other movable property excluding automobiles , nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not STOP
START the UNK of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different UNK STOP
START one UNK checked boats only , another trailers and UNK , one mentioned house trailers , and two others referred to trailers without UNK the type STOP
START in two cases , UNK only were indicated STOP
START it is difficult to UNK exactly what was meant in each individual situation , but the conclusion may be drawn that 21 towns do not UNK movable personal property , and of the remainder only certain types are UNK for tax purposes STOP
START boats were indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats STOP
START it would seem , then , that movable property and equipment is not UNK as a whole but that certain types are UNK in towns where this is bound to be UNK for that particular kind of personal property STOP
START so few answered the question relating to their efforts to UNK movable property that the results are UNK STOP
START only four towns indicated that they made any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind STOP
START of greater interest is a question as to whether movable property was UNK according to its location or ownership STOP
START fifteen stated that it was according to location , four by residence of the owner , and nineteen did not answer STOP
START UNK assessors stated that they were in favor of improved means for UNK movable personal property , and only five were opposed STOP
START seven others expressed no opinion STOP
START on this point there was fairly general agreement that assessors would like to do more than they are doing now STOP
START it is not clear , however , whether they are thinking of all movable property or only of boats , trailers , aircraft or certain other types of personal property whose assessment would be UNK to their particular towns STOP
START another question that was asked of the assessors was whether they UNK the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner STOP
START UNK voted for assessment by the town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town in which the owner UNK STOP
START ten others made no UNK STOP
START of those who have an opinion , it seems that assessment by location is preferred STOP
START there was one vote for location being the place where the property is situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment date STOP
START to UNK , it may be said that there is no one prevailing practice in rhode island with respect to the UNK of movable property , that assessors would like to see an improvement , and of those who have an opinion , that assessment by the town of location is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge STOP
START the need for greater knowledge is evident from their UNK STOP
START boats as personal property STOP
START UNK of boats STOP
START interest has been shown for a number of years by local assessors in the possibility of UNK boats STOP
START assessors in rhode island are charged not only with placing a UNK upon real and personal property , but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax `` a sum not less than nor more than '' a specified amount as ordered by a city council or financial town meeting STOP
START it has been obvious to the assessors , particularly those in shore communities , that boats UNK the largest category of tangible personal property which they have been unable to reach STOP
START through their professional organization , the rhode island tax officials association the question of UNK boats long has been UNK and discussed STOP
START no satisfactory solution has been found , but this is due more to the difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or UNK on the part of the assessors STOP
START it has been estimated that the value of boats in rhode island waters is something in excess of fifty million dollars , excluding commercial boats STOP
START it is obvious that this is a potential and UNK source of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to UNK STOP
START it is known that at least five towns ( UNK , UNK , UNK , newport and UNK ) place some value on some boats for tax purposes STOP
START however , few are UNK , and the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on the date of assessment of town UNK STOP
START no one really knows how many boats there actually are or what their UNK value may be STOP
START slightly more than UNK boats were registered with the coast guard prior to the recent passage of the state boating law STOP
START only a few more than 10,000 boats had been registered with the division of UNK and rivers at the end of the 1960 boating season , but many had been taken out of the water early when the threat of a UNK brought the season to an early close STOP
START the UNK association , meeting at UNK in september 1960 , devoted its session to a discussion of the boat problem STOP
START local industry's investment in rhode island was the big story in UNK industrial development effort STOP
START UNK companies started or committed themselves to new plant construction , UNK UNK square feet and representing an investment of UNK ; ; STOP
START a new UNK war 2 , record STOP
START with minor exceptions , this expansion was UNK either by firms based in rhode island or UNK manufacturers already operating here STOP
START what made these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960 was a year of UNK business UNK throughout the nation , rhode island UNK marked progress in new industry , new plants , and new jobs STOP
START of the major UNK in 1960 , three were financed under the UNK building UNK UNK UNK mortgage plan : UNK wire , UNK corporation , and american tube & controls STOP
START leading firms that arranged their own financing included UNK corporation , UNK , UNK , UNK of UNK , UNK gray iron UNK , UNK company , and UNK manufacturing company STOP
START expansion and UNK of industry in rhode island is the direct responsibility of the development UNK industrial division , and the figures quoted above indicate a successful year's operation STOP
START industrial division personnel worked with UNK UNK and UNK rhode island concerns during 1960 , many of whom are still interested in a rhode island location STOP
START they are conscious of this state's new feeling of UNK and assurance and are UNK impressed by the number of new plants and construction projects in rhode island STOP
START aids to small business STOP
START although much of the industrial UNK UNK effort is devoted to UNK new locations and UNK by major industries , small business is also UNK considerable attention STOP
START our office of foreign and domestic commerce UNK on a vigorous program , directly aimed at UNK and UNK the problems of manufacturers in the lower employment categories STOP
START a primary function is the operation of a government bid center , which receives UNK daily from the federal UNK principal purchasing agencies STOP
START assistance is rendered to interested rhode island UNK concerning interpretation of bid UNK , where to obtain UNK , and UNK concerning UNK STOP
START during the past year , UNK government bid UNK were received and UNK procurement leads were mailed to rhode island manufacturers STOP
START in addition , the UNK domestic trade program provided UNK services to those seeking information on establishment of new businesses ; ; STOP
START how and where to apply for financial assistance ; ; STOP
START details on marketing ; ; STOP
START information concerning patents , UNK and trade marks , availability of technical reports , and other subjects of interest to small business STOP
START the office of foreign and domestic commerce is also active in the field of international trade , UNK rhode island firms in developing and UNK markets abroad STOP
START this office UNK with the UNK of commerce in giving UNK coverage to services which include : statistics on markets abroad ; ; STOP
START locating foreign agents , UNK , UNK , UNK ; STOP
START information on foreign and domestic UNK duties and regulations , UNK , UNK , and establishing of branch representatives or plants abroad , and UNK requirements concerning UNK shipments and arrangements for payment STOP
START during the year 1960 , this office supplied UNK visitors with information related to foreign and domestic commerce , and made UNK field visits STOP
START advertising program STOP
START our UNK advertising continued , during 1960 , its previous effective program that stressed such UNK as UNK financing , plant UNK , and location advantages STOP
START we also continued to run a series of UNK UNK UNK of rhode island by UNK who had recently established new plants here STOP
START to reach a still greater audience of UNK manufacturers , our industrial advertising budget for the fiscal year was increased from UNK to UNK , and the industrial building UNK financial participation was UNK from UNK to UNK STOP
START newspaper advertising was mainly concentrated in the new york times and the wall street journal ( eastern and UNK UNK ) which averaged two prominent UNK per month , and to a lesser degree the new york UNK UNK and , for the west coast , the los angeles times and the wall street journal ( pacific coast edition ) STOP
START in addition to the regular schedule , UNK were run for maximum impact in special UNK of the new york times , boston UNK , american UNK , electronic news and , for local promotion , the providence sunday journal STOP
START magazine advertising included management methods , the new UNK , UNK , and plant location STOP
START the direct mail campaign consisted of 3 UNK UNK of UNK letters each and 6 UNK directed to electronics , plastics , UNK , and business machine manufacturers , and to UNK STOP
START these UNK UNK pieces of correspondence STOP
START the 1960 advertising campaign brought a total of UNK inquiries ; ; STOP
START UNK from UNK and 75 from direct mail STOP
START two hundred and nineteen were received from UNK of our 50 united states and 11 came from foreign countries STOP
START new york led in the number of inquiries , followed by california , new UNK , massachusetts , and pennsylvania STOP
START among foreign countries UNK were germany , canada , UNK and india STOP
START industrial promotion STOP
START an important operation in UNK industrial locations involves what we term `` missionary calls '' by one of this UNK industrial promotion specialists STOP
START these consist of visits , without previous UNK , on top officials of manufacturing concerns located in highly UNK areas STOP
START more than 25 carefully selected cities were visited , including new york , brooklyn , long island city , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , new UNK , UNK , boston , cambridge , UNK , and UNK STOP
START out of a total of UNK calls , UNK contacts were established with top executive personnel STOP
START we received UNK UNK visitors interested in UNK rhode UNK industrial advantages , and industrial division personnel made UNK UNK UNK visits STOP
START industrial conferences STOP
START during 1960 , two important conferences were organized by the development UNK industrial division STOP
START in june , the office of foreign and domestic commerce -- in conjunction with local trade associations , UNK of commerce , and bank officials -- sponsored a world trade conference at the UNK hotel STOP
START its purpose was to find ways of UNK the united UNK UNK balance of trade for 1958 and 1959 STOP
START approximately 100 representatives of business attended this UNK and the UNK conference committee later voted to continue the activity as an annual event STOP
START on october UNK of last year , the industrial division sponsored the UNK conference on industrial development at the former henry UNK school STOP
START a comprehensive program devoted to the various phases of the development effort attracted UNK interested individuals STOP
START morning sessions included addresses by UNK miller , UNK the UNK commerce STOP
START richard UNK , executive director of the new UNK state planning and development commission , and UNK UNK of general electric company STOP
START workshop sessions in the afternoon UNK development UNK from pennsylvania , connecticut and UNK , and UNK out a UNK program STOP
START in connection with this conference , a UNK supplement was published in the october UNK edition of the providence sunday journal STOP
START devoted to the improvement in business climate and increase in industrial construction in rhode island , it has proved a valuable UNK piece for this division STOP
START more than UNK copies have been sent out to prospective UNK STOP
START UNK and publications STOP
START other special UNK by the industrial division included copies of speeches delivered at the UNK conference , letters and UNK to UNK at UNK UNK at university of rhode island and letters and UNK of industrial UNK to such organizations as society of industrial realtors STOP
START UNK copies of the UNK of manufacturers were distributed : UNK UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START the industrial division published , in 1960 , a new , attractive industrial UNK , `` rhode island -- right for industry '' , and prepared copy for a new edition of the UNK of manufacturers ( to be printed shortly ) , and for a new space UNK STOP
START additional UNK activities included UNK the dedication program for operation UNK , the new UNK post office , and a conference with representatives of brown university , providence college , and university of rhode island , and eight electronics concerns regarding the UNK of a training program for electronics personnel STOP
START planning division STOP
START stated in its UNK terms , the main job of the planning division is to plan for the future of the state of rhode island STOP
START the activities of the planning division are defined in considerable detail in the UNK act of the development council , which UNK to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties in the field of planning STOP
START two years ago , the institute of public administration issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled `` UNK relations in metropolitan rhode island STOP
START as the result of an UNK review of the recommendations contained in this report , plus an analysis of our own UNK act , the planning division developed a number of basic planning objectives which caused a UNK of its work program STOP
START these objectives are stated here because of their importance in understanding the current activities of the planning division STOP
START ( 1 ) STOP
START first UNK will be given to the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background for all other planning activities in the state STOP
START ( 2 ) STOP
START UNK the truth of the statement by the institute of public administration that `` UNK planning ( in rhode island ) means , or should mean , state planning '' , the state guide plan will take into account the metropolitan nature of many of rhode UNK problems STOP
START ( 3 ) STOP
START it will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility of local government STOP
START to this end , the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function to make available , on a shared cost basis , technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their own planning staff STOP
START ( 4 ) STOP
START the planning division will take the initiative in encouraging planning cooperation at all levels of government ; ; STOP
START among the operating departments of the state ; ; STOP
START between the cities and towns of the state ; ; STOP
START and on a regional basis between the six new england states STOP
START ( 5 ) STOP
START on the basis that all citizens of the state are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources , plans for the provision of essential services ( such as water ) will be based on need regardless of arbitrary political UNK , within the UNK of the state plan STOP
START ( 6 ) STOP
START the state development budget will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the UNK of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan STOP
START ( 7 ) STOP
START in preparing the state guide plan , particular attention will be given means of UNK the economy of the state through the development of industry and recreation STOP
START UNK the planning division UNK out four activities : long-range state planning , current state planning , local planning assistance ; ; STOP
START and the preparation of the state development budget STOP
START long-range state planning STOP
START the planning division has UNK on the most complete and comprehensive state planning program in the nation STOP
START the long-range aspects of this program are divided into four distinct phases : basic UNK , inventory , analysis and plan and policy formation STOP
START the work program , as it was originally proposed , was to take five years to complete STOP
START recent events -- particularly the necessity of providing planning information for the UNK origin study of the department of public works -- indicate that this schedule will have to be UNK STOP
START the basic UNK phase of the program has been completed and the inventory phase is scheduled for completion july 1 , 1961 STOP
START basic UNK STOP
START since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning program , the first step taken by the planning division to UNK the long-range state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps -- one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile , and the second a series of 26 sheets at a scale of 1 inch to UNK feet , covering the entire state STOP
START with these maps completed , the inventory phase of the plan has been started STOP
START inventory STOP
START with the aid of matching federal funds available under section UNK of the housing act of 1954 as amended , the planning division began a one year program july 1 , 1960 to complete the inventory phase of the state planning program STOP
START this phase consists of four items : urban land use , rural land use , physical features and public utility service areas STOP
START since the validity of all subsequent planning depends on the accuracy of the basic inventory information , great care is being taken that the inventory is as complete as possible STOP
START the urban land use study carried out by the planning division staff has consisted of UNK and UNK all urban land uses which are of significance to UNK planning STOP
START the rural land use study is being carried out under contract by the university of rhode island and UNK all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use STOP
START the UNK of important physical features such as UNK and types of soil and the collection of all available information UNK to public utility service areas are being conducted as staff projects and , like the other two inventory projects , are scheduled for completion july 1 , 1961 STOP
START analysis STOP
START the collection of information is UNK unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose STOP
START special districts in rhode island STOP
START it is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in rhode island STOP
START however , a word should be mentioned in regard to them as independent units of government STOP
START there are UNK special district governments in rhode island ( excluding two regional school districts , four housing authorities , and the UNK county water authority ) STOP
START these UNK special purpose governments have the authority to UNK taxes , to UNK money , own property , UNK and be UNK , and in general to exercise normal corporate powers STOP
START unlike cities and towns , however , they do not have to UNK any financial statements to the state bureau of UNK STOP
START it is not an UNK to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government STOP
START in addition to the collection of service charges , the special districts UNK annual property taxes of approximately UNK STOP
START fiscal years in other states STOP
START comparative data STOP
START a review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report STOP
START included in the findings are : 1 STOP
START UNK states , including rhode island , end their fiscal year on june 30 STOP
START the other four states end on varying dates : alabama ( UNK ) , new york ( march 31 ) , pennsylvania ( may 31 ) , and texas ( august 31 ) STOP
START 2 STOP
START in sixteen states , the fiscal year ending of the cities ( june 30 ) is the same as that of the state : alaska , UNK , california , delaware , massachusetts , UNK , UNK , new mexico , north carolina , north UNK , UNK , UNK , vermont , west virginia , UNK , and hawaii ) STOP
START 3 STOP
START in eleven states , the fiscal year of the cities ends on december 31 , while the state fiscal year ends on june 30 ( arkansas , UNK , indiana , kansas , new UNK , new UNK , ohio , south UNK , UNK , washington , and wisconsin ) STOP
START 4 STOP
START in eight states whose fiscal years close on june 30 , a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on december 31 : : STOP
START ( georgia , UNK , UNK , UNK , maryland , UNK , virginia , and south carolina ) STOP
START 5 STOP
START one state , alabama , UNK its fiscal year on september 30 , and all cities in the state , with one exception , also close fiscal years on september 30 STOP
START 6 STOP
START mississippi UNK its fiscal year on june 30 , while all of its cities close their fiscal years on september 30 STOP
START 7 STOP
START pennsylvania UNK its fiscal year on may 31 STOP
START all of its cities close their fiscal years on december 31 STOP
START the remaining twelve states have varying fiscal years for the state , city and local governments STOP
START however , only illinois , UNK , louisiana and rhode island have a situation in which the UNK units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity STOP
START fiscal uniformity : advantages and UNK STOP
START advantages STOP
START an excellent summary of advantages concerning the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal UNK was contained in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently STOP
START he listed among the values of fiscal uniformity : 1 STOP
START the uniform fiscal year requires UNK with common sense administration of local UNK : UNK of the budget , or financial plan , in advance of spending STOP
START 2 STOP
START the uniform fiscal year UNK UNK with another common sense rule , that of having cash in the bank before UNK are drawn STOP
START it UNK towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash UNK STOP
START 3 STOP
START the uniform fiscal year UNK more careful UNK and UNK control over expenditures STOP
START by UNK the tax rate in advance of spending , upper limits are set on expenditures STOP
START 4 STOP
START the uniform fiscal year brings the UNK fiscal year into line with that of the schools , which UNK the largest share of local UNK STOP
START this greatly UNK the UNK UNK and financial reporting STOP
START 5 STOP
START the uniform fiscal year UNK interest charges on money UNK in the form of tax anticipation notes STOP
START furthermore , tax UNK not immediately needed for current expenditures may be UNK in short-term treasury notes , UNK the UNK UNK revenues and reducing the tax UNK STOP
START 6 STOP
START the uniform fiscal year UNK UNK comparison of revenues and expenditures STOP
START when towns have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful UNK ; ; STOP
START and as the cost of local government increases , the demand for such comparison also increases STOP
START towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare STOP
START of all advantages , probably none is more important than the UNK of tax anticipation notes STOP
START UNK in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority of UNK at all times STOP
START it may be by bank loans , sale of notes or UNK , or by the somewhat UNK method of UNK and registration of UNK STOP
START in any event it is a form of UNK which could be and should be rendered UNK STOP
START its UNK would result in the saving of interest costs , heavy when short-term money rates are high , and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most STOP
START this type of UNK can be reduced to a minimum if UNK UNK payment of taxes is UNK and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year STOP
START any approach toward such a system looks toward saving and security STOP
START it should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful UNK reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year STOP
START both the federal and state governments UNK their fiscal years on july 1 STOP
START both units of government contribute increasingly large sums of money to the several local governments in this state as indicated below : STOP
START it has been said that when local government revenues were mostly produced UNK from the property tax , the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great UNK ; ; STOP
START but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid , the emphasis on UNK , and the UNK sharing of responsibility for certain important functions , this is no longer true STOP
START the UNK fiscal year calendar is an UNK to the planning of clear and efficient UNK revenue and UNK relationships STOP
START UNK STOP
START although there are many sound reasons for UNK uniform and coordinated fiscal years in rhode island , there are also certain difficulties encountered STOP
START these involve more the mechanics employed in UNK to fiscal uniformity than they do actual UNK to the principle STOP
START one problem is a matter of UNK dates ; ; STOP
START the other , is how to finance the transition STOP
START little can be done about the changing of dates STOP
START this is an inherent part of UNK fiscal UNK STOP
START it usually means a confused and UNK UNK public for a period of time STOP
START but cooperation and understanding between local officials and the UNK help UNK this problem STOP
START the other problem is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities and towns STOP
START this will be covered more fully later STOP
START it should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can UNK to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city STOP
START fortunately , there are no cities or towns in the state , with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change STOP
START sacrifice will have to be made in some cases , but it is to the UNK advantage to finance the UNK for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation notes UNK STOP
START UNK the fiscal UNK STOP
START the advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well UNK fiscal and tax collection UNK are sufficiently great for rhode island UNK to UNK effort to secure them STOP
START the type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments needed STOP
START two features are immediately evident STOP
START first , the present situation is too varied to be UNK by any single formula STOP
START second , the shift to a uniform july 1 to june 30 fiscal year will , of itself , improve the tax collection UNK of the great majority of cities and towns STOP
START there are at least two problems to consider : one is a matter of UNK the fiscal calendar ; ; STOP
START the other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary STOP
START the latter matter is considered in detail in a later section STOP
START twelve cities and towns in rhode island presently indicate some plans to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax year calendar STOP
START plans vary from the `` talking stage '' to establishing special UNK to accomplish this end STOP
START what is important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them STOP
START an analysis of the fiscal tax collection year UNK throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought STOP
START however , it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual cities and towns involved STOP
START the adjustments needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout rhode island , based on a july 1 to june 30 year , are shown below STOP
START no adjustment needed STOP
START six cities and towns are presently on a july 1 to june 30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection year with it STOP
START no change is required for these towns STOP
START these UNK include : UNK , lincoln , UNK , newport , north UNK , and south UNK STOP
START adjustment of fiscal year STOP
START one town and one city , UNK and east providence , require an adjustment of their fiscal year only STOP
START this change will automatically adjust their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax UNK due and UNK in the fiscal year UNK within that year STOP
START adjustment of tax collection year STOP
START six cities and towns are now on a july 1 to june 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity STOP
START these cities and towns include UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , central falls , and UNK STOP
START UNK adjustments STOP
START two cities to be considered , providence and UNK , are an UNK STOP
START both have excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year UNK STOP
START however , neither of these two cities is on the desired july 1 to june 30 fiscal year STOP
START the adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easily for them STOP
START in that both cities end their fiscal years on september 30 , they could UNK taxes for an UNK period of nine months , UNK with september 30 and ending with june 30 STOP
START these three UNK dates would be : october 26 , january 26 , and april 25 ( providence ) and november 15 , february 16 and may 15 ( UNK ) STOP
START both would start their new fiscal year on july 1 STOP
START their tax collection calendar could then be : july 25 , october 26 , january 26 , and april 25 , ( providence ) ; ; STOP
START and august 15 , november 15 , february 17 , and may 15 , ( UNK ) STOP
START under this plan both UNK and providence would be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be using the same UNK periods STOP

START the remaining UNK towns have fiscal years which end prior to june 30 STOP
START all of these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years STOP
START assuming an adjustment to the july 1 to june 30 fiscal year , the required adjustment of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in table 3 STOP
START methods of financing adjustments STOP
START aside from the matter of UNK the fiscal and tax UNK , there is the problem of financing the adjustment when this is necessary STOP
START it should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or UNK of UNK UNK do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements STOP
START in many communities there is simply no financial problem ; ; STOP
START it is only a matter of UNK accounting methods , careful fiscal planning and management , or some like combination of techniques STOP
START in other UNK the difficulties in UNK the financial burden have been sufficiently great to UNK UNK of fiscal year changes STOP
START fortunately , such cases in rhode island are more the exception than the rule STOP
START as shown earlier in table 1 , the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection UNK STOP
START in addition , no two rhode island communities are identical in relation to their over-all financial condition STOP
START these factors practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible ; ; STOP
START each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax UNK , the financial condition of the UNK , and the length of the transition interval STOP
START suitable plans range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to UNK and require UNK ranging from short-term UNK notes to long-term bonds STOP
START the financial problem , where it exists , usually stems from the UNK of a budget for the UNK or adjustment period STOP
START for those communities which have financial difficulties in UNK adjustments , there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone , or in combination with others , would minimize if not even eliminate the problem STOP

START these publications replaced the UNK medical bulletin , published continuously from UNK through 1959 , as well as the UNK hospital corps UNK and the bulletin of the UNK medical department , published from UNK to 1949 STOP
START in addition , their establishment made it UNK to begin publication of a UNK air force medical bulletin STOP
START estimated annual savings resulting from publication of the journal and bulletin on a UNK basis , as compared with the cost of producing separate UNK for each service , were between UNK and UNK STOP
START UNK , on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations , the availability of the journal removed the necessity of UNK to several additional UNK of civilian origin over and above the quantity now authorized , in order to provide any reasonably comparable coverage STOP
START from 1 july 1958 to 30 june 1960 , 24 numbers of the journal and nine of the bulletin were published STOP
START each journal contained articles of professional and clinical interest , and departments devoted to military medical news , UNK of new books , and other features of interest to officers of the medical services STOP
START the council on national defense of the american medical association contributed a brief article to each issue entitled , `` this is your UNK STOP
START beginning with the october 1959 issue of the journal , the method of production of copy for UNK UNK was changed from UNK to hot UNK STOP
START this resulted in an improved appearance , but was followed by an increase in printing cost that UNK the institution of major UNK to keep within the total of UNK funds STOP
START the use of 100 instead of UNK substance paper plus the UNK of side UNK beginning with the may 1960 issue reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal year with nearly UNK in UNK funds STOP

START in may 1960 , the armed forces institute of pathology began a series of articles on the `` medical museum '' , and in june , the institute started contributing a regular monthly `` case for UNK '' STOP
START the institute also planned to furnish a regular series of articles , beginning in the fall of 1960 , on its more significant scientific exhibits STOP
START the armed forces UNK board agreed to UNK each month a report for one of its 12 UNK , so that each commission will report once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest and value to medical officers of the armed forces STOP
START the first report in this continuing series appeared in the september 1960 issue of the journal STOP
START another recent achievement was the successful development of a method for the complete combustion in a UNK UNK of a metal in UNK when the product is relatively UNK STOP
START this work gave a heat of formation of aluminum UNK which closely UNK a value which had been determined by a less direct method , and raises this property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago STOP
START similar measurements are being initiated to UNK a large UNK in the heat of formation of another important combustion product , UNK UNK STOP
START the development and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is UNK completion STOP
START in one of these , an UNK device to study systems UNK up to UNK af and 100 UNK pressure , a major goal was achieved STOP
START the accuracy of measuring the total electrical energy entering an UNK wire during a few UNK was UNK when two independent types of comparison with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than 2 percent STOP
START this agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals STOP
START the method of UNK UNK a fixed resistance element as a UNK STOP
START the element is inserted in the discharge circuit in place of the UNK wire , and the UNK heating of the element is measured with high accuracy STOP
START this is used as a reference for UNK the UNK heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element STOP
START a UNK UNK has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire UNK STOP
START the UNK consists of two parts : a UNK part and a UNK part STOP
START using UNK method , the UNK action is obtained from the UNK of a window by UNK a series of parallel lead UNK STOP
START the UNK of the UNK consists of a piece of aluminum foil ( approximately af ) placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera STOP
START the opening action is obtained when a UNK , charged to high voltage , is suddenly UNK through the foil STOP
START during the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll UNK toward its center line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera STOP
START experiments have shown that the UNK is 75 percent open in about UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and UNK the electrical energy input to the foil STOP
START laboratory measurements of UNK radio spectra STOP
START besides the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm UNK , the spectra of UNK radio sources may contain sharp lines characteristic of other atoms , UNK , and small UNK STOP
START the detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on UNK gas clouds and , perhaps , planetary UNK STOP
START among the most likely producers of UNK radio line spectra are the light UNK UNK oh and UNK ; ; STOP
START somewhat less likely sources are the UNK UNK UNK , UNK , and aj STOP
START very small UNK of these UNK should be UNK ; ; STOP
START in UNK gas , UNK as low as af UNK per af may be sufficient , as compared to the af hydrogen UNK af required for detection of the UNK line STOP
START high sensitivity in radio UNK is achieved by reducing the UNK of the UNK ; ; STOP
START therefore , only with precise UNK of the line frequencies is an UNK search for the radio spectra of these UNK feasible STOP
START to secure precise measurements of these frequencies , a research program in free radical UNK UNK has been started STOP
START since conventional methods are UNK at the low frequencies of these molecular UNK , the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead STOP
START this involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor , which shifts the UNK spectra to a UNK high UNK range , where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity STOP
START the first UNK UNK investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the oh radical STOP
START results of this experiment include the frequencies of the two strong UNK lines by which oh may be identified in UNK gas ; ; STOP
START the frequencies are UNK and UNK af , with an uncertainty of UNK af STOP
START success in UNK these UNK lines has so far , apparently , been confined to the laboratory ; ; STOP

START UNK UNK STOP
START an UNK UNK has been constructed and used , with helium gas as the UNK fluid , to measure temperatures near UNK and UNK af STOP
START such an UNK provides a means of absolute temperature measurement , and may be used as an alternative to the gas UNK STOP
START when values of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid UNK vapor pressures , differences of about 10 and 7 UNK respectively were found STOP
START this result is preliminary , and work is continuing STOP

START the UNK of helium UNK UNK have been investigated in conjunction with a `` constant temperature '' liquid helium UNK from UNK to UNK af STOP
START surface temperature UNK have been found to exist in liquid helium UNK contained in UNK and UNK UNK storage UNK STOP
START the gradient was about one half of a UNK at UNK af but increased to several UNK for UNK temperatures slightly greater than the UNK point STOP
START a UNK head UNK has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures or temperatures for the UNK liquid helium STOP
START however , the surface temperature gradient can produce UNK UNK measurements for the UNK liquid helium unless UNK are taken to UNK the tube ( which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure UNK ) from the liquid helium surface STOP
START it has also been observed , in helium 2 , that large UNK can exist between surface vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure UNK STOP
START this has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure UNK STOP
START in this case also the design of the UNK can be modified to reduce the helium film flow STOP
START pressure UNK for UNK measurements STOP
START precise UNK measurements on UNK UNK are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure UNK STOP

START over a temperature range from 25 to 200 af and at pressures up to UNK UNK , an UNK of 300 UNK , applied for a period of one day , results in an uncertainty in the pressure of , at most , one UNK of UNK STOP
START transport properties of air STOP

START this project was carried out under UNK of the ballistic missile division of the air research and development command , UNK force , and had as its goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat energy of chemical binding STOP
START a significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of UNK numbers reaching values of more than unity in the UNK UNK region STOP
START another effect discovered is the large UNK of thermal diffusion UNK to separate UNK from the oxygen when temperature differences UNK the UNK UNK region are present STOP

START it is the strategy of blockade , therefore , that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials , members of congress , officers in the UNK STOP
START as a possible course of action , it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions STOP
START among these questions : what would a cuba blockade take ? ? STOP
START military experts say a UNK naval blockade off UNK UNK and at the approaches to UNK waters would require two naval task forces , each built around an aircraft UNK with a complement of about 100 planes and several UNK STOP

START in a broad sense , it would UNK the UNK doctrine by opposing communist interference in the western UNK STOP
START it could , by UNK direct intervention , provide a UNK strategy to meet UNK UNK STOP
START primary target would be shipments of tanks , guns , UNK UNK and UNK coming from russia and UNK STOP

START despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million UNK persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope with the nation's UNK of an estimated two million UNK STOP
START to assist the states , therefore , in UNK UNK individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and UNK in UNK employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the UNK congress enacted the vocational rehabilitation UNK of 1954 ( UNK ) STOP
START these UNK to the vocational rehabilitation act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more UNK and `` UNK '' UNK , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the UNK and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the UNK UNK effectiveness STOP
START financial aspects STOP
START under the law as it existed until 1943 , the federal government made UNK to the states on the basis of population , matching state expenditures on a UNK basis STOP
START under UNK , UNK congress , the federal government assumed responsibility for UNK of necessary state expenditures in connection with administration and the UNK and placement of the UNK , and for 50% of the necessary costs of providing UNK with rehabilitation case services STOP
START throughout these years , the statutory UNK was for such sums as were necessary to carry out the provisions of the act STOP

START in order to assist the states in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services , section 2 of the amended act provides that UNK to states for support of such services be based on ( 1 ) need , as measured by a state's population , and ( 2 ) fiscal capacity , as measured by its per capita income STOP
START the act further provides for a `` floor '' or minimum allotment , set at the 1954 level , which is called the `` base '' allotment , and a `` ceiling '' or maximum allotment , for each state STOP
START it UNK , in addition , that all amounts remaining as a result of UNK the `` ceiling '' , and not used for UNK the `` floor '' , be UNK to those states still below their UNK STOP
START these provisions are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the states , with the objective that a UNK UNK person have access to needed services regardless of whether he UNK in a state with a low or high per capita income or a UNK or UNK UNK state STOP
START the provisions are also designed to avoid UNK in state programs already in operation , which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population alone STOP

START funds UNK in addition to their minimum allotment are UNK to the two agencies as they may determine STOP
START matching requirements STOP
START explanation of matching formula STOP
START as is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services , the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula STOP
START prior to 1960 , in order to provide matching for the minimum ( base ) allotment , state funds had to equal 1954 state funds STOP
START prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is UNK at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the state , with a UNK of UNK state ( or UNK federal ) participation in total program costs STOP
START the percentage of federal participation in such costs for any state is referred to in the law as that state's `` federal share '' STOP
START for purposes of this explanation , this percentage is referred to as the state's `` unadjusted federal share '' STOP
START beginning in 1960 , the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted ( upward or downward , as required ) UNK a year , so that by UNK the entire support allotment will be UNK on the basis of a UNK UNK state share , with maximum and minimum state shares of 50% and UNK , respectively STOP
START the UNK rate of federal participation with respect to any state's base allotment , as well as the adjusted rate in effect during the 1960 - 1962 period , is designated by the statute as that state's `` adjusted federal share '' STOP
START the provisions for determining a state's unadjusted federal share are designed to reflect the varying financial resources among the states STOP
START the purpose of the adjusted federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition provisions for reaching the unadjusted federal share is to prevent UNK from abrupt changes in matching rates STOP
START method of computing federal shares STOP
START the method used for computing the respective federal and state shares in total program costs is specifically set forth in the act STOP
START the term `` state '' means the several states , the district of columbia , the virgin islands , UNK and puerto rico ; ; STOP

START ) building plans are on page 21 STOP
START solid concrete blocks , relatively heavy and UNK , are used for this shelter STOP
START these blocks are sold in various UNK so it seldom is necessary to cut a block to fit STOP
START solid blocks are recommended because UNK blocks would have to be filled with concrete to give effective protection STOP
START UNK are an alternative STOP
START if they are used , the walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give the same protection as the UNK solid concrete blocks STOP

START ( see UNK , UNK shelter STOP
START ) most people would have to UNK a UNK to build this shelter STOP
START plans are on pages 22 and 23 STOP
START this shelter could be built in regions where water or rock is close to the surface , making it UNK to build an underground shelter STOP
START two walls of concrete blocks are constructed at least 20 inches apart STOP
START the space between them is filled with UNK UNK or earth STOP
START the walls are held together with metal ties placed in the wet UNK as the walls are built STOP
START the roof shown here ( UNK ) is a UNK UNK of UNK concrete , covered with at least 20 inches of UNK UNK STOP
START an UNK roof , perhaps more within UNK reach , could be constructed of heavy wooden roof beams , UNK with boards and UNK STOP
START it would have to be covered with at least UNK inches of UNK UNK STOP
START the materials for a UNK shelter would cost about UNK STOP
START UNK charges would be additional STOP
START the shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection STOP
START UNK metal shelter STOP
START UNK UNK metal sections or UNK concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground STOP
START these are particularly suitable for regions where water or rock is close to the surface STOP
START they form effective fallout shelters when UNK over with earth , as shown in figure 10 STOP
START materials for this shelter would cost about UNK STOP
START a UNK probably would be required to help build it STOP
START his charges would be added to the cost of materials STOP
START this shelter , as shown on page 24 , would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation STOP
START an UNK UNK entrance , shown on page 25 , would reduce the cost of materials UNK to UNK STOP
START the national lumber manufacturers association , washington , UNK is developing plans to UNK UNK treated lumber for underground shelter construction STOP
START the structural clay products institute , washington , UNK is working to develop UNK and clay products suitable for shelter construction STOP
START underground concrete shelter STOP
START an underground UNK concrete shelter can be built by a UNK for about UNK to UNK , depending on the type of entrance STOP
START the shelter shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection STOP
START the illustration ( UNK ) shows this shelter with the roof at ground level and UNK over STOP
START the same shelter could be built into an UNK or below ground level STOP
START plans for the shelter , with either a UNK or UNK entrance , are shown on pages 26 and 27 STOP
START another type of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction STOP
START it would add about UNK to the total cost of the home STOP
START the shelter illustrated in figure 12 is based on such a room built in a new home in the washington , UNK in the spring of 1959 STOP
START important considerations common to each type of shelter are : 1 STOP
START arrangement of the entrance STOP
START 2 STOP
START UNK STOP
START 3 STOP
START radio reception STOP
START 4 STOP
START lighting STOP
START the entrance must have at least one UNK turn STOP
START radiation UNK somewhat like light STOP
START some will go around a corner STOP
START the rest continues in a straight line STOP
START therefore , sharp turns in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter STOP
START UNK is provided in a concrete block basement shelter by UNK in the wall and by the open entrance STOP
START a UNK may be installed to increase comfort STOP
START a UNK is essential for the UNK shelter and for the underground shelters STOP
START it should provide not less than 5 cubic feet per minute of air per person STOP
START UNK UNK also are necessary ( as shown in UNK , 10 , and 11 ) , but UNK are not STOP
START radio reception is cut down by the UNK necessary to keep out radiation STOP
START as soon as the shelter is completed a radio reception check must be made STOP
START it probably will be necessary to UNK an outside antenna , particularly to receive UNK UNK STOP
START lighting is an important consideration STOP
START continuous UNK lighting may be provided in the shelter by means of a UNK UNK battery to which is UNK a UNK UNK UNK STOP
START tests have shown that such a device , with a fresh battery , will furnish light continuously for at least 10 days STOP
START with a spare battery , a source of light for 2 weeks or more would be assured STOP
START a UNK or electric UNK also should be available for those periods when a UNK light is needed STOP
START there should be a regular electrical UNK in the shelter as power may continue in many areas STOP
START other considerations STOP
START -- if there are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter , they should be UNK as shown in the UNK , page 29 STOP
START other basement windows should be UNK when an emergency UNK STOP
START basement walls that project above the ground should be UNK as shown in the UNK , page 29 STOP
START in these shelters the entrance should be not more than 2 feet wide STOP
START bunks , or materials to build them , may have to be put inside the UNK before the shelter walls are completed STOP
START the basement or UNK shelters also will serve for UNK or UNK protection STOP
START 3 STOP
START living in a shelter STOP
START the UNK of fallout UNK rapidly at first STOP
START UNK hours after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about 1 percent of what it was an hour after the UNK STOP
START but the radiation may be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous STOP
START therefore , civil defense instructions received over UNK or by other means should be followed STOP
START a UNK radio is essential STOP
START radiation instruments suitable for home use are available , and would be of value in locating that portion of the home which offers the best protection against fallout radiation STOP
START there is a possibility that UNK UNK with UNK radiation meters may become available STOP
START one instrument thus would serve both purposes STOP
START your local civil defense will UNK its own information and will receive broad information from state and federal sources STOP
START it will tell you as soon as possible : STOP
START how long to stay in your shelter ; ; STOP
START how soon you may go UNK ; ; STOP
START how long you may stay outside STOP
START you should be prepared to stay in your shelter full time for at least several days and to make it your home for 14 days or longer STOP
START a UNK in the UNK ( ( page 30 ) tells what is needed STOP
START families with children will have particular problems STOP
START they should provide for simple recreation STOP
START there should be a task for everyone and these tasks should be UNK STOP
START part of the family should be sleeping while the rest is UNK STOP
START to break the UNK it may be necessary to UNK tasks that will keep the family busy STOP
START records such as UNK can be kept STOP
START the survival of the family will depend largely on information received by radio STOP
START a record should be kept of the information and instructions , including the time and date of UNK STOP
START family UNK probably will be necessary STOP
START UNK should be operated UNK on a regular schedule STOP
START there will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has UNK enough to allow use of the whole basement STOP
START however , as much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum STOP
START the UNK problems of living in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied STOP
START food , medical supplies , UNK , and equipment , if not already stored in the shelter , must be quickly gathered up and carried into it STOP
START after the family has settled in the shelter , the UNK rules should be UNK out by the adult in charge STOP
START UNK in the UNK of the family shelter will require much thought and planning STOP

START the first UNK conference -- held to UNK UNK UNK to represent the interest of the stockholders of du pont and general motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent UNK -- took place on september 25 , 1957 STOP
START at the UNK , the UNK UNK explained that counsel for the government and for du pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court STOP
START du pont , he said , had proposed UNK of its general motors stock along with other restrictions on the du pont - general motors relationship STOP
START the government , UNK these suggestions inadequate , had urged that any judgment include UNK of du pont's shares of general motors STOP
START counsel for the government invited du pont's views on this proposal before UNK a specific program , but stated that if the court desired , or if counsel for du pont thought further discussion would not be profitable , the government was prepared to UNK a plan within thirty days STOP
START counsel for du pont indicated a UNK for the UNK of detailed plans by both sides at an early date STOP
START no previous UNK case , he said , had involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems of relief STOP
START the UNK of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of UNK or UNK in the abstract STOP
START the court adopted this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out STOP
START the government submitted its proposed UNK on october 25 , 1957 STOP
START the plan called for UNK by du pont of its UNK shares of general motors stock by equal annual UNK to its stockholders , as a UNK , over a period of ten years STOP
START UNK UNK company and delaware UNK & investment company , major stockholders in du pont , and the stockholders of delaware were dealt with UNK by provisions requiring the annual sale by a UNK , again over a UNK period , of du pont's general motors stock UNK to them , as well as any general motors stock which UNK and delaware owned UNK STOP
START if , in the UNK judgment , `` reasonable market conditions '' did not UNK during any given year , he was to be allowed to UNK the court for an extension of time within the UNK period STOP
START in addition , the right to vote the general motors stock held by du pont was to be UNK in du pont's stockholders , other than UNK and delaware and the stockholders of delaware ; ; STOP
START du pont , UNK , and delaware were to be UNK from UNK stock in or UNK control over general motors ; ; STOP
START du pont , UNK , and delaware were to be UNK to have any director or officer in common with general motors , and vice UNK ; ; STOP
START and general motors and du pont were to be ordered to UNK any agreement that provided for the purchase by general motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any du pont UNK product , or for the grant of exclusive patent rights , or for a grant by general motors to du pont of a UNK right to make or sell any chemical discovery of general motors , or for the maintenance of any joint commercial enterprise by the two companies STOP
START on motion of the UNK UNK , the court directed that a ruling be obtained from the UNK of internal revenue as to the federal income tax consequences of the UNK plan STOP
START on may 9 , 1958 , the UNK announced his UNK STOP
START the annual UNK paid to du pont stockholders in shares of general motors stock would be UNK as ordinary income to the extent of du pont's UNK and profits STOP
START the measure , for federal income tax purposes , of the UNK to individual stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time of each annual distribution STOP
START in the case of UNK corporate stockholders , the measure would be the lesser of the fair market value of the shares or du pont's tax basis for them , which is approximately UNK per share STOP
START the forced sale of the general motors stock owned by or UNK to UNK , delaware , and the stockholders of delaware , and UNK with the UNK , would result in a tax to those parties at the capital UNK rate STOP
START du pont's UNK was filed on may 14 , 1958 STOP
START under its plan du pont would UNK its general motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders the right to vote those shares STOP
START UNK and delaware would , in turn , be required to pass on the voting rights to the general motors shares UNK to them to their own stockholders STOP
START du pont would be UNK from having as a director , officer , or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of general motors , and no director , officer , or employee of du pont could serve as a director of general motors without court approval STOP
START du pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional general motors stock except through general UNK UNK of stock or UNK rights to its stockholders STOP
START on june 6 , 1958 , general motors submitted its UNK to the UNK proposal STOP
START it argued , UNK UNK , that a UNK order would severely UNK the market value of the stock of both general motors and du pont , with UNK serious loss and UNK to hundreds of thousands of innocent UNK , among them thousands of small UNK and UNK institutions ; ; STOP
START that there would be a similar decline in the market values of other UNK and chemical UNK , with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies ; ; STOP
START that the tremendous volume of general motors stock UNK over the market for ten years would UNK the efforts of general motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise UNK capital ; ; STOP
START and that all this would have a serious UNK effect on the entire stock market and on general business activity STOP
START general motors UNK contended that the government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as required by the UNK of this court STOP
START the UNK proposed by the UNK UNK were filed in august of 1958 STOP
START these plans , like du pont's , contained provisions for passing the vote on du pont's general motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of du pont , UNK , and delaware , except that officers and directors of the three companies , their UNK , and other people living in their UNK , as well as other specified persons , were to be UNK UNK STOP
START both plans also UNK common directors , officers , or employees between du pont , UNK , and delaware , on the one hand , and general motors on the other STOP
START it is not a medieval mental UNK or an attitude `` UNK by sense '' to believe that UNK and wives should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to UNK the UNK of the marriage relationship STOP
START while it is easy enough to UNK UNK UNK in UNK of the crown from a metaphysical point of view , the concept of the `` UNK '' of a married couple may reflect an UNK belief that the UNK between husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage STOP
START by making UNK in the name of law enforcement into the protection which congress has UNK to the marriage relationship , the court today continues in the path UNK by the recent decision in UNK UNK states , UNK UNK , where the court held that , under the circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to UNK against her husband over her objection STOP
START one need not UNK in his belief in UNK law enforcement to insist that there are other things in american life which are also of great importance , and to which even law enforcement must UNK itself STOP
START one of these is the UNK and the UNK relationship of marriage STOP
START the UNK opinion UNK UNK that the UNK UNK doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` UNK an UNK into a rule of law '' STOP

START petitioner registered with local board UNK , UNK , UNK , on march 17 , 1952 STOP
START his answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a minister of UNK UNK , employed at night by a sugar UNK STOP
START he claimed UNK classification as a minister of religion , UNK a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching STOP
START on november 13 , 1952 , he was classified in class UNK STOP
START on november 22 , 1952 , he wrote the board , UNK this classification STOP
START he again stated that he was `` a regular minister '' ; ; STOP
START that he was `` UNK an average of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly '' , in addition to 50 to 75 hours in other UNK duties , and that he opposed war in any form STOP
START thereafter he was classified UNK STOP
START on april 1 , 1953 , after some six months of full-time `` UNK '' , petitioner UNK UNK 100 hours a month to preaching , but failed to so UNK his local board STOP
START in a UNK review , the local board on july 30 , 1953 , UNK him UNK and UNK this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner , because of his UNK to kill in defense of his church and home STOP
START upon administrative approval of the UNK , he was ordered to report for UNK on june 11 , 1956 , but failed to do so STOP
START he was not UNK , however , and his case was UNK UNK , in the light of UNK UNK states , UNK UNK ( 1955 ) STOP
START he was again UNK UNK by the local board STOP
START there followed a UNK department of justice hearing , at which petitioner appeared STOP
START in his report to the attorney general , the hearing officer suggested that the petitioner be UNK only from UNK training and service STOP
START on march 21 , 1957 , however , the department recommended approval of the UNK classification STOP
START its ground for this recommendation was that , while petitioner claimed before the local board august 17 , 1956 ( as evidenced by its UNK in his file of that date ) , that he was UNK 100 hours per month to actual preaching , the headquarters of the UNK UNK reported that he was no longer doing so and , on the contrary , had UNK both his pioneer and bible student servant positions STOP
START it reported that he now devoted only some UNK hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per month to church activities STOP
START his claim was therefore `` so highly UNK '' , the department concluded , that it `` cast doubt upon his UNK and , consequently , upon his UNK and good faith '' STOP
START the appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation STOP
START in his answer thereto , he advised the board that he had made no such statement in 1956 , and asserted that his only claim to `` UNK '' was in 1952 STOP
START the appeal board , however , UNK UNK in the department's recommendation STOP
START upon return of the file to the local board , petitioner was again ordered to report for UNK and this UNK followed his failure to do so STOP
START petitioner first UNK that the department denied him UNK due process by not giving him UNK opportunity , before its final recommendation to the appeal board , to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of UNK 100 hours to actual preaching STOP
START but the statement of the local board UNK this claim to petitioner was in his file STOP
START he admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times , and he could have UNK it before the hearing officer STOP
START this he failed to do , UNK that he did not know it to be in his file STOP
START apparently he never took the trouble to find out STOP
START nevertheless he had ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board STOP
START after the recommendation of the department is UNK to the appeal board , that is the appropriate place for a UNK to UNK his denial STOP
START this he did STOP
START we found in UNK UNK states , UNK , that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a UNK STOP
START we said there that it was necessary `` that a UNK be given an opportunity to UNK ( the department's ) recommendation when it comes to the appeal board , the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification '' STOP
START UNK UNK at UNK STOP
START we fail to see how such procedure resulted in any UNK to UNK UNK , which was considered by the appeal board and denied by it STOP
START as was said in UNK , `` it is the appeal board which UNK the selective service determination considered ' final ' in the courts , not to be UNK unless there is no basis in fact STOP
START UNK UNK states , UNK UNK '' STOP
START UNK UNK at UNK STOP
START but there are other UNK which might be considered more difficult STOP
START at his trial , petitioner sought to secure through UNK UNK UNK the UNK notes of the department's hearing officer , UNK , as well as his report UNK STOP
START petitioner also claimed at trial the right to UNK the original federal bureau of investigation reports to the department of justice STOP
START he UNK no specific UNK errors or evidence UNK ; ; STOP
START nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the federal bureau of investigation reports might UNK STOP
START section UNK of the act , as we have held , does require the department's recommendation to be placed in a UNK file STOP
START UNK UNK states , UNK STOP
START but there is nothing in the act requiring the hearing officer's report to be likewise turned over to the UNK STOP
START while the regulations formerly required that the hearing officer's report be placed in the UNK file , this requirement was eliminated in 1952 STOP
START moreover , the hearing officer's report is but UNK , is directed to the attorney general and , of course , is not the recommendation of the department STOP
START it is not essentially different from a UNK of an attorney in the department of justice , of which the attorney general receives many , and to which he may give his approval or UNK STOP
START it is but part of the whole process within the department that goes into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board STOP
START it is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing officer's notes were furnished to the appeal board STOP
START hence the petitioner had full opportunity to UNK the only conclusions of the department on file with the board STOP
START petitioner knew that the department's recommendation was based not on the hearing officer's report but on the statement of the local board in his file STOP
START having had every opportunity to UNK the finding of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not UNK STOP
START it appears to us that the same UNK applies to the production of the hearing officer's report and notes at the trial STOP
START in addition , petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes STOP
START while there are now UNK of the UNK of `` favorable evidence developed at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process STOP
START moreover , his testimony at trial never developed any such facts STOP
START in the light of these circumstances , as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the department's recommendation , which petitioner UNK but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record , we find no UNK in the hearing officer's report and notes STOP
START finally petitioner says that he was entitled to UNK the UNK report during the proceedings before the hearing officer as well as at the trial STOP
START he did receive a UNK of it -- the same that was furnished the appeal board -- and he made no claim of its UNK STOP
START even now no such claim is asserted STOP
START he bases his present UNK on the general right to UNK , UNK that he hopes to find some UNK in the UNK STOP
START but this is fully answered by united states UNK , UNK STOP
START there we held `` that the statutory scheme for review , within the selective service system , UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK to no UNK that the UNK reports must be produced for their inspection '' STOP
START UNK UNK at UNK STOP
START even if we were not bound by UNK , petitioner here would not be entitled to the report STOP
START the recommendation of the department -- as well as the decision of the appeal board -- was based entirely on the local board file , not on an UNK report STOP
START foreign policy in its total context STOP
START with this UNK role in mind , i should like to make a few suggestions : what we in the united states do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world STOP
START we in this department must think about foreign policy in its total context STOP
START we cannot regard foreign policy as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal policy has been UNK STOP
START foreign policy is the total involvement of the american people with peoples and governments abroad STOP
START that means that , if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership , we must think in terms of the total context of our situation STOP
START it is the concern of the department of state that the american people are safe and secure -- defense is not a UNK concern of the department of defense STOP
START it is also the concern of the department of state that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous , profitable , and active -- this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the department of commerce STOP
START we can no longer UNK on UNK machinery `` UNK UNK '' to UNK differences between this and other departments STOP
START assistant UNK of state will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination of policies STOP
START means must be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as UNK as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign policy STOP
START i think we need to concern ourselves also with the UNK of action STOP
START every policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer STOP
START unless we keep our eyes on the horizon ahead , we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present STOP
START the movement of events is so fast , the pace so severe , that an attempt to UNK into the future is essential if we are to think accurately about the present STOP
START if there is anything which we can do in the executive branch of the government to speed up the processes by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act promptly , that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs STOP
START action taken today is often far more valuable than action taken several months later in response to a situation then out of control STOP
START there will of course be times for delay and UNK STOP
START what i am UNK is that when we delay , or when we fail to act , we do so UNK and not through UNK or through UNK or UNK difficulties STOP
START i also hope that we can do something about reducing the UNK UNK rate of ideas -- an UNK of all UNK STOP
START we want to UNK ideas from the bottom to the top of the department STOP
START we want to make sure that our junior colleagues realize that ideas are welcome , that initiative goes right down to the bottom and goes all the way to the top STOP
START i hope no one UNK that only presidential UNK are looked upon as sources of ideas STOP
START the responsibility for taking the initiative in UNK ideas is that of every officer in the department who has a policy function , regardless of rank STOP
START further , i would hope that we could pay attention to little things STOP
START while UNK the operations of our government in various parts of the world , i have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which UNK our main effort STOP
START to UNK only a few examples : the wrong man in the wrong position , perhaps even in a junior position abroad , can be a source of great UNK to our policy ; ; STOP
START the attitudes of a UNK who experiences difficulty in finding adequate housing in new york city , or of a foreign UNK in similar circumstances in our capital , can easily be directed against the united states and all that it stands for STOP
START UNK of seemingly small matters go wrong all over the world STOP
START sometimes those who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them STOP
START i would hope that we could create the recognition in the department and overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them STOP
START if the department of state is to take primary responsibility for foreign policy in washington , it follows that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas STOP
START this does not mean in a purely UNK sense but in an active , operational , interested , responsible fashion STOP
START he is expected to know about what is going on among the representatives of other agencies who are UNK in his country STOP
START he is expected to UNK , to encourage , to direct , to assist in any way he can STOP
START if any official operation abroad begins to go wrong , we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and to get suggestions for UNK action STOP
START the problems of a policy officer STOP
START it occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts which i expressed UNK in recent years , in the hope of UNK up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy is all about and what it means , and of developing a certain UNK for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside government STOP
START i tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior UNK policy officer faces STOP
START this means practically everybody in this room STOP
START whether it will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine STOP
START the senior policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of UNK : an idea in his own head , the suggestions of a UNK , a question from the secretary or the president , a proposal by another department , a communication from a foreign government or an american ambassador abroad , the filing of an item for the UNK of the united nations or of any other of UNK of international bodies , a news item read at the breakfast table , a question to the president or the secretary at a news conference , a speech by a senator or congressman , an article in a UNK , a resolution from a national organization , a request for assistance from some private american interests abroad , et UNK , UNK UNK STOP
START the policy officer lives with his UNK UNK for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility STOP
START his first thought is about the question itself : is there a question here for american foreign policy , and , if so , what is it ? ? STOP
START for he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job is to know what the question is -- that when it is accurately identified it sometimes answers itself , and that the way in which it is UNK frequently shapes the answer STOP
START UNK it over with his colleagues and in his own mind , he reaches a UNK identification of the question -- UNK because it may change as he UNK it further and because , if no UNK answer can be found , it may have to be changed into one which can be answered STOP
START meanwhile he has been thinking about the facts surrounding the problem , facts which he knows can never be complete , and the general background , much of which has already been lost to history STOP
START he is UNK of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play , taking care to examine at least some of the raw material which UNK their frequently UNK conclusions STOP
START he knows that he must give the expert his place , but he knows that he must also keep him in it STOP
START he is already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action , including doing nothing STOP
START he knows that he is thinking about action in relation to a future which can be UNK but UNK through a UNK UNK STOP
START but he takes his UNK from the great UNK of policy , UNK UNK , the commitments of the united states under international UNK and UNK , basic UNK , and UNK notions of the american people about how we are to conduct ourselves , in policy literature such as country papers and national security council papers UNK in the department STOP
START he will not be UNK to find that general principles produce UNK results in the UNK situation with which he is confronted STOP
START he must think about which of these principles must take UNK STOP
START he will know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance STOP
START he is aware that every UNK important problem UNK UNK into every other problem STOP
START he must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole -- when the whole is too large to UNK STOP
START he must think of others who have a UNK in the question and in its answer STOP
START who should be UNK among his colleagues in the department or other departments and agencies of the government ? ? STOP
START which american UNK could provide helpful advice ? ? STOP
START are private interests sufficiently involved to be UNK ? ? STOP
START what is the probable attitude of other governments , including those less directly involved ? ? STOP
START how and at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be UNK ? ? STOP
START if action is indicated , what kind of action is relevant to the problem ? ? STOP
START the selection of the wrong tools can mean waste , at best , and at worst an UNK UNK of the problem itself STOP
START can the president or the secretary act under existing authority , or will new legislation and new money be required ? ? STOP
START should the action be UNK or UNK ? ? STOP
START is the matter one for the united nations or some other international body ? ? STOP
START for , if so , the path leads through a complex process of UNK UNK which UNK still another UNK to the problem STOP
START respect for the opinions of mankind STOP
START what type of action can hope to win public support , first in this country and then abroad ? ? STOP
START for the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to UNK it STOP
START he is interested in public opinion for two reasons : first , because it is important in itself , and , second , because he knows that the american public UNK about a UNK respect for the opinions of mankind STOP
START and , given probable public attitudes -- about which reasonably good estimates can be made -- what action is called for to insure necessary support ? ? STOP
START may i add a caution on this particular point ? ? STOP
START we do not want policy officers below the level of presidential UNK to concern themselves too much with problems of domestic politics in UNK foreign policy action STOP
START in the first place our business is foreign policy , and it is the business of the presidential leadership and his UNK in the department to consider the domestic political aspects of a problem STOP
START UNK emphasized this point by saying , `` you fellows in the department of state don't know much about domestic politics '' STOP
START this is an important consideration STOP
START if we sit here reading UNK and looking at UNK UNK and other reports that cross our UNK , we should realize that this is raw , UNK opinion expressed in the absence of leadership STOP
START what the american people will do turns in large degree on their leadership STOP
START we cannot test public opinion until the president and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action STOP
START i doubt , for example , that , 3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the marshall plan , any UNK expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals STOP
START the problem in the policy officer's mind thus begins to take shape as a UNK of utterly complicated factors -- political , military , economic , financial , legal , legislative , UNK , administrative -- to be UNK out and handled within a political system which moves by consent in relation to an external environment which cannot be under control STOP
START and the policy officer has the UNK of time UNK at his UNK STOP
START while there should be no general age limit or UNK to one sex , there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and some open only to men or to women STOP
START the peace corps should not pay the expenses of a wife or family , unless the wife is also accepted for full-time peace corps work on the same project STOP
START there should be no draft UNK because of peace corps service STOP
START in most cases service in the corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary UNK STOP
START peace corps volunteers obviously should not be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the united states STOP
START nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid STOP
START the UNK principle indeed should not be anything like compensation for individual services STOP
START rather the principle should be UNK to that of the allowance STOP
START peace corps volunteers should be given just enough to provide a minimum UNK standard of living STOP
START they should live in UNK circumstances , UNK all UNK consumption STOP
START wherever possible they should live with their host country counterparts STOP
START some special health requirements might have to be met STOP
START for example , it probably will be necessary for the corps to have authority to pay medical expenses of volunteers STOP
START perhaps existing public health service , state department and armed services medical facilities can be UNK STOP
START for UNK to the UNK volunteers should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas service , based on the length of time served STOP
START 7 STOP
START in what part of the government should the peace corps be established ? ? STOP
START the idea of a peace corps has captured the imagination of a great many people STOP
START support for it cuts across party , regional , UNK and other lines STOP
START the peace corps , therefore , offers an opportunity to add a new UNK to our approach to the world -- an opportunity for the american people to think UNK and start UNK in their participation in world development STOP
START for this , the peace corps should be UNK by a small , new , alive agency operating as one component in our whole overseas operation STOP
START UNK the reorganization of our foreign aid structure and program , the peace corps should be established as an agency in the department of state STOP
START when the aid operations are UNK the peace corps should remain a UNK , functional unit STOP
START meanwhile , the peace corps could be physically located in UNK facilities and depend on the state department and UNK for administrative support and , when needed , program assistance STOP
START in this way the peace corps can be launched with its own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those now responsible for united states foreign policy and our overseas operations STOP
START 8 STOP
START how and when should the peace corps be launched ? ? STOP
START the peace corps can either begin in very low gear , with only UNK work undertaken between now and when congress finally UNK special funds for it -- or it can be launched now and in earnest by executive action , with sufficient funds and made available from existing mutual security UNK to permit a number of substantial projects to start this summer STOP
START the peace corps should be launched soon so that the opportunity to UNK the most qualified people from this year's UNK classes will not be lost STOP
START nor should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university UNK STOP
START if launched in a careful but determined way within the next few weeks , the peace corps could have several hundred persons in training this summer for placement next fall STOP
START within a year or two several thousand might be in service STOP
START it can then grow steadily as it UNK itself and as the need for it is demonstrated STOP
START 9 STOP
START what would the first projects be ? ? STOP
START in the first year there should probably be considerable emphasis on teaching projects STOP
START the need here is most clearly felt and our capacity to UNK and train qualified volunteers in a short period of time is greatest STOP
START there would , however , be a variety of other skills -- medical , agricultural , engineering -- which would be called for in the first year through the private agency programs and through the provision of UNK UNK to existing development projects STOP
START the first year's projects should also be spread through several countries in latin america , africa and asia STOP
START 10 STOP
START how will the peace corps be received abroad ? ? STOP
START although the need for outside trained manpower exists in every newly developing nation , the readiness to receive such manpower , or to receive it from the united states will vary from country to country STOP
START a certain UNK about the coming of americans is to be expected in many quarters STOP
START UNK political groups will no doubt do everything in their power to promote active UNK STOP
START but there are indications that many developing nations will welcome peace corps volunteers , and that if the volunteers are well chosen , they will soon demonstrate their value and make many friends STOP
START it is important , however , that the peace corps be advanced not as an arm of the cold war but as a contribution to the world community STOP
START in UNK it to other governments and to the united nations , we could UNK that every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the united nations UNK the idea and form an international UNK committee STOP
START we should hope that peace corps projects will be truly international and that our citizens will find themselves working UNK citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands STOP
START in any case , our peace corps personnel should be offered as UNK UNK in development projects of the UNK other international agencies STOP
START the peace corps is not a diplomatic or propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership STOP
START our aim must be to learn as much as we teach STOP
START the peace corps offers an opportunity to bring home to the united states the problems of the world as well as an opportunity to meet UNK host country needs for trained manpower STOP
START if presented in this spirit , the response and the results will be UNK better STOP
START 11 STOP
START how will it be financed ? ? STOP
START the already UNK funds within the discretion of the president and secretary of state under the mutual security act are the only immediately available source of financing this UNK pilot programs of the peace corps STOP
START if it is decided to make a small shift which may be required from military aid or special assistance funds , in order to carry out the purposes of the mutual security act through this new peaceful program , this will be a UNK sign to the world STOP
START congress should then be asked to give the peace corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year STOP
START specifically , congress should consider UNK the peace corps to receive contributions from american businesses , UNK , UNK organizations and the public at large STOP
START for this must be the project of the whole american people STOP
START an advisory council of outstanding public figures with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program continuing guidance and to afford a UNK point for public understanding STOP
START steps should also be taken to UNK the food for peace program with the peace corps , so that foreign UNK UNK by the sale of UNK food under UNK can be put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of peace corps personnel STOP
START the extent to which UNK bodies such as UNK agencies , universities , international organizations , and the host country or institutions in the host country can and should share the cost of the peace corps programs must be fully UNK STOP
START 12 STOP
START is it worth the cost and the UNK ? ? STOP
START no matter how well conceived and UNK run , there probably will be UNK STOP
START these could be UNK and have a serious effect both at home and abroad STOP
START but as the popular response suggests , the UNK of the peace corps is very great STOP
START it can contribute to the development of critical countries and regions STOP
START it can promote international cooperation and good will toward this country STOP
START it can also contribute to the education of america and to more UNK american participation in the world STOP
START with thousands of young americans going to work in developing areas , millions of americans will become more directly involved in the world than ever before STOP
START with colleges and universities carrying a large part of the program , and with students looking toward peace corps service , there will be an impact on educational curriculum and student UNK STOP
START the letters home , the UNK later given by returning members of the peace corps , the influence on the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad -- all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible american policies toward the world STOP
START and this is meeting the world's need , too , since what the world most needs from this country is better understanding of the world STOP
START the peace corps thus can add a new UNK to america's world policy -- one for which people here and abroad have long been waiting STOP
START as you said in your state of the union message , `` the problems are UNK and UNK -- and the response must be UNK and UNK as well '' STOP
START to the congress of the united states : STOP
START i recommend to the congress the establishment of a permanent peace corps -- a pool of trained american men and women sent overseas by the UNK or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign countries meet their UNK needs for skilled manpower STOP
START i have today signed an executive order establishing a peace corps on a temporary pilot basis STOP
START the temporary peace corps will be a source of information and experience to aid us in UNK more effective plans for a permanent organization STOP
START in addition , by starting the peace corps now we will be able to begin training young men and women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them in overseas positions by late fall STOP
START this temporary peace corps is being established under existing authority in the mutual security act and will be located in the department of state STOP
START its initial expenses will be paid from UNK currently available for our foreign aid program STOP
START throughout the world the people of the newly developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which reflects their UNK desires STOP
START our own freedom , and the future of freedom around the world , depend , in a very real sense , on their ability to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity , UNK from the bonds of hunger , ignorance and UNK STOP
START one of the greatest UNK to the achievement of this goal is the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation of development projects -- men and women with the capacity to cope with the demands of UNK UNK economics , and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages , the mountains , the towns and the factories of UNK of struggling nations STOP
START the vast task of economic development UNK requires skilled people to do the work of the society -- to help teach in the schools , construct development projects , demonstrate modern methods of UNK in the villages , and perform a hundred other tasks calling for training and advanced knowledge STOP
START to meet this UNK need for skilled manpower we are UNK the establishment of a peace corps -- an organization which will UNK and train american volunteers , sending them abroad to work with the people of other nations STOP
START this organization will differ from existing assistance programs in that its members will supplement technical UNK by offering the specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical advice to work STOP
START they will help provide the skilled manpower necessary to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments , acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice STOP
START there is little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve will be far greater than our capacity to UNK them STOP
START wildlife UNK resources STOP
START in 1960 UNK of the UNK million recreation visits to the national forests and UNK were for the primary purpose of hunting and fishing STOP
START UNK and UNK visits since 1949 have increased 8 times UNK than the UNK sale of hunting and fishing UNK STOP
START this use is expected to increase to about 50 million visits by UNK STOP
START the long-range objective of UNK management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and game UNK to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment STOP
START the wildlife UNK management proposals for the UNK period are : 1 STOP
START UNK and complete wildlife UNK management and improvement plans for all administrative units , UNK proper coordination between wildlife UNK management and other resources STOP
START 2 STOP
START inventory and evaluate wildlife UNK resources in cooperation with other federal agencies and with the states in which national forests and UNK are located , as a basis for UNK development of wildlife UNK improvement and coordination programs , including ( a ) UNK , UNK , and UNK UNK surveys and investigations on the UNK million acres of national forests and UNK , ( b ) UNK UNK surveys and investigations on the UNK miles of national forest fishing UNK and nearly 3 million acres of UNK and UNK , and ( c ) participation in planning , inspection , and control phases of all UNK improvement , land and water use projects conducted on national forest lands by states , other federal agencies , and private groups to assure that projects will benefit wildlife and be in harmony with other UNK values STOP
START 3 STOP
START improve food and cover on UNK million acres of key wildlife areas STOP
START 4 STOP
START develop wildlife UNK , food UNK , and game ways in UNK UNK by UNK or controlled burning on UNK acres STOP
START 5 STOP
START improve UNK miles of fishing UNK and UNK acres of UNK by UNK banks , UNK UNK cover , and UNK channel improvements STOP
START protection STOP
START the total UNK impact of disease , insects , fire , weather , destructive animals , and other forces on the uses and values of forest resources is not generally recognized STOP
START they kill and destroy , UNK or prevent UNK and growth , UNK and damage values , and UNK uses STOP
START the loss in growth of UNK because of damage by destructive agencies in the united states in 1952 was estimated to be about UNK billion board feet STOP
START if it were not for the effect of destructive agencies , UNK growth would have been nearly twice as great as the UNK billion board feet in 1952 STOP
START about UNK percent of the loss in growth was UNK to disease , 20 percent to insects , 17 percent to fire , and 18 percent to weather , animals , and various other causes STOP
START these destructive forces also have a seriously UNK effect upon the UNK and their UNK UNK , and upon the other UNK forest resources STOP
START the long-range objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below the level which would seriously UNK with intensive management of the national forest system under principles of multiple use and UNK sustained yield of products and services STOP
START this can be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical fire periods , and a more intensive application of a program of prevention , detection , and control of insect and disease UNK STOP
START in addition to direct protection measures , more intensive management of timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and disease STOP
START protection from insects and disease STOP
START in the UNK period , it is proposed that insect and disease control on the national forest system be stepped up to a level of prevention , detection , and control of insect and disease UNK that will substantially reduce the occurrence of large UNK toward the end of the initial period STOP
START this will require about a 40 percent increase over the present level of protection STOP
START the work will consist of : 1 STOP
START UNK of present activities through ( a ) UNK , more extensive , and more thorough surveys to UNK UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START ( b ) more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial UNK to cause widespread damage ; ; STOP
START ( c ) UNK and more effective control action in the initial stages to prevent a UNK epidemic STOP
START the initial UNK activities would cover about twice the UNK currently being treated STOP
START 2 STOP
START continuation of present UNK UNK control work plus extension of control to UNK acres not now protected but which should be managed for white UNK production STOP
START the objective is to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be needed STOP
START 3 STOP
START UNK a program to control UNK UNK on several hundred thousand acres of selected better stands of young UNK UNK on better growing sites STOP
START 4 STOP
START coordination of UNK control objectives with timber management activities to reduce losses STOP
START protection from fire STOP
START it is proposed that in 10 years all commercial UNK , all critical UNK , and other lands in the national forest system developed or proposed for intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak UNK STOP
START this will include UNK million acres compared with 23 million acres now receiving such protection STOP
START an additional 15 million acres will be given a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation STOP
START meeting these levels of protection from fire calls for : 1 STOP
START expansion , modernization , and development of fire control to a UNK and strength of force which will prevent as many UNK as possible and UNK UNK before they spread beyond permitted standards STOP
START this is to be accomplished by nearly UNK the present level of preventive effort , detection , skilled UNK UNK , and equipment use STOP
START this will include a UNK program of training and development of personnel STOP
START 2 STOP
START UNK and use of new and modern techniques being developed for prevention , for UNK of UNK while small , and for UNK large UNK while running and burning UNK STOP
START 3 STOP
START reduction of UNK UNK conditions to minimize the UNK of large UNK developing and UNK to UNK areas STOP
START this work will cover the most serious UNK of all land UNK such treatment , and will consist of burning UNK acres of highly UNK UNK concentration , UNK UNK on UNK acres of high UNK areas , prescribed burning on UNK million acres , UNK UNK UNK on UNK acres , and UNK and maintaining UNK miles of UNK STOP
START protection from other damage STOP
START UNK control work for the UNK period will be aimed at control of the most serious UNK of UNK UNK , such as UNK and UNK , on UNK areas of UNK and commercial UNK STOP
START these areas UNK about half of the total area of UNK UNK on the national forests STOP
START approximately UNK million acres of UNK and UNK million acres of UNK would be treated in this period STOP
START control would be limited to those UNK for which economical means of control are known STOP
START roads and trails STOP
START the transportation system which serves the national forests is a complex of UNK and access roads and trails under various UNK and UNK STOP
START this system is divided into a forest highway system , UNK by the secretary of commerce , and a forest development road and trail system , UNK by the secretary of agriculture STOP
START both of these systems are essential for the production , development , and use of the national forests STOP
START in the forest highway system , there are now UNK miles of public roads STOP
START these are mostly through UNK that carry traffic going from one UNK to another STOP
START because administration of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the secretary of commerce with maintenance provided by the states and counties , this development program for the national forests does not include estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system nor to construct the UNK to it that are needed STOP
START it is estimated that about UNK miles of forest UNK will eventually be needed to fully serve the national forests STOP
START in the forest development road and trail system , there are now UNK miles of roads and UNK miles of UNK foot and horse trails STOP
START these roads are largely of less than highway standards , and usually carry traffic which is related to use of the national forests STOP
START construction and maintenance of this system is a responsibility of the secretary of agriculture STOP
START it is estimated that about UNK miles of forest development roads , and UNK miles of trails , constitute the system that will eventually be needed to obtain the maximum UNK yield and use of the wood , water , UNK , and wildlife and recreation resources of the national forests on a continuing basis STOP
START the ultimate trail system will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife UNK and fire protection STOP
START it will be carefully planned to maintain optimum service to these important resources and UNK STOP
START the presence or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling influence on all phases of forest management and UNK such as : ( a ) STOP
START the protection of UNK , timber , and wildlife resources from fire , insects , and disease ; ; STOP
START ( b ) STOP
START the balanced use of recreation , hunting , and fishing areas ; ; STOP
START ( c ) STOP
START the volume of timber that can be UNK , especially for small sales and the support of dependent communities and small business enterprises ; ; STOP
START ( d ) STOP
START the level of UNK cutting in dead and UNK timber stands and the opportunity to promptly UNK losses resulting from fire , UNK , insects , and disease ; ; STOP
START ( e ) STOP
START the protection of UNK lands from UNK and UNK by animals STOP
START the existence of road systems permits an intensity of management and use for all national forest purposes that is not otherwise possible STOP
START furthermore , roads that give access to national forest timber are UNK which pay their own way over a period of years STOP
START use of these roads by the public results in substantial benefits to the UNK the roads serve STOP
START the long-range objective of this department is to provide and maintain a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately service the national forest system at the levels needed to meet expected needs and optimum production of products and services STOP
START for the year UNK this means UNK ( a ) the protection requirements of a UNK producing at least 200 million UNK of water each year , ( b ) recreation and wildlife resources used each year by UNK million visitors , ( c ) a timber UNK supporting an annual cut of 21 billion board feet , and ( d ) 60 million acres of UNK STOP
START service at these levels of production and UNK will eventually require the construction of about UNK miles of new roads and UNK miles of new trails , along with the UNK to higher standards of about UNK miles of roads and UNK miles of trails STOP
START about UNK miles of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of new roads STOP
START about UNK percent of these long-range requirements should be met by the year UNK STOP
START program proposals for forest development roads and trails for the UNK period UNK are as follows : 1 STOP
START complete the construction and UNK of about UNK miles of UNK roads and UNK miles of trails STOP
START this UNK about 17 percent of the long-range requirements for these facilities STOP
START approximately 40 percent of the value of the work on roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed by UNK of national forest timber , but paid for by the government through adjustment of UNK prices STOP
START 2 STOP
START provide maintenance to full standards on the UNK miles of existing access roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during the period STOP
START land adjustment , land purchase , land use STOP
START within the units in the national forest system the pattern of land ownership is quite UNK STOP
START in some units , national forest ownership is well UNK together STOP
START in many others , the previous UNK of land under the public land laws , or the way in which land was available for purchase , resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership STOP
START within UNK UNK of national forests and national UNK , there are about UNK acres in UNK ownership STOP
START one consequence is the occurrence of occasional UNK because private owners of some UNK object to public programs of use on neighboring national forest or other federal land , or because such UNK are developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public of neighboring national forest land STOP
START some UNK held UNK are a source of direct damage to these federal lands STOP
START and some , which are suitable for tree growing and for other national forest purposes , are UNK or in need of expensive rehabilitation , and are contributing nothing to the economy ; ; STOP
START there are no reasonable prospects that these conditions will be UNK or changed STOP
START lands in this last category are situated largely in the UNK UNK of the eastern states STOP
START the long-range objective is to bring about UNK of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of UNK which UNK key UNK for recognized national forest programs such as recreation development , or which are a source of damage to lands in national forests and national UNK STOP
START strategy and tactics of the UNK forces are now UNK one of the greatest UNK in history STOP
START the change of emphasis from UNK to UNK warfare must be made with care , UNK that the one type of warfare cannot be UNK UNK in favor of the other STOP
START our military forces must be capable of UNK successfully with any UNK which may be forced upon us , from limited UNK to UNK nuclear general war STOP
START forces and military personnel strength STOP
START -- this budget will provide in the fiscal year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level -- a UNK strength of UNK men and women in the active forces STOP
START the forces to be supported include an army of 14 divisions and UNK men ; ; STOP
START a navy of UNK active ships and UNK men ; ; STOP
START a marine corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with UNK men ; ; STOP
START and an air force of UNK combat wings and UNK men STOP
START if the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war , their basic organization and objectives must UNK to the changing character and missions of the active forces STOP
START quality and combat readiness must take UNK over mere numbers STOP
START under modern conditions , this is especially true of the ready reserve STOP
START i have UNK the secretary of defense to UNK the roles and missions of the reserve components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare STOP
START last year the congress UNK its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the army reserve STOP
START similar restrictions on the strength of the army national guard contained in the 1960 department of defense UNK act should likewise be dropped STOP
START i strongly recommend to the congress the UNK of UNK UNK on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity STOP
START i again proposed a reduction in the army national guard and army reserve -- from their present UNK of UNK and UNK , respectively , to UNK and UNK by the end of the fiscal year 1961 STOP
START these UNK are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the UNK in support of our national security objectives STOP
START military personnel costs STOP
START -- about UNK of the expenditures for the department of defense in 1961 are for military personnel costs , including pay for active , reserve , and retired military personnel STOP
START these expenditures are estimated to be UNK billion , an increase of UNK million over 1960 , UNK additional UNK pay of career personnel , more UNK , an increased number of men drawing UNK pay , and social security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 ) STOP
START retired pay costs are increased by UNK million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel STOP
START these increased costs are partially UNK by a decrease of UNK million in expenditures for the reserve forces , largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the army reserve components during 1961 STOP
START UNK , rates of pay for retired military personnel have been UNK to current rates of pay for active personnel STOP
START the 1958 military pay act UNK from this established formula by providing for a UNK increase rather than a UNK increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of june 1 , 1958 STOP
START i UNK UNK legislation that will UNK the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay rates STOP
START operation and maintenance STOP
START -- expenditures for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the armed forces are estimated to be UNK billion in 1961 , which is UNK million more than in 1960 STOP
START the increase stems largely from the growing UNK of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment STOP
START a substantial increase is estimated in the cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense program , as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications are essential STOP
START also , the program for UNK modernization will be stepped up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures STOP
START further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the congress last year STOP
START other factors increasing operating costs include the higher unit cost of each flying hour , up UNK in two years , and of each UNK hour , up UNK STOP
START in total , these increases in operating costs UNK the savings that result from UNK programs and from economy measures , such as reduced numbers of units and installations , smaller inventories of major equipment , and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the armed forces STOP
START in the budget message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , i recommended immediate UNK of section UNK of the act of september UNK , 1951 ( UNK UNK ) STOP
START this section UNK the military departments and the office of civil and defense UNK from carrying out certain UNK involving real property unless they come into agreement with the UNK on armed services of the senate and the house of representatives STOP
START as i have stated previously , the attorney general has advised me that this section UNK fundamental constitutional principles STOP

START basic UNK communications in alaska are now provided through federal facilities operated by the army , air force , and federal UNK agency STOP
START the growing communications needs of this new state can best be met , as they have in other states , through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise STOP
START legislation has already been proposed to UNK the sale of these UNK systems in alaska , and its early UNK is desirable STOP
START procurement , research , and construction STOP
START -- approximately UNK of the expenditures for the department of defense are for procurement , research , development , and construction programs STOP
START in 1961 , these expenditures are estimated at UNK billion , compared to UNK billion in 1960 STOP
START the UNK , which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement , are UNK in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks , vehicles , guns , and electronic devices STOP
START expenditures for UNK are estimated at about the same level as in 1960 STOP
START new UNK authority for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement ( excluding amounts for related research and construction ) UNK UNK million , which is UNK million below that enacted for 1960 STOP
START on the other hand , the new authority of UNK million proposed for missile procurement ( excluding research and construction ) in 1961 is UNK million higher than for 1960 STOP
START these UNK trends in procurement reflect the UNK changes in the composition and missions of our armed forces in the years ahead STOP
START the department of defense UNK acts for the past several years have contained a UNK which limits competitive UNK by firms in other countries on certain military supply items STOP
START as i have repeatedly stated , this provision is much more UNK than the general law , UNK known as the buy american act STOP
START i urge once again that the congress not UNK this UNK STOP
START the task of providing a reasonable level of military strength , without UNK other vital aspects of our security , is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress STOP
START the last few years have UNK what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history STOP
START some weapons systems have become UNK while still in production , and some while still under development STOP
START furthermore , UNK rapid progress or a technological UNK on any one weapon system , in itself , often UNK the relative importance of other competitive systems STOP
START this has UNK a continuous review and UNK of the defense program in order to UNK resources to the newer and more important weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems which have been UNK by events STOP
START thus , in the last few years , a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was UNK have since been completely eliminated STOP
START for example , the importance of the UNK 2 , a very promising UNK UNK missile designed to be launched by UNK submarines , was greatly UNK by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced UNK ballistic missile launched by UNK submarines STOP
START another example is the recent UNK of the UNK , a long-range UNK with a speed three times as great as the speed of sound , which was designed for use against UNK bombers in the period of the UNK STOP
START the substantial progress being made in ballistic missile technology is rapidly UNK the main threat from UNK bombers to missiles STOP
START considering the high cost of the UNK system -- over UNK billion for the force that had been planned -- and the time period in which it would become operational , it was decided to stop further work on the project STOP
START meanwhile , other air defense forces are being made effective , as described later in this message STOP
START the size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans STOP
START notable in this category are the UNK and UNK intermediate range ballistic missiles , which have been successfully developed , produced , and UNK , but the relative importance of which has UNK with the increasing availability of the atlas UNK ballistic missile STOP
START the impact of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the UNK UNK program STOP
START this project was started at a time when there was a critical need for a UNK UNK to provide an extra UNK of range for high performance aircraft , particularly our heavy bombers STOP
START continuing technical problems involved in the use of this UNK , coupled with significant improvements in aircraft range through other means , have now raised serious questions about the value of the UNK UNK program STOP
START as a result , the scope of this project has been sharply UNK STOP
START these examples UNK the importance of even more UNK UNK of new major development programs and even more UNK and UNK analyses of the UNK of future technology STOP
START the cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development , in determining the most satisfactory rate of development , and in UNK the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it STOP
START strategic forces STOP
START -- the UNK power of our armed forces comes from both their nuclear UNK capability and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any form of war STOP
START the first capability is represented by a combination of UNK bombers , UNK aircraft , and UNK and intermediate range missiles STOP
START the second capability is represented by our UNK ground , naval , and air forces in essential forward areas , together with ready UNK capable of UNK early emergency UNK STOP
START the strategic air command is the principal element of our long-range nuclear capability STOP
START one of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role of the UNK , a long-range UNK UNK STOP
START this aircraft , which was planned for initial operational use about UNK , would be UNK to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile systems , all of which are scheduled to become available earlier STOP
START the first atlas UNK are now operational , the first two UNK submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year , and the first UNK UNK next year STOP
START the UNK UNK UNK is planned to be operational about UNK STOP
START by UNK , several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and their UNK established STOP
START thus , the need for the UNK as a strategic weapon system is doubtful STOP
START however , i am UNK that development work on the UNK UNK and engines be continued STOP
START it is expected that in UNK two UNK aircraft will be available for flight testing STOP
START by that time we should be in a much better position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon system STOP
START i am UNK additional UNK of the improved version of the UNK ( the UNK with the new UNK engine ) and procurement of the UNK UNK medium UNK , together with the supporting UNK UNK in each case STOP
START these additional modern bombers will replace some of the older UNK medium bombers ; ; STOP
START one UNK can do the work of several UNK which it will replace STOP
START funds are also included in this budget to continue the UNK of the UNK wings with the UNK dog UNK missile STOP
START in the coming fiscal year additional UNK of atlas , UNK , and UNK missiles also will be UNK STOP

START 3 STOP
START the present proceeding is concerned with the standard UNK ( am ) band , from UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP
START whenever two or more standard UNK stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely UNK frequencies , each UNK to some extent with reception of the other STOP
START the extent of such interference -- which may be so slight as to be UNK at any point where either of the stations UNK a UNK signal , or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service areas of both stations -- depends on many factors , among the principal ones being the distance between the stations , their respective UNK power , and , of particular significance here , the time of day STOP
START other factors playing a part in the extent of am service and interference are the frequency involved , the time of year , the position of the year in the UNK cycle , ground UNK along the transmission path , UNK and UNK noise , and others STOP
START with the existence of these many factors , some of them variable , it obviously has never been and is not now possible for the commission to make assignments of am stations on a UNK basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstances STOP
START rather , such assignments are made , as they must be , on the basis of certain UNK rules and standards , representing to some extent a statistical approach to the problem , taking into account for each situation some of the variables ( e.g, power and station UNK ) and UNK out others in order to achieve the balance which must be struck between protection against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of stations large enough to afford optimum radio service to the nation STOP
START an example of the UNK standards applied is the UNK ratio established for the determination of that degree of UNK interference which is regarded as UNK STOP
START by this standard , it is determined that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved , UNK interference from station a exists at any point within the service area of station b where station UNK signal is of an intensity UNK or more of the strength of station UNK signal at that point STOP
START 4 STOP
START the UNK ratio for UNK interference UNK one of the fundamental UNK principles which we must always take into account in am assignments and UNK -- that signals from a particular station are potential sources of UNK interference over an area much greater than that within which they provide useful service STOP
START a second fundamental principle is that involved particularly in the present proceeding -- the difference between nighttime and daytime UNK conditions with respect to the standard UNK frequencies STOP
START this is a phenomenon familiar to all radio UNK , resulting from reflection of skywave signals at night from the UNK layer in the upper atmosphere known as the UNK STOP
START all am stations UNK both skywave and UNK signals , at all hours ; ; STOP
START but during the middle daytime hours these skywave UNK are not reflected in any substantial quantity , and during this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference are , in general , UNK STOP
START but during nighttime hours the skywave UNK are reflected from the UNK , thereby creating the possibility of one UNK UNK service , via skywave , at a much greater distance than it can through its UNK signal , and at the same time UNK UNK the interference problem because of the still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference to the signals of stations on the same and closely UNK frequencies STOP
START because of the difference between daytime and nighttime UNK conditions , it has been necessary to UNK different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime UNK in the am band , with many more stations operating during the day than at night STOP
START 5 STOP
START it was recognized years ago that the transition from daytime to nighttime UNK conditions , and vice UNK , is not an UNK process , but takes place over periods of time from roughly 2 hours before sunset until about 2 hours after sunset , and again from roughly 2 hours before UNK until some 2 hours after UNK STOP
START during the period of about 4 hours around sunset , skywave transmission conditions are building up until full nighttime conditions UNK ; ; STOP
START during the same period around UNK , skywave transmission is UNK , until at about 2 hours after UNK it reaches a point where it becomes of little practical significance STOP
START however , in this case as elsewhere it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to all situations , representing an UNK of conditions , and thus to UNK particular points in time which would be considered the UNK points between daytime and nighttime conditions STOP
START it was determined that the hours of UNK and sunset , respectively , should be used for this purpose STOP
START accordingly , the UNK rules adopted these hours as limitations upon the operation of daytime stations STOP
START class 2 , stations operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset ( for daytime class 2 , stations ) or sunset at the location of the dominant class 1 , station where located west of the class 2 , station ( for UNK class 2 , stations ) STOP
START the same restrictions apply after local sunset in the case of class 3 , stations operating on regional channels , which after that time are required to operate under nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other STOP
START with respect to nighttime assignments , the degree of skywave service and interference is determined by skywave curves ( UNK and 2 of UNK of the rules ) giving average skywave values STOP
START these curves were derived by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data STOP
START it was recognized that skywave signals , because of their reflected nature , are of great UNK and subject to wide UNK in strength STOP
START for this reason , the more UNK skywave service was UNK `` secondary '' in our rules , as compared to the UNK , more reliable UNK `` primary service '' , and , for both skywave service and skywave interference , signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of time a particular UNK level is UNK -- 50 percent of the time for skywave service , 10 percent of the time for skywave interference STOP
START allocation policies STOP
START 6 STOP
START as mentioned , the allocation of am stations represents a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of stations STOP
START the rules and policies to be applied in this process of course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired if radio service is to be of maximum use to the nation STOP
START our objectives , as we have stated many times , are -- ( 1 ) STOP
START to provide some service to all UNK ; ; STOP
START ( 2 ) STOP
START to provide as many UNK of service to as many UNK as possible ; ; STOP
START ( 3 ) STOP
START to provide service of local origin to as many UNK as possible STOP
START since UNK frequencies are very limited in number , these objectives are to some extent UNK in that not all of them can be fully realized , and to the extent that each is realized , there is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for UNK achievement of the others STOP
START accordingly , the commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequencies , and has assigned different frequencies for use by different classes of stations STOP
START some UNK frequencies are assigned for use primarily by dominant class 1 , -- a or class 1 , -- b UNK stations , designed to operate with adequate power and to provide service -- both UNK and ( at night ) skywave -- over large areas and at great distances , being protected against interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective STOP
START in dealing with these frequencies , the objective listed first above -- provision of service to all UNK -- was UNK ; ; STOP
START the other objectives were UNK to it STOP
START the class 1 , stations on these clear channels are protected to their UNK contours against daytime UNK interference STOP
START with respect to skywave service rendered at night , class 1 , -- a stations are the only stations permitted to operate in the united states on clear channels specified for class 1 , -- a operation , and so UNK skywave service free from UNK interference UNK they may be received ; ; STOP
START class 1 , -- b stations are protected at night to their UNK time skywave contours against UNK interference STOP
START since the provision of skywave service requires adequate freedom from interference , only class 1 , stations are capable of UNK skywave service STOP
START but nighttime operation by stations of other classes of course UNK skywave interference to UNK service , interference which is substantial unless steps are taken to minimize it STOP
START 7 STOP
START with respect to other frequencies , these are designated as regional or local , and assigned for use by class 3 , and class 4 , stations , respectively , stations operating generally with lower power STOP
START in the allocation pattern worked out for these frequencies , the provision of long-range service has to some extent been UNK to the other two objectives -- assignment of multiple facilities , and assignment of stations in as many communities as possible STOP
START 8 STOP
START as mentioned , the primary allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations on clear channels is the provision of widespread service , free from destructive interference STOP
START during nighttime hours , because of the intense skywave UNK then prevailing , no large number of stations can be permitted to operate on one of these channels , if the wide area service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered UNK by the dominant stations which must be UNK upon to UNK it STOP
START therefore , under our UNK allocation rules , on some of these channels no station other than the dominant ( class 1 ) -- a ) station is permitted to operate at night , so that the 1 , -- a station can UNK service , interference free , wherever it can be received STOP
START on the remainder of the clear channels , the dominant ( class 1 ) -- b stations are protected as described above , and the relatively small number of secondary ( class 2 ) ) stations permitted to operate on these channels at night are required to operate UNK and with reduced power so as to protect the class 1 , stations STOP
START in the daytime , on the other hand , since skywave transmission is relatively UNK , it is possible to assign a substantially larger number of stations on these channels STOP
START additional class 2 , assignments for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference to the class 1 , stations or to each other , and by their operation provide additional service on these channels and additional local UNK for a large number of communities STOP
START such additional daytime class 2 , assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made of these frequencies , and the commission has over the years made a large number of them STOP
START similarly , on the regional channels many class 3 , stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate nighttime with UNK UNK and lower power STOP
START 9 STOP
START essentially , the question presented for decision in the present daytime skywave proceeding is whether our decision ( in UNK ) to assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from UNK to sunset , is sound as a basis for am UNK , or whether , in the light of later developments and new understanding , skywave transmission is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and after UNK that this condition should be taken into account , and some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these hours STOP
START the history of the proceeding STOP
START 10 STOP
START the decision reached in UNK was made after the UNK of a large amount of data and thorough study thereof STOP
START since then , there has been a notable increase in the number of stations and also the UNK of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it , leading to a better understanding of UNK phenomena STOP
START in 1947 , UNK were filed with the commission by various UNK stations UNK that extensive interference was being caused to the service areas of these stations during UNK hours , from class 2 , stations whose signals were being reflected from the UNK so as to create skywave UNK STOP

START and quality of advice , added to devotion to the foundation's purposes and ideals , we do get from our advisory board in measures so full that they can be UNK only by those of us who work here every day STOP
START but the facts about our advisory board and its UNK duties are only one of several sets of facts about the quest for advice , both reliable and imaginative , on which to base our UNK of fellows STOP
START for example , the interest of past members of the foundation's advisory board remains such that they place their knowledge and judgments at our disposal much as they had done when they were , UNK , members of that board STOP
START and , besides , there are a large number of scholars , artists , UNK of music , UNK , poets , UNK , UNK , lawyers , servants of government , and men of affairs -- hundreds , indeed -- who serve the foundation well with the advice they give us freely and UNK out of their experience STOP
START to all , the foundation gives the kind of thanks which are more than thanks : to them we are UNK beyond the possibility of UNK in words how UNK we are STOP
START it is a UNK of business that no business can be better than its board of directors and its top management STOP
START the same is true of every foundation STOP
START during the UNK UNK in this report , our board of trustees named able men , younger than the rest of us , to the board and to top management to insure future UNK of the UNK administration of the foundation's affairs : STOP

START referring further to the foundation's officers , UNK UNK , for eleven years our UNK UNK as associate secretary , was UNK to be secretary STOP

START also appointed to the foundation's staff , as assistant secretary , is UNK smith , UNK STOP
START UNK , like the present secretary general , is a lawyer ; ; STOP
START and lawyers -- with the great UNK that they are trained to read `` the fine UNK '' carefully and are able out of professional experience to arrive at imaginative solutions to difficult problems in many fields -- are indispensable even in a foundation office STOP
START the present secretary general has been the foundation's principal administrative officer continuously since the foundation's establishment UNK years ago STOP
START but even he will not last UNK and the UNK new arrangements are , quite simply , made to assure UNK continuity in the foundation's policies and practices STOP
START the effective recognition of UNK and its UNK has to be learned and is not learned in a day , nor even in a year STOP

START it gives , indeed , cause for UNK to remember what many UNK of the past produced ; ; STOP
START and it is to be noted also that confidence should grow from UNK that great men often appeared in the past to turn local UNK into future good for all mankind STOP
START for example , out of the social UNK of the english industrial revolution came the novels of charles dickens ; ; STOP
START and his genius moved his readers to seek solutions of those UNK for all western men -- until today -- , in the UNK west , these social UNK substantially do not exist STOP
START the solutions were not arrived at by any UNK of the UNK UNK UNK but by men of government -- lawyers , most of them -- and men of business STOP
START these were educated men , who , as mrjustice holmes was UNK of saying , formed their UNK out of experience under the burden of responsibility STOP
START that is , to put it UNK , they had to run their businesses at a profit , or they had to get the UNK to get elected STOP
START nevertheless , they made UNK of UNK UNK that UNK would never pay the `` workers '' -- to use UNK word -- more than a UNK wage , with the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its way into the UNK UNK with the result , in turn , that the gap between the rich and the poor would UNK UNK and the misery of the poor increase STOP
START but as all understand who have eyes to see , nothing of the kind has happened ; ; STOP
START indeed , the contrary has happened STOP
START the UNK between the `` rich '' and the `` poor '' has UNK , in the UNK western world , to the point that the word `` poor '' is hardly applicable STOP
START and the reason this could happen is clear : men of government , business men , lawyers and all who concerned themselves with the welfare of their fellow men did not let their concern to run their businesses at a profit UNK the development of freedom and opportunity STOP
START some would say that they were not permitted to run their businesses only for profit ; ; STOP
START and even putting it that way would not prove that UNK was anything but wrong STOP
START sir henry UNK UNK , a hundred years before communism was a force to be UNK with , wrote his brilliant legal UNK , that `` the progress of society is from status to contract '' STOP
START the essence of contract is that one is free to make a choice of what one will or will not do STOP
START hence , the condition of freedom is a necessary condition for choice STOP
START the greater the range of freedom for individual men , the greater the range of choice ; ; STOP
START the greater the range of choice , the greater the rate of change STOP
START for change is dependent on the possibilities that individual men UNK for the future STOP
START but when there is not freedom and opportunity to choose , men -- individual men -- must remain in status and society does not , cannot , progress STOP
START the eternal truth is that progress -- due , as it always is , to individual creative genius -- is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the UNK of the heart STOP
START and UNK anybody think that considerations such as these are not UNK in a foundation report , let me UNK them with the UNK that , under communism there would have been no capital with which to UNK the foundation , and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the fellows might proceed , UNK in every way , toward their UNK , their creative efforts for the good of mankind STOP
START during the year 1959 , we granted UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START in 1960 , we granted UNK STOP
START as UNK , our UNK are available to assist research in all fields of knowledge and creative effort in all the arts STOP
START we do not favor one field over another : we think that all inquiry , all UNK and artistic creation , is good -- provided only that it UNK to a sense and understanding of the true ends of life , as all UNK scholarship and artistic creation does STOP
START indeed , if pressed , we would say what the late robert henri , american painter , said to a pupil , `` anything will do for a subject : it's what you do with it that counts '' STOP
START thus , we have no part , and want none , in current discussions of the relative importance of science , the social studies , the UNK , the creative arts STOP
START we want no part in such discussions , because we think them largely UNK ; ; STOP
START and we think them largely UNK because , for true UNK of UNK , every UNK and every artist must cross UNK of knowledge and UNK of points of view STOP
START when the brown & sharpe manufacturing company reached its UNK year as a going industrial concern during 1958 , it became an almost unique institution in the mechanical world STOP
START with its history standing UNK all but the very UNK of the industrial revolution , brown & sharpe has become over the years a singular monument to the mechanical UNK of its UNK , joseph UNK , and a UNK UNK for precision and progress in UNK technology STOP
START joseph UNK grew up in the UNK and enterprise of new england between UNK and UNK STOP
START he was early exposed to the mechanical world , and in his youth often helped his father , david brown , master UNK and UNK , as he UNK his trade STOP
START at the age of 17 he became an apprentice UNK at the shop of UNK & UNK in valley falls , rhode island , and following two or three other jobs in quick succession after UNK , he went into business for himself in UNK , making UNK and small tools STOP
START this enterprise led to a UNK combination beginning in UNK , under the name UNK & son , a business which eventually grew into the modern corporation we now call brown & sharpe STOP
START the years of UNK partnership with his father were UNK STOP
START in UNK , a UNK fire UNK their small shop and soon thereafter david brown moved west to illinois , UNK on a land grant in his UNK years STOP
START joseph brown continued in business by himself , quickly UNK the establishment which had been lost in the fire and beginning those first steps which were to establish him as a pioneer in raising the standards of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the world STOP
START much of his genius , of course , UNK from his UNK with UNK movements STOP
START during these early years the UNK of UNK and UNK and the building of special UNK for church UNK formed an important part of the young man's occupation STOP
START he became particularly interested in UNK and precision measurement during the UNK , and his thinking along these lines developed considerably during this period STOP
START but his business also grew , and we are told that mrbrown found it increasingly difficult to UNK as much time to his creative thinking as his UNK led him to desire STOP
START it must have been with some pleasure and relief that on september 12 , UNK , joseph brown made the UNK entry in his job book , in his UNK UNK style , `` UNK sharpe came to work for me this day as an apprentice '' STOP
START the young apprentice apparently did well by mrbrown , for in the third year of his UNK UNK was offered a full partnership in the firm ; ; STOP
START the company became `` UNK & sharpe '' , and entered into a new and important period of its development STOP
START UNK arrival in the business did indeed provide what mrbrown had most UNK -- time for `` UNK '' , and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those developments in precision UNK which most interested him at that time STOP
START by UNK , the new partnership announced the precision UNK UNK as the first fruit of their joint efforts STOP
START the basic significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in UNK by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and UNK engine STOP
START that development , in turn , formed the foundation of still more significant UNK in later years -- in gear cutting , in circular UNK , in index UNK , and in many other fields where accuracy was a UNK requirement STOP
START throughout their UNK , both mrbrown and UNK were interested in the problem of setting up standards of measurement for the mechanical UNK STOP
START several efforts were made in this direction , and though not all of them survive to this day , the brown & sharpe wire UNK system was eventually adopted as the american standard and is still in common use today STOP
START as one development followed another , the company's reputation for precision in the UNK field brought it broader and broader opportunities for expansion in precision manufacture STOP
START in UNK , the partnership began manufacturing the UNK & UNK UNK machine STOP
START as the story goes , UNK , who originally came from the back counties of the UNK of virginia , saw an illustration in a magazine of the famous howe UNK machine STOP
START curious as to what made it work , he built a UNK model of it in wood , and filed a piece of steel until he succeeded in making a metal UNK for the UNK , UNK the UNK machine to take UNK STOP
START when he showed this model as his `` solution '' as to how the howe UNK machine operated , he was told he was `` wrong '' , and discovered to his UNK that the howe machine , which was unknown to him in detail , used two UNK while the one that he had UNK used only one STOP
START thus was UNK the single UNK UNK machine , which UNK in partnership with UNK decided to bring to brown & sharpe with the proposal that the small company UNK its manufacture STOP
START the new work was a UNK to the partnership , not only for its own value but particularly for the UNK it provided to the imagination of UNK toward yet further developments for production equipment STOP
START the UNK screw machine , now known as the brown & sharpe hand screw machine , takes its UNK directly from UNK efforts to UNK equipment to UNK the manufacture of the UNK machine STOP
START mrbrown made important UNK to the arts in screw machine design by UNK UNK the means for UNK the UNK , by UNK automatic feeding devices for the stock , and UNK tap and die UNK STOP
START in UNK , UNK attention was called to yet another basic production problem -- the manufacture of twist UNK STOP
START at that time , during the civil war , union UNK were being UNK in providence and the UNK to drill them were being UNK with UNK UNK STOP
START this process neither satisfied the UNK production UNK nor UNK imagination of the possibilities in the situation STOP
START the child of this problem was UNK famous UNK UNK universal milling machine , the UNK from which is UNK today's universal UNK milling machine used throughout the world STOP
START the original machine , bearing its famous UNK number , is still on UNK at the brown & sharpe precision center in providence STOP
START during the civil war period mrbrown also UNK the brown & sharpe formed tooth gear UNK , a basic invention which ultimately UNK the world's gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics STOP
START up until that time it had been possible to make UNK for making gear teeth , but they were good for only one UNK STOP
START as soon as the time came for UNK , the precise form of the gear tooth was lost and a new UNK had to be made STOP
START this process made the economical manufacture of UNK UNK until some way could be found to permit the repeated UNK of gear tooth UNK without the loss of the precision form STOP
START UNK invention achieved this and , as a UNK , formed the UNK of brown & UNK position of leadership in the gear making equipment field which UNK until the UNK when UNK by other methods STOP
START the UNK UNK , as a common workshop tool , also UNK much to UNK STOP
START although mrbrown was not himself its UNK ( it was a french idea ) , it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance of mass producing this basic tool for general use STOP
START so it was that when mrbrown and UNK first saw the french tool on UNK in paris in UNK , they brought a sample with them to the united states and started brown & sharpe in yet another field where it UNK its leadership to this day STOP
START the final achievement of UNK long and interesting mechanical career runs a close second in importance to his development of the universal milling machine STOP
START that achievement was his creation of the universal UNK machine , which made its appearance in UNK at the philadelphia UNK UNK STOP
START this machine , like its milling UNK , was the UNK of a UNK used to this very day in precision UNK UNK throughout the world STOP
START along with UNK other major developments , the universal UNK machine was UNK influential in setting the course of brown & sharpe for many years to come STOP
START following UNK death , there came forward in the brown & sharpe organization many other men who contributed greatly to the development of the company STOP
START one such man was samuel UNK STOP
START as head of the firm UNK & UNK , UNK began by UNK brown & sharpe to its UNK competition during the UNK and early UNK STOP
START in UNK , however , a UNK was called between the companies , and the partnership of UNK , brown & sharpe was formed STOP
START between that year and the buying out of UNK interest in UNK , a large portion of the company's precision tool business was carried out under the name of UNK , brown & sharpe , and to this day many old precision tools are in use still bearing that famous UNK STOP
START perhaps the outstanding standard UNK of UNK tradition for accuracy was UNK UNK , whose mechanical genius closely UNK that of mrbrown , and whose particular UNK was the development of the UNK accurate measuring machinery that UNK brown & sharpe to manufacture UNK , and therefore its products , with an accuracy UNK anything then available elsewhere in the world STOP
START also important on the brown & sharpe scene , at the turn of the century , was UNK UNK , works UNK of the company from UNK to 1910 STOP
START UNK possessed remarkable talents for the leadership and development of men STOP
START he was an UNK UNK of the brown & sharpe apprentice program and personal UNK to UNK able men who first developed their industrial talents with the company STOP
START in one sense it can be said that one of the most important brown & sharpe products over the years has been the men who began work with the company and UNK came to places of industrial UNK throughout the nation and even abroad STOP
START UNK with the death of UNK sharpe in UNK , the name of henry UNK was for more than 50 years closely UNK with the destiny of the company STOP
START during his UNK , the company's physical plant was UNK expanded , and the length and UNK of the brown & sharpe machine tool line became the greatest in the world STOP
START during the early part of this century , the brown & sharpe works in providence were UNK as the largest single manufacturing UNK devoted exclusively to precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world STOP
START during these years the company's product line followed the basic UNK laid down by mrbrown STOP
START it expanded from hand screw machines to automatic screw machines , from simple UNK gear cutting machines to gear UNK machines and a large contract gear manufacturing business , from UNK UNK universal milling machines to a broad line of UNK controlled UNK and manufacturing type milling machines STOP
START in the UNK machine field , expansion went far from universal UNK alone and took in cylindrical UNK , surface UNK , and a wide variety of special and UNK models STOP
START in 1951 , henry UNK , UNK his father and continued the company's development as a major factor in the UNK equipment business STOP
START the company is still UNK its line and is now active on four major UNK STOP
START the machine tool division is currently producing brown & sharpe single UNK automatic screw machines , UNK machines of many types , and UNK and UNK milling machines STOP
START recently added is the brown & sharpe UNK UNK machine which UNK the company to an entirely new field of tool development STOP
START in the industrial products division , the company UNK and markets a wide line of precision UNK and inspection equipment , UNK tools -- including UNK , UNK UNK , and UNK STOP
START in the cutting tool division , the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling UNK , end mills and UNK STOP

START net income was UNK , or UNK per share on UNK common shares currently outstanding , as compared to UNK or UNK per share in 1959 , adjusted to the same number of shares STOP
START sales and other operating income increased UNK from UNK in 1959 to UNK in 1960 STOP
START this increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development STOP
START in spite of the fact that our largest market , the textile industry , was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity , we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 at a rate UNK higher than during 1959 STOP
START outlook for current year STOP
START our current rate of UNK orders has now UNK and unless this trend can be UNK , our production for 1961 will be lower than for 1960 STOP
START however , the healthy inventory position of the textile industry UNK support to the UNK expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961 STOP
START need for sound tax policy STOP
START in connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient UNK machinery , a UNK UNK tax policy on UNK of production equipment , UNK the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis , could , if adopted , have favorable effects on UNK business in the next few years STOP
START such a UNK policy would also , we believe , prove a very important factor in UNK the competitive position of the UNK and other industries , thus helping to UNK the position of the dollar in foreign exchange STOP
START research and development STOP
START our research and development program , serving as it does an industry which must compete against UNK production throughout the world , continues to have primary emphasis at UNK STOP
START this program is based on the policy of UNK and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile values -- fabrics whose cost in relation to quality , fashion and utility provide the consumer with better textile products for the money STOP
START such policy involves continuing effort to improve on existing UNK equipment , in terms of efficiency and UNK STOP
START but more important , we believe , it must UNK on the development of entirely new concepts in textile processing as do the UNK UNK UNK and our more recent UNK automatic UNK machine STOP
START budget increased STOP
START on this basis , our already substantial budget for research and development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance the continuing engineering and design work essential to UNK future growth in sales and UNK STOP
START much of this necessary increase in research and development , though properly UNK to current expenses , is not reflected in UNK until projects are completed and the new machines sold in quantity , usually over a period of several years STOP
START stretch yarn machines STOP
START in december we began to ship our UNK stretch yarn machines STOP
START these machines produce the higher quality stretch UNK required in UNK stretch and UNK fabrics STOP
START during the past year , great progress has been made by the UNK mills in creating new stretch and UNK fabrics STOP
START fashion centers are now UNK broad acceptance of sports UNK and improved `` wash and wear '' UNK and UNK made from these fabrics STOP
START this machine , operating at speeds up to UNK UNK per minute , is believed to provide one of the UNK mechanical operations in industry today STOP
START it UNK yarn directly from the UNK largest package into ideal supply UNK for use on UNK UNK UNK in UNK stretch yarn fabrics STOP
START UNK UNK STOP
START our new UNK ring UNK for glass fiber UNK is UNK well in our UNK mills STOP
START later in the year , additional types of this UNK UNK will be made available to mills for other UNK fibers and natural UNK STOP
START these machines are designed to provide higher operating speeds , larger yarn UNK , and greater flexibility of application to different types of yarn STOP
START this we believe will substantially UNK the potential market for the equipment STOP
START UNK STOP
START major activity at providence in 1961 will involve the scheduled completion of UNK for production of the UNK automatic UNK machine STOP
START this work is UNK on schedule and we expect to make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year STOP
START this machine was demonstrated in two textile machinery UNK last year and was well received by the industry STOP
START the potential market for the machine should be comparable to that of the UNK UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK has several outstanding features -- it UNK with much greater efficiency than existing equipment ; ; STOP
START it UNK an automatic UNK device on each UNK , and it will UNK a break in the yarn in 10 UNK as well as tie in new UNK as the running end is UNK STOP
START because the UNK UNK process is a relatively UNK operation for the UNK , the almost complete UNK provided by the UNK can mean important UNK in textile production , at the same time UNK quality STOP
START many mills have already placed firm orders for this machine STOP
START new UNK application STOP
START a new application for the UNK UNK UNK , running single filling for box UNK , will UNK UNK use of this equipment STOP
START UNK machines STOP
START a new UNK UNK machine has been developed to UNK the use of our UNK machine in the production of UNK UNK STOP
START it is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to hold precise tension and speed STOP
START this new machine takes up UNK yarn from UNK or UNK and UNK large UNK at speeds up to UNK feet per minute STOP
START it is equipped with an automatic UNK device to reduce waste and handling time STOP
START our UNK machines and our UNK are UNK important pilot plant testing for application with new high UNK UNK , in several fiber producing plants STOP
START we look forward to a stronger position in this expanding field STOP
START UNK plans STOP
START we are interested in further UNK into other fields of capital goods , or components for industrial products , and have recently UNK our efforts in that direction STOP
START UNK UNK research STOP
START our UNK UNK research division has made further very encouraging progress in development of UNK cells STOP
START the cooperation of our exclusive american UNK , UNK & UNK aircraft division of united aircraft corporation , has been important in this work STOP
START in addition to its major effort on UNK cells , UNK UNK research division is continuing to carry on research in other fields , both under contract for the defense department , other government agencies and for our own account STOP
START UNK is currently supplying components vital to the UNK and UNK programs STOP
START we have recently entered into an agreement with UNK UNK de UNK UNK UNK ( UNK ) of france for the exclusive exchange of technical information on UNK materials STOP
START the agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing of such materials in the united states STOP
START initially we will UNK the UNK materials and UNK from france but later we will manufacture in this country STOP
START there is a rapidly growing demand for this material , primarily from the military STOP
START further research , we believe , will develop important commercial applications STOP
START a project for the air force has been completed in which the UNK infrared UNK device was developed for area monitoring of UNK or dangerous UNK STOP
START we are UNK research on the use of solid state materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity STOP
START the rapid advance in science today suggests many other UNK of investigation STOP
START our plan is to keep UNK of these advances , and select for development those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities STOP
START new plant facilities STOP
START early in august we broke ground for a new UNK plant in UNK , rhode island , which will house our textile and UNK UNK machinery operations STOP
START construction is well along , and the plant is scheduled for completion in november of this year STOP
START all operations now carried on at our plant at UNK will be transferred to UNK STOP
START operations in the new plant should be producing UNK early in 1962 STOP
START an UNK sketch of the new plant is shown on the front cover STOP
START the building will contain UNK square feet , approximately the same as our present plant STOP
START however , its modern UNK UNK is designed to increase our production capacity , permit more efficient manufacturing , and substantially reduce current UNK and maintenance costs STOP
START a major consideration in the choice of the UNK site , four miles from UNK , was the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly skilled work force STOP
START we have entered into an agreement for the sale of the present UNK properties , effective as soon as we have completed removal to our new plant STOP
START british UNK STOP
START during the year our british UNK , UNK , limited , expanded its plant in UNK , england , and added machine tool capacity STOP
START the operations of its other plant in UNK and UNK former operations in manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant in the UNK town of UNK STOP
START UNK and equipment were UNK and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis STOP
START the area available at UNK is approximately three times the size of the former UNK and manchester locations STOP
START in addition , land has been purchased to permit UNK the size of the plant in the future STOP
START financial developments STOP
START the new UNK plant is being built at our expense and under our direction STOP
START it will be UNK on completion to the industrial foundation of rhode island , a UNK organization , which will UNK us for the cost of construction STOP
START we will then occupy the new plant under UNK , with an UNK to purchase STOP
START these arrangements are , in our opinion , very favorable to UNK STOP
START UNK financing of construction costs is provided by a short term loan from the UNK UNK bank STOP
START in addition to expenditures on the UNK plant , we have UNK approximately UNK for machinery and equipment at UNK , and for new machinery , plant and equipment at UNK , limited STOP
START we believe that these improved facilities will contribute income and effect savings which will fully justify the investment STOP
START long term loans have been reduced by UNK to UNK STOP
START inventories increased UNK to UNK during the year and should decline in coming months STOP
START thus we enter 1961 in a strong financial position STOP
START employee contracts STOP
START in accordance with the UNK contract signed in may , 1959 , with the international association of UNK , UNK , wages of UNK employees were increased by UNK in may , 1960 , and pay levels for UNK UNK employees were increased UNK STOP
START in addition , blue cross coverage for all employees and their UNK was extended to provide the full cost of UNK hospital UNK STOP
START personnel benefits STOP
START in addition to direct UNK and wages , the company paid or UNK during the year the following amounts for the benefit of employees : STOP
START during the UNK year ended december 31 , 1960 , 23 employees retired , making a total of UNK currently retired under the company's UNK plan STOP
START at december 13 , 1960 the fund held by the industrial national bank of providence , as UNK for payment of past and future service UNK to qualified members of the plan , UNK UNK STOP
START the basic market for UNK is growing with the expansion of the population that began 20 years ago STOP
START another growth factor is increased consumer demand for better quality and larger UNK of fabrics that go with a rising standard of living STOP
START as in many other industries , rising costs and intense competition , both domestic and foreign , have exerted increasing pressure on UNK of the textile industry in recent years STOP
START increased efficiency STOP
START in UNK , as elsewhere , a major part of the solution lies in greater efficiency and higher productivity STOP
START as a designer and manufacturer of textile production machinery , UNK and other companies in its industry have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods that would increase production , yet maintain both quality and flexibility STOP
START problems of UNK styles STOP
START the problem of efficient production in UNK is complicated by the fact that the industry serves large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in UNK or home UNK STOP
START production must be adjusted accordingly , at minimum cost and quickly STOP
START in addition , production machinery must in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural fibers and the increasing number of UNK , as well as UNK STOP
START following the term of service in japan , each UNK returns for a brief visit to the campus to UNK his experience to the college community STOP
START the carleton service fund provides the financial support for this program STOP
START musical activities STOP
START the college was one of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum but as a vital UNK to campus life STOP

START in recent months , much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current UNK in business and UNK are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future STOP
START and yet , despite some UNK with the performance of this first year of the new decade , 1960 has been a good year in many ways , with many UNK measures of business having reached new UNK for the year as a whole STOP
START the shift in sentiment from excessive UNK early in the year to the present UNK of caution has probably been a good thing , in that it has prevented the UNK of the UNK inventories that have characterized many previous UNK in the business cycle STOP
START this caution has been particularly UNK in a tendency of UNK and UNK to shift the inventory burden back on the UNK , and the fact UNK at retail are low in many lines has UNK attention because of the presence of higher UNK at the manufacturing level STOP
START in the electronics industry , this tendency is well illustrated by inventories of tv sets STOP
START factory UNK in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years , while those at retail are below 1959 STOP
START the total value of our industry's shipments , at factory prices , increased from UNK billion in 1959 to approximately UNK billion as a result of increases in all of the major UNK of our business -- home entertainment , military , industrial , and replacement STOP
START i believe a further gain is in prospect for 1961 STOP
START home entertainment sales up STOP
START UNK the largest percentage of UNK sets such as UNK and combinations since 1953 , dollar value of home entertainment electronics in 1960 was about UNK billion , compared to UNK billion in 1959 STOP
START sales of tv sets at retail ran ahead of the like months of 1959 through july ; ; STOP
START set production ( excluding those UNK for the UNK market ) also ran ahead in the early months , but was UNK after the usual vacation UNK in the face of growing evidence that some of the early production plans had been UNK optimistic STOP
START for the year as a whole , retail sales of tv sets probably came to UNK million against UNK million in 1959 ; ; STOP
START however , production came to only UNK million compared to UNK million STOP
START in contrast to the lower UNK of tv , total radio production increased from UNK million sets to UNK million ( excluding UNK ) STOP
START both home and auto UNK were in excellent demand , with retail sales of home sets ahead of 1959 in every month of the first eleven ; ; STOP
START sales and production of home sets were about equal at UNK million units STOP
START auto set production came to about UNK million compared to UNK million in 1959 STOP
START separate UNK also had a good year , UNK the growing popularity of UNK sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to UNK that characterized the UNK market STOP
START the outlook for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present , but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of UNK to step up their buying plans for UNK goods STOP
START i would expect that sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some 10 - UNK but that UNK levels should show a favorable comparison , with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business conditions UNK as some recent UNK suggest they will STOP
START i look for tv sales and production to be approximately equal at UNK million sets for the year , but i look for some decline in UNK from the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of UNK - UNK million sets STOP
START i therefore believe it is realistic to assume a UNK drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about UNK million , slightly below 1960 , but above 1959 STOP
START military electronics to grow STOP
START 1960 UNK another substantial increase in our industry's shipments of military electronics , which UNK about UNK billion compared to UNK billion in 1959 STOP
START it is interesting to note that the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than the industry's total sales to all markets in UNK , which were good years for our industry with television UNK its initial period of rapid consumer acceptance STOP
START it has been correctly pointed out by UNK people in the industry that it is probably UNK to expect a continuation of the UNK growth of UNK or better that characterized the decade of the UNK , and that our military markets may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons systems will give way to concentration of still UNK areas of our defense capability STOP
START while this may well be true in general , i believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding rapidly in other directions STOP
START among the items scheduled for acceleration in the near future are the UNK and UNK programs , UNK of the UNK alert system of the strategic air command , and improved UNK UNK systems STOP
START research and development expenditures connected with the UNK UNK UNK and the future development of ballistic missile defense systems such as UNK are expected to increase substantially STOP
START research , development test and evaluation funds , devoted to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft , and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement by UNK STOP
START still later , the realm of space technology will show substantial UNK ; ; STOP
START it has been estimated that spending by the national UNK and space administration will rise from less than UNK million in fiscal 1960 to more than UNK billion by UNK , and that the electronic industry's share of these expenditures will be closer to 50% than the current UNK STOP
START the UNK defense procurement called for in the 1961 budget has already begun to make itself felt in an UNK in orders for military electronic equipment and the components that go into it , and it has been suggested that an additional UNK billion increase in total defense spending may be UNK for fiscal 1962 STOP
START although the impact of these increases on our industry's shipments will be gradual , on balance i look for another good increase in shipments in the coming year , to at least UNK billion STOP
START industrial electronic equipment STOP
START UNK by the continuing rapid growth of electronic data processing , sales of industrial and commercial electronic equipment UNK UNK billion compared to UNK billion in 1959 STOP
START the market for UNK and other UNK continues to UNK at the rate of about UNK UNK , reaching some UNK million in 1960 STOP
START informed estimates look for this market to approximately UNK by the late UNK , under the stimulus of new applications in the fields of UNK and UNK , industrial process control , and information storage and UNK STOP
START in the industrial field , prospects for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment are also quite bright STOP
START for the near term , however , it must be realized that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive to general business conditions than is the military market , and for this reason i would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller than those of recent years ; ; STOP
START sales should slightly exceed 1960 , however , and reach UNK billion STOP
START replacement parts STOP
START in addition to the three major original equipment UNK of the electronics business , the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues year by year STOP
START this is now a UNK billion business , up from UNK billion in 1959 , and should reach UNK billion in 1961 STOP
START the markets for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected the changing patterns of the various end equipment UNK of the industry STOP
START demand for parts for home entertainment was strong in the first half , but purchases were cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced their own operating rates STOP
START in the military field , UNK orders turned down early in the year , and remained rather slow until late fall when the UNK in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt in rising orders for components STOP
START sales of UNK in 1960 UNK UNK million , compared to UNK million in 1959 despite substantial price UNK in virtually all types STOP
START production UNK about UNK million units against UNK million in 1959 , and i look for a further gain to UNK million units worth approximately UNK million in 1961 STOP
START sales of UNK components , such as UNK and UNK , although not growing as fast as those of UNK were ahead of 1959 this year , and should increase again in 1961 STOP
START in sum , i look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 , with total sales increasing about UNK to UNK billion , despite the UNK in the business outlook generally STOP
START as i have indicated above , i base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer UNK goods may continue through the early months of the year , but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the UNK figures close to those of 1960 ; ; STOP
START on prospects for continued increases in defense spending ; ; STOP

START UNK new responsibilities are in addition to those of his present post as marketing manager of UNK special products group , which UNK a wide line of UNK electronic components , UNK component UNK , and high temperature UNK UNK STOP
START UNK first came to UNK in 1953 as a product specialist in the field engineering department , coming from the office of naval research in washington , UNK where he was an electronic UNK engaged in UNK warfare studies STOP
START during world war 2 , , he was a lieutenant commander in the united states navy STOP
START UNK is a graduate of the massachusetts institute of technology , and attended the united states naval academy UNK school UNK in electronic engineering STOP
START he was named product manager of the special products division of UNK when it was founded in 1958 , and was later UNK to his present post STOP
START UNK is a member of the institute of radio engineers , and is chairman of the electronic industries association committee on printed and UNK components STOP

START he is a member of the institution of electrical engineers , london , a registered professional engineer in connecticut and ohio , and a UNK electrical engineer in great britain STOP
START the promotion of robert UNK to the position of assistant manager of the interference control field service department was announced early in december by UNK UNK , manager of interference control field service STOP
START the UNK was made in a move to UNK the engineering services offered to the designers of electronic systems through assistance in UNK UNK problems STOP
START between meetings he helps the president keep track of UNK matters STOP
START since these duties fit UNK with those of the proposed presidential UNK , one person , with adequate staff assistance , could fill both jobs STOP
START since faculty see themselves as UNK UNK rather than as employees , enthusiasm in a common enterprise is UNK to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that UNK its course STOP
START the faculty believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching and scholarship STOP
START the president UNK faculty members to remember , in UNK their autonomy , that they share no collective responsibility for the UNK income nor are they personally UNK for UNK decisions STOP
START he may welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy , but he has a right to expect , in return , that they will leave administrative matters to the administration STOP
START how well do faculty members UNK themselves ? ? STOP
START there is little evidence that they are giving any systematic thought to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in government STOP
START they sometimes pay more attention to their rights than to their own internal problems of government STOP
START they , too , need to learn to UNK STOP
START letting the administration take details off their hands would give them more time to UNK themselves about education as a whole , an area that would benefit by more faculty attention STOP
START although UNK insist on governing themselves , they grant little prestige to a member who UNK UNK in college or university government STOP
START there are , nevertheless , several things that the president can do to UNK participation and to UNK the prestige of those who are willing to exercise their privilege STOP
START he can , for example , present significant UNK issues to the senate STOP
START he can encourage quality in faculty committee work in various ways : by seeing to it that the membership of each committee represents the UNK as well as the UNK faculty ; ; STOP
START by making certain that no faculty member has too many committee assignments ; ; STOP
START by UNK good UNK between the UNK and the administration ; ; STOP
START by UNK the number of UNK STOP
START despite the many UNK for the exchange of ideas between faculty and administration , UNK of a lack of communication UNK STOP
START the cause is as often UNK as UNK to UNK STOP
START a busy president , UNK with a problem and its UNK and UNK by pressures to meet UNK , tends naturally to assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is STOP
START the need for UNK and understanding makes vital the full use of all methods of UNK STOP
START to increase faculty influence and decrease tension , many UNK have established a standing advisory committee with which they can discuss problems UNK STOP
START the president has little influence in UNK UNK changes , but if he looks ahead two , three , or five years to UNK issues and throw out UNK ideas , he can open the way for UNK , and he can also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take STOP
START success will require UNK , sensitivity to faculty UNK , patience , and UNK STOP
START the critical task for every president and his academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university continually UNK and UNK itself so that its performance will match changing social demands STOP
START great professors do not automatically UNK themselves STOP
START UNK can form an important bridge between the president and the faculty STOP
START they serve not only as UNK for their areas , but they also contribute to UNK decision making STOP
START the president who UNK strong men who have an UNK or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance STOP
START faculty members depend on their department UNK to promote their interests with the administration STOP
START the administration at the same time , looks to the UNK for strategic aid in building stronger departments STOP
START one way that this can be done , other than by UNK new UNK professors , is by constantly encouraging the department members to raise their standards of performance STOP
START the quality of a UNK leadership is measured first by his success in building up the faculty STOP
START by supporting the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever higher standards , the president can encourage faculty leadership STOP
START indirectly he can best help them by UNK that UNK UNK for UNK and promotion are clearly set forth and UNK to STOP
START the academic dean should take a direct , long-term interest in faculty development STOP
START an alert dean will UNK all through the year on personnel needs , plans for the future , UNK of those on the job , and bright prospects elsewhere STOP
START for the maintenance of a long-term program , the departments , and particularly their UNK , are strategic STOP
START they evaluate and UNK candidates for UNK and promotion STOP
START to provide an independent judgment for the president , the academic dean also UNK candidates thoroughly STOP
START at some colleges and universities , a faculty committee UNK and reports to the administration on the UNK of candidates STOP
START some faculty members and many UNK UNK faculty review groups because they either repeat department's actions or act UNK UNK STOP
START they can be effective , however , if their members set high standards for candidates and UNK substantial time to the work STOP
START at one university , the president UNK the faculty review committee as `` a UNK partner of the administration in UNK and promoting the quality of the faculty '' STOP
START before the president UNK a UNK to the trustees , the administration UNK the views of colleagues in the same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere STOP
START the president or dean UNK some of his publications to form the UNK possible evaluation of the quality of his mind STOP
START no good way to evaluate teaching ability has yet been discovered , although some institutions use inventory sheets for a list of UNK STOP
START to avoid passing over quiet , UNK teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion , review of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should be made UNK whether or not they have been recommended for UNK by their departments STOP
START there are certain aspects of personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly STOP
START he should personally consider the potential of a faculty member proposed for UNK , to guard against the mistake of making this UNK serious UNK turn solely upon the man's former achievements STOP
START no one can be as effective as the president in UNK older men to welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or approach to their UNK is quite different STOP
START in particular , the president may have to UNK all his UNK powers to UNK department members to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale STOP
START on those rare occasions when a faculty member on UNK is not meeting the standards of the institution , the president must also bear the ultimate burden of decision and action STOP
START a true university , like most successful marriages , is a unity of UNK without UNK all components into a single pattern , the preparation of a master plan is an opportunity to consider UNK of knowledge at its highest level , which a university -- in contrast to a UNK -- should stand for STOP
START recently colleges and universities have begun to UNK their educational philosophy into UNK goals STOP
START each year a few more institutions are UNK such questions as : shall we require a liberal education built around a UNK core for all UNK ? ? STOP
START or shall we permit early UNK in scientific and technological subjects ? ? STOP
START in the first instance , adequate appropriate reading materials and UNK UNK must be planned STOP
START in the second , more UNK , UNK , and staff will be required STOP
START for the president , a master plan looking ahead five years ( the maximum reach for sound UNK ) , offers several practical advantages STOP
START trustees , faculty , and administration can consider the consequences of decisions before they are made , instead of UNK STOP
START physical plant and equipment can be UNK developed STOP
START proposed new programs can be examined for UNK to goals and for present and future financial UNK STOP
START more than one president has found that a long-range plan helps him to UNK major UNK STOP
START it UNK confidence in his UNK determination to establish goals and to achieve them STOP
START before UNK where it is going , however , a college or university must know where it is STOP
START the first step is a comprehensive self study made by faculty , by outside UNK , or by a combination of the two STOP
START it should UNK UNK UNK , faculty , organization , buildings , faculty work UNK , and potential for growth in UNK and size STOP
START UNK of the master plan will inevitably be UNK STOP
START some departments will attack their new goals UNK ; ; STOP
START others may UNK their feet STOP
START funds may be readily UNK for some purposes but not others STOP
START a plan must therefore be brought up to date UNK , possibly with the assistance of a permanent planning officer STOP
START to provide the continuous flow of information basic to administrative decisions , a number of institutions have established offices of UNK research STOP
START some offices have very broad responsibilities , UNK on almost all aspects of a UNK UNK program STOP
START their duties include evaluation of the information collected and preparation of recommendations STOP
START more often , these offices are UNK to the gathering of empirical data STOP
START the UNK opportunity for UNK education reaches its highest point , as he UNK which projects he will cut back , which he will advance by increased allowances or new UNK efforts STOP
START no matter how high the hopes and dreams of UNK , budget making UNK them to the cold realities of dollars and cents STOP
START when the budget goes to trustees for approval it is the UNK budget , to which his faith and credit are committed ; ; STOP
START its principal features should be a product of his most considered judgment STOP
START he cannot , of course , examine each proposal from UNK STOP
START he UNK and shapes the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote the aims of the institution STOP
START UNK must be flexible to allow UNK to the rapid changes in scientific and technological scholarship STOP
START because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly large sums of money , an institution should choose its fields of UNK STOP
START otherwise it will be headed for UNK , at worst , and at best towards UNK of other less dramatic but UNK and UNK indispensable branches of learning STOP
START in the national interest even the UNK universities must consider some division of labor among them to replace their present ambitions to keep up with the UNK in all branches STOP
START supporting activities -- business management , public relations , UNK -- offer UNK one of their best UNK to buy freedom for attention to education STOP
START here the reasonable UNK of the elements of administration can do much to free a president for his primary role STOP
START in the areas that do not UNK directly to the educational program , expert UNK will serve the college or university better than close presidential attention STOP
START the president should find strong UNK and UNK the UNK discretion to them STOP
START higher education cannot compete with the salary UNK of the business world , but an educational institution can offer many UNK UNK UNK to members of the business community that will UNK the differences in income STOP
START just as the entire faculty should know the UNK educational philosophy and objectives , so should UNK officers STOP
START they will better understand the relationship of their activities to the academic program and they will be able to explain their actions to faculty in terms of mutual goals STOP
START a president is frequently UNK to serve in UNK UNK and governmental UNK , to make speeches to lay groups , and to make numerous UNK UNK on and off campus STOP
START since he can neither accept nor UNK them all , he must be governed by the time and energy available for his prime professional obligations STOP
START UNK and UNK are better received when he explains why his obligations to his institution UNK his acceptance STOP
START by sharing the load of important speeches with his colleagues , the president can develop a UNK of able UNK who will help to create a public perception of the university as an institution , something more than the UNK UNK of one man STOP
START 1 STOP
START introduction STOP
START it has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their UNK STOP
START the results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal UNK of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during UNK ( e.g, UNK , 1958 ) STOP
START when sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and UNK materials of the moon STOP
START observations of the radio emission of a UNK which has an extensive atmosphere will UNK the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise UNK information about the characteristics of the solid surface STOP
START radio observations of UNK and UNK have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets STOP
START the observed intensity of the radio emission of UNK is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about UNK STOP
START this result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the UNK , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and UNK components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by UNK STOP
START for the case of UNK , the radio emission spectrum is UNK not like the spectrum of a UNK UNK , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and UNK components STOP
START of the remaining planets , only UNK and UNK have been observed as radio sources , and not very much information is available STOP
START UNK has been observed twice at about UNK wave length , and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be UNK on the basis of the known temperature of UNK STOP
START the low intensity of the radiation from UNK has limited observations , but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal origin STOP
START no attempts to measure the radio emission of the remaining planets have been reported , and , because of their distances , small UNK , or low temperatures , the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity STOP
START in spite of this , the very large radio UNK and improved UNK techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planets in a few years STOP
START the study of the radio emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at UNK wave length by UNK and UNK ( 1946 ) STOP
START this was followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the UNK emission of the moon over three UNK UNK by UNK and UNK ( 1949 ) STOP
START they UNK from their measurements that the radio emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a UNK in a roughly UNK fashion ; ; STOP
START that the UNK of the variation was considerably less than the UNK of the variation in the infrared emission as measured by UNK and UNK ( UNK ) and UNK ( UNK ) ; ; STOP
START and that the maximum of the radio emission came about UNK days after full moon , which is again in contrast to the infrared emission , which reaches its maximum at full moon STOP
START UNK and UNK explained their observations by pointing out that UNK materials which are likely to make up the surface of the moon would be partially UNK to radio waves , although UNK to infrared radiation STOP
START the infrared emission could then be assumed to UNK at the surface of the moon , while the radio emission UNK at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due to solar radiation is reduced in UNK and UNK in phase STOP
START since the UNK of radio waves in UNK material UNK with wave length , it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly UNK changes in the structure or composition of the UNK surface material STOP
START the radio emission of a UNK was first detected in 1955 , when UNK and franklin ( 1955 ) identified the origin of UNK radio noise on their records at about 15 meters wave length as emission from UNK STOP
START this UNK type of planetary radiation is discussed by UNK ( UNK ) and UNK ( UNK ) STOP
START steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from UNK at UNK and UNK cm , and from UNK and UNK at UNK cm in 1956 ( UNK , UNK , and UNK , 1958 , a , b , c ) , and from UNK at UNK cm in 1957 ( UNK and UNK , 1958 ) STOP
START in the relatively short time since these early observations , UNK has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from UNK to UNK cm , and UNK has been observed over the UNK range from UNK to UNK aj STOP
START the UNK characteristics of planetary radio radiation are the intensity , the UNK , and the direction of arrival of the waves STOP
START the maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute of arc STOP
START this is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large UNK now under construction , and consequently the radio emission of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved STOP
START it should be possible , however , to put useful limits on the UNK of the radio sources by UNK with large UNK or with UNK STOP
START measurements of UNK are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth STOP
START there have been few measurements specifically for the determination of the UNK of planetary radiation STOP
START the measurements made with the UNK UNK UNK , which is UNK , would have shown a systematic change with local hour angle in the measured UNK of UNK and UNK if a substantial part of the radiation had been UNK UNK STOP
START recent UNK measurements ( UNK and UNK , 1960 ) have shown the UNK emission of UNK to be partially UNK and to UNK in a region of larger diameter than the visible disk STOP
START other than this very significant result , most of the information now available about the radio emission of the planets is UNK to the intensity of the radiation STOP
START the concept of apparent UNK temperature is used to describe the radiation received from the moon and the planets STOP
START the received radiation is compared with the radiation from a UNK black body which UNK the same solid angle as the visible disk of the UNK STOP
START the apparent UNK disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that of the observed radiation STOP
START the use of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation , and only if the UNK really UNK as a black body , will the apparent UNK temperature UNK to the physical temperature of the UNK material STOP
START the radio radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should be UNK compared with their thermal emission at UNK wave lengths , except possibly at times of exceptional UNK of solar radio noise STOP
START the UNK level of UNK UNK solar radiation would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than UNK STOP
START at UNK wave lengths an increase of the order of UNK in the average disk temperatures of the UNK planets would be expected STOP
START therefore , UNK the extreme UNK , reflected solar radiation is not expected to cause UNK errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the UNK and UNK range STOP
START 2 STOP
START the moon STOP
START UNK observations STOP
START radio observations of the moon have been made over the range of wave lengths from UNK UNK to 75 cm , and the results are UNK in table 1 STOP
START observations have also been made at UNK UNK using optical techniques ( UNK , 1955 , 1956 , ; ; STOP
START see also UNK ) STOP
START not all the observers have used the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the UNK brightness distribution when reducing the data , and this , together with differences in the methods of UNK the UNK and UNK , must account for much of the UNK in the measured radio brightness temperatures STOP
START in the observations at UNK UNK ( UNK , 1959 ) , the diameter of the antenna beam , UNK , was small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the UNK surface , and UNK UNK have been made of the UNK brightness distribution at three UNK phases STOP
START these observations indicate that the UNK UNK heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do the UNK regions STOP
START UNK UNK seems to be an exception and remains UNK than the regions which UNK it STOP
START these UNK UNK also suggest a rather rapid UNK in the radio brightness with UNK STOP
START very recently , observations have been made at UNK wave length with a UNK 22 meters in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about UNK ( UNK , UNK , and UNK , 1960 ) STOP
START the UNK contours are much UNK than those observed at UNK UNK by UNK ( 1959 ) and apparently the emission at 8 UNK is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface features STOP
START such UNK observations as these are needed at several wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can be properly interpreted STOP
START the observations of UNK , UNK , and UNK at UNK cm and of UNK at UNK cm have not previously been published and will be briefly described STOP
START measurements at UNK cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval may 3 to june 19 , 1956 , using the UNK UNK at the UNK research laboratory in washington STOP
START the UNK diameter of the antenna beam was about UNK , and the angle UNK by the moon included the entire main beam and part of the first side UNK STOP
START the antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measured ( UNK , UNK , and UNK , 1958 ) , so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle of the moon was known STOP
START the ratio of the measured antenna temperature change during a drift UNK across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam ( assuming that the brightness temperature of the sky is UNK ) was found , by UNK integration of the antenna UNK UNK , to be UNK STOP
START the measured brightness temperature is a good UNK to the brightness temperature at the center of the UNK disk because of the narrow antenna beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion of the UNK disk is nearly uniform STOP
START the result of the observations is af where the phase angle , q , is measured in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute as well as relative errors STOP
START this result is UNK along with the UNK observations of UNK ( 1958 ) in figure 1 , a STOP
START the variation in the UNK emission of the moon during a UNK is very much less than the variation in the UNK emission , as would be expected from the explanation of UNK and UNK ( 1949 ) STOP
START in the discussion which follows , the time average of the radio emission will be referred to as the constant component , and the UNK UNK variation will be called the variable component STOP
START the UNK observation of UNK was made on may 20 , 1958 , using the UNK UNK at the maryland point UNK of the UNK research laboratory STOP
START the age of the moon was about 2 days STOP
START the UNK diameter of the main UNK of the antenna was about UNK , and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming a UNK shape for the antenna beam and a UNK bright disk for the moon STOP
START abstract STOP
START experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous UNK anode cooled by a UNK gas ( UNK ) STOP
START thus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc STOP
START it was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately UNK of the total arc energy STOP
START a detailed energy balance of the anode was established STOP
START the anode UNK could be reduced to a UNK amount STOP
START the dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the UNK gas was investigated for various arc lengths and UNK between 100 UNK and 200 aj STOP
START UNK observations were made and UNK motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow UNK STOP
START introduction STOP
START the high heat UNK existing at the UNK surfaces of electric UNK UNK extensive cooling to prevent UNK UNK STOP
START the cooling requirements are particularly severe at the anode STOP
START in UNK electric UNK , for instance , approximately UNK of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving rise to local heat UNK in excess of af as measured by the authors -- the exact value depending on the arc atmosphere STOP
START in plasma UNK as currently UNK available for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than 50% of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode STOP
START the higher heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the UNK can be explained by the physical phenomena occurring in free burning UNK STOP
START in plasma UNK the UNK forced UNK may UNK the picture somewhat STOP
START the heat transfer to the anode is due to the following effects : 1 STOP
START heat of UNK ( work function ) plus UNK energy of the UNK UNK on the anode STOP
START this energy transfer depends on the current , the temperature in the arc column , the anode material , and the conditions in the anode UNK STOP
START 2 STOP
START heat transfer by molecular UNK as well as by radiation from the arc column STOP
START the heat transfer to the anode in free burning UNK is UNK by a hot gas jet flowing from the UNK towards the anode with UNK up af STOP
START this phenomenon has been UNK investigated in detail by UNK ( UNK ) STOP
START the pressure gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the magnetic field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from UNK to the anode ) STOP
START hence , the flow conditions at the anode of free burning UNK UNK those near a UNK point STOP
START it is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free burning UNK are large compared with those for the UNK STOP
START the gas flow through a plasma generator will UNK these conditions ; ; STOP
START however , the anode is still the part receiving the largest heat flux STOP
START an attempt to improve the life of the UNK or the efficiency of the plasma UNK must , therefore , aim at a reduction of the anode loss STOP
START the following possibilities exist for achieving this : 1 STOP
START the use of high UNK and low UNK by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given power output STOP
START 2 STOP
START continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic forces STOP
START 3 STOP
START UNK of the energy transferred to the anode by applying gas UNK through the anode STOP
START the third method was , to our knowledge , successfully applied for the first time by UNK and UNK ( UNK ) STOP
START the purpose of the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish an energy balance for a UNK cooled anode as well as the effect of blowing on the arc voltage STOP
START gas UNK through a porous anode ( UNK cooling ) not only UNK back the energy transferred to the anode by the above mentioned processes , but also UNK the conditions in the arc itself STOP
START a detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper STOP
START UNK was used as a blowing gas to UNK any effects of UNK or chemical reaction STOP
START the anode material was porous UNK STOP
START UNK porous UNK should be UNK in principle STOP
START however , technical difficulties arise by melting at local hot spots STOP
START the experimental arrangement as described below is based on the UNK of free burning UNK STOP
START thus , direct UNK can be drawn with free burning UNK which have been studied in detail during the past years and decades by numerous investigators ( UNK ) STOP
START experimental apparatus STOP
START figures 1 to 3 show photographic and UNK views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode holder STOP
START the UNK consisted of a 1 '' diameter UNK UNK UNK attached to a water cooled UNK tube STOP
START this tube could be adjusted in its UNK direction by an electric drive to establish the required UNK UNK STOP
START the anode in figure 2 was mounted by means of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk STOP
START the UNK gas UNK from the anode formed a jet directed UNK towards the UNK below STOP
START UNK of air from the surrounding atmosphere was prevented by the two UNK shown in figure 2 STOP
START UNK was also UNK at low UNK ( mass flow rate af ) through a tube UNK with the UNK as an additional UNK against UNK of the arc by air STOP
START the anode consisted of a 1 inch diameter porous UNK plug , 1 inch long STOP
START the UNK was national carbon UNK 60 , which has a UNK of 50% and an average UNK size of 30 STOP
START this small UNK size was required to UNK uniformity of the flow leaving the anode STOP
START the anode plug ( figure 2 ) was inserted into a carbon anode holder STOP
START a UNK UNK was used to measure the UNK temperature of the UNK gas STOP
START it was exposed to a high velocity gas jet STOP
START a plug and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided the chamber above the porous plug into two parts STOP
START this arrangement had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the UNK by natural UNK STOP
START two UNK shown in figure 1 and 2 ( UNK instrument UNK UNK ) served for UNK measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along the anode holder STOP
START three UNK were placed at different locations in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its temperature STOP
START another anode holder used in the experiments is shown in figure 3 STOP
START in this design the anode holder is water cooled and the heat losses by UNK from the anode were determined by measuring the temperature rise of the UNK STOP
START to reduce heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the UNK of the arc , a carbon UNK was attached to the surface providing an air gap of 1 inch between the UNK and the surface of the anode holder STOP
START in addition , the inner surface of the carbon UNK was covered with aluminum foil to reduce radiation STOP
START temperatures of the UNK and of the surface of the UNK anode holder were measured by UNK to account for heat received by the UNK but not UNK from the anode plug STOP
START the UNK flow from commercial UNK was UNK by a pressure UNK and measured with a gas flow UNK STOP
START the power source was a commercial UNK STOP
START at 100 UNK the UNK cycle UNK was less than UNK v ( peak to peak ) with a UNK load STOP
START the current was UNK by means of a variable UNK and measured with a 50 UNK UNK and UNK STOP
START the arc voltage was measured with a UNK whose UNK were connected to the anode and UNK UNK STOP
START because of the falling characteristic of the UNK , no UNK UNK was required for stability of operation STOP
START a high frequency UNK was used to start the arc STOP

START UNK cooled anode with carbon anode holder STOP
START the anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed with two goals in mind STOP
START the heat losses of the holder were to be reduced as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat balance can be made STOP
START in order to reduce the number of variable UNK , all experiments were made with a constant arc length of UNK '' and a current of 100 aj STOP
START the UNK flow through the porous anode was varied UNK between af and af STOP
START the lower limit was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous UNK plug and that it became highly UNK STOP
START the upper limit was determined by the difficulty of measuring the characteristic anode surface temperature ( see below ) since only a small region of the anode was struck by the arc STOP
START this region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the anode surface changed size and location continuously STOP
START for each mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured STOP
START to measure the surface temperature of the anode plug , the surface was UNK with a UNK STOP
START as it turned out , a very hot region occurred on the plug STOP
START its temperature was UNK by af STOP
START the size of this hot region was estimated by eye STOP
START the rest of the surface had a temperature which UNK towards the outer diameter of the plug STOP
START the mean temperature of this region was UNK by the temperature measured UNK between the edge of the hot spot and the UNK of the plug STOP
START it was UNK by af STOP
START the mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to the following relation : af where x is the fraction of the plug area covered by the hot spot STOP
START assuming thermal equilibrium between the anode surface and the UNK UNK , the gas UNK rise through the anode was calculated according to the relation af whereby the specific heat of UNK was taken as af STOP
START this calculation results in an UNK rise which is somewhat high because it UNK a mass flow equally distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures STOP
START the UNK gas temperature measured with the UNK shown in figure 2 was af STOP
START the af values are listed in table 1 together with the measured surface temperatures and arc UNK STOP
START simultaneously with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements UNK readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder as indicated on figure 2 STOP
START some of these temperatures are UNK in figure 4 STOP
START they showed no marked dependence on the flow rate within the accuracy of these measurements STOP
START thus , the UNK line shown in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature distribution for all blowing rates STOP
START the UNK in the aluminum disk shown in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of af STOP
START this temperature was taken as UNK temperature to which the anode holder was exposed as far as radiation is concerned STOP
START it is sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode holder , to make the energy flux UNK from the environment toward the anode holder UNK within the accuracy of the present measurements STOP
START the reflection of radiation UNK from the anode holder and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also be small because of the peculiar characteristic of the metal surfaces and of the specific UNK STOP
START the total heat loss through the anode holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical piece into the UNK metal parts STOP
START it was calculated from the temperature gradient af at af inch as af STOP
START the total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby af STOP
START the temperature distribution of figure 4 gives af for all blowing rates , assuming af STOP
START the temperature dependent value of UNK was taken from UNK STOP
START the radiation loss from the anode surface was computed according to af where af is the mean of the fourth powers of the temperatures af and af calculated UNK to equation ( 1 ) STOP
START a band UNK is shown in figure 2 STOP
START it consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by UNK STOP
START there is a small well in the top in which the fluid or UNK to be tested is placed STOP
START a tape of UNK UNK is pulled between the blocks and the tape UNK the fluid or UNK with it between the parallel faces of the blocks STOP
START in normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks STOP
START after it has reached UNK velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded STOP
START by the use of various weights , data for a UNK of shear graph can be obtained STOP
START the instrument used for this work was a slight UNK of that previously described STOP
START in this test a af tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and pulley at a rate of af with a UNK of UNK '' on each side of the tape STOP
START this gives a rate of shear of af STOP
START this , however , can only be considered approximate , as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the UNK of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley during the runs STOP
START the face of one block contained a hole 1 '' in diameter which led to a UNK for the measurement of the normal pressure STOP
START although there were only four fluids tested , it was apparent that there were two distinct types STOP
START two of the fluids showed a UNK normal pressure when UNK shear , and two showed small negative pressures which were UNK in comparison with the amount of the positive pressures UNK by the other two STOP
START figure 3 shows the data on a UNK fluid , UNK UNK UNK which gave a high positive normal pressure STOP
START although the tape was run for over 1 UNK a steady state was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the UNK was built up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate STOP
START a system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of the fluid into the UNK if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time STOP
START a back pressure was then introduced , and the rise or fall of the material in the UNK indicated which was greater , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure STOP
START by this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of UNK ( molecular weight reported to be UNK ) was over half an atmosphere STOP
START the actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand STOP
START the two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were UNK with molecular weights which were stated to be UNK and 300 STOP
START these are fluids which one would expect to be less UNK or more UNK because of their lower molecular weight STOP
START the maximum UNK was UNK '' of test fluid measured from the top of the block , and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids STOP
START it is UNK that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor of the assembly , since different readings were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and UNK of the apparatus STOP
START this negative pressure is not explained by the velocity head af since this is not sufficient to explain the readings by several UNK STOP
START these experiments can be considered UNK only STOP
START however , they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were UNK by the theory in the first part of the paper STOP
START they also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressures STOP
START such an instrument would be useful for the UNK of many commercial materials as well as theoretical studies STOP
START the UNK is a UNK of fluids which is not subject to simple measurement at present , and it is a UNK which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial materials STOP
START such an instrument is expected to be especially useful if it could be used to measure the UNK of heavy UNK such as printing UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK plastics , and bread UNK , for the UNK is related to those various properties UNK `` length '' , `` UNK '' , `` UNK '' , etc, which are usually judged by subjective methods at present STOP
START the actual change af caused by a shear field is calculated by UNK the pressure differential times the volume , just as it is for any UNK or UNK pressure head STOP
START if the volume is the UNK volume , then af is obtained on a UNK basis which is the UNK UNK of the UNK STOP
START although the af calculation is obvious by analogy with that for UNK field and UNK pressure , it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be UNK to include related effects STOP
START consider a shear field with a height of h and a UNK area of a opposed by a UNK with a height of h ( referred to the same base as h ) and a UNK area of a STOP
START if af is the change per unit volume in UNK function caused by the shear field at constant p and t , and UNK is the density of the fluid , then the total potential energy of the system above the reference height is af STOP
START af is the work necessary to fill the UNK column from the reference height to h STOP
START the total volume of the system above the reference height is af , and h can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential energy of the system in terms of h STOP
START the minimum total potential energy is found by taking the UNK with respect to h and UNK to zero STOP
START this gives af , which is the pressure STOP
START this is interesting for it UNK both the UNK concept of a minimum UNK function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential energy for equilibrium STOP
START this method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields STOP
START the relation between UNK pressure and the UNK function may also be developed in an UNK way STOP
START in the above development we have applied the UNK of equilibrium ( referred to by some as UNK ) to the steady state STOP
START this can be justified UNK in this case , and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared STOP
START this has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by UNK that `` the UNK mechanics of UNK solids can be applied to flowing solutions '' STOP
START there is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar STOP
START if the mechanics are similar , we can also UNK that the UNK will also be similar STOP
START the concept of the strain energy as a UNK function difference af and UNK a force normal to the UNK face is compatible with the information obtained from optical UNK studies of fluids UNK shear STOP
START essentially these UNK studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at UNK to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increases , the direction of the maximum tension moves UNK toward the direction of shear STOP
START according to UNK , the UNK shear s is given by af where UNK is the angle of UNK STOP
START from this and the force of UNK it should be possible to UNK the UNK energy of UNK which should be equal to the af calculated from the pressure normal to the UNK face STOP
START there is another means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses in UNK fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature , and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low UNK fluids in shear fields STOP
START these UNK are UNK by the normal forces just as a UNK would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one's hands STOP
START these UNK appear to be UNK , and it is UNK convenient to assume that they are STOP
START if they are not UNK , the conclusions will be a reasonable UNK STOP
START the direction of the tension of minimum pressure is , of course , given by the direction of the major axis of the UNK STOP
START mason and UNK both show that the major axis of the UNK is at UNK at low rates of shear and that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear STOP
START ( some UNK break up before they are near to the direction of shear , and some become UNK to it without UNK STOP
START ) this is , of course , a similar type of behavior to that indicated by UNK studies STOP
START the relative forces can be calculated from the various UNK of UNK if we assume : ( a ) the surface tension is uniform on the surface of the drop STOP
START ( b ) that because of the low UNK of the fluid , the internal pressure is the same in all directions STOP
START ( c ) the UNK effects are UNK STOP
START ( d ) since the shape of the drop UNK to the force field , it does not UNK affect the distribution of forces in the fluid STOP
START these are reasonable assumptions with low UNK fluids suspended in high UNK fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear STOP
START just as the pressure exerted by surface tension in a UNK drop is af and the pressure exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is af , the pressure exerted by any UNK surface is af , where UNK is the UNK tension and af and af are the two UNK of UNK STOP
START this formula is given by UNK and mason STOP
START if a is the major axis of an UNK and b and c are the other two UNK , the UNK of UNK in the UNK plane at the end of the axis af , and the difference in pressure along the a and b UNK is af STOP
START there are no data published in the literature on the shape of low UNK drops to confirm the above formulas STOP
START however , there are UNK of suspended drops of UNK UNK ( UNK UNK UNK ) suspended in corn UNK of UNK UNK in a paper by mason and UNK STOP
START this UNK of the material in the drops is , of course , not UNK STOP
START measurements on the UNK in this paper give af at the maximum rate of shear of af STOP
START if it is assumed that the formula given by UNK of UNK af applies , the pressure difference along the major UNK can be calculated from the angle of UNK of the major axis , and from this the UNK tension can be calculated STOP
START its value was af from the above data STOP
START this appears to be high , as would be expected from the UNK UNK of the material in the drops STOP
START it is appropriate to call attention to certain UNK properties of an ideal gas that are UNK to UNK UNK STOP
START the internal energy of an ideal gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume STOP
START in other words , if an ideal gas is UNK and kept at constant temperature , the work done in UNK it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat UNK STOP
START this means that work UNK q which in turn UNK af STOP
START there is a well-known relationship between probability and UNK which states that af , where UNK is the probability that state ( i.e, volume for an ideal gas ) could be reached by chance alone STOP
START this is known as UNK UNK STOP
START this UNK UNK is , in this case , equal to the usual UNK , for there are no other changes or other energies involved STOP
START note that though the ideal gas itself contains no additional energy , the UNK gas does UNK an increased pressure STOP
START the energy for any UNK work done by the perfect gas must come as thermal energy from its UNK STOP
START a UNK magnetic resonance study of UNK af as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented STOP
START af is paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic UNK as well as nuclear UNK effects lead to line UNK STOP
START the lines are UNK and over the range of field af UNK and temperature af the UNK increases with increasing af and UNK t STOP
START an UNK resonance shift of af to lower applied fields indicates a weak UNK UNK contact interaction STOP
START the general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment af of a UNK paramagnetic sample and is specialized to af STOP
START the theory UNK a linear dependence of af on af , where UNK is the UNK determined UNK constant STOP
START the experimental second moment af UNK to the relation af in agreement with theory STOP
START hence , the electron paramagnetic effects ( slope ) can be separated from the nuclear effects ( UNK ) STOP
START the paramagnetic UNK effects provide some information on the particle shapes STOP
START the nuclear UNK effects provide some information on the UNK of the hydrogen nuclei , but the UNK of the af bond in af remains in doubt STOP
START introduction STOP
START the magnetic moment of an UNK electron associated nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei STOP
START it is important to consider and UNK UNK this influence since UNK nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations of structure STOP
START af appeared to be well suited for the study of these matters , since it is a normal UNK , with three UNK UNK on the UNK , its crystal structure is very simple , and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong af bond provides structural interest STOP
START we first discuss the af bond in af STOP
START we then UNK the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic UNK with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment STOP
START indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects STOP
START the information provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed , and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in terms of various UNK models of the af bond in af STOP
START af bond in af STOP
START theoretical studies of the hydrogen bond generally agree that the af bond will be linear in the absence of UNK of packing in the solid STOP
START moreover , it will be UNK until a certain critical af distance is reached , below which it will become UNK STOP
START there is ample evidence from many sources that the af bond in af is UNK STOP
START the af distance in af is UNK aj STOP
START there is evidence , though less UNK than for af , that the af bond in UNK UNK is UNK STOP
START here the af distance is UNK aj STOP
START a number of UNK estimates by various workers lead to the conclusion that the af bond becomes UNK when the af bond length is about UNK to UNK a , but aside from the possible example of UNK UNK there have been no UNK reports of UNK af bonds STOP
START UNK has studied the crystal structure of af by x-ray UNK STOP
START he finds the structure contains an af bond with the af distance of af STOP
START there is , then , the possibility that this af bond is UNK , although UNK was unable to determine its UNK from his x-ray data STOP
START UNK found af to be UNK , UNK UNK af , with af , af STOP
START x-ray and experimental density showed one formula unit in the unit cell , corresponding to a paramagnetic UNK density of af STOP
START the x-ray data did not permit UNK to determine UNK the space group , but a negative test for UNK led him to assume a center of UNK STOP
START under this assumption the space group must be af and the following are the positions of the atoms in the unit cell STOP
START af STOP
START this space group requires the hydrogen bond to be UNK STOP
START UNK found powder intensity UNK and measurements to agree best for af STOP
START these data lead to a structure in which sheets of UNK atoms lie between two sheets of o atoms STOP
START the o atoms in each sheet are close UNK and each UNK atom is surrounded by a UNK UNK of o atoms STOP
START the af UNK are UNK normal to the ( UNK ) axis with the lower UNK of one layer directly above the upper UNK of the neighboring lower layer , in such a manner that the repeat is every three UNK STOP
START the separate UNK are joined together by hydrogen bonds STOP
START a drawing of the structure is to be found in reference 6 STOP
START the gross details of the structure appear reasonable STOP
START the structure appears to be unique among UNK compounds , but is the same as that assumed by af STOP
START the bond UNK and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal STOP
START however , the possible absence of a center of UNK not only moves the hydrogen atom off af , but also allows the oxygen atoms to become UNK , with af at af and af at af ( space group af ) , where af represents the UNK on one side of the af UNK and af those on the other side STOP
START however , any oxygen UNK would UNK either the already extremely short af UNK distance of UNK a or the UNK af UNK UNK which are already quite short at UNK aj STOP
START hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from UNK UNK STOP
START the only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen atoms to occupy general , rather than special , positions along the ( UNK ) axis STOP
START if the af bond is linear then there are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen atoms : ( 1 ) the hydrogen atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet UNK between the oxygen sheets ; ; STOP
START ( 2 ) all hydrogen atoms lie on a sheet , but the sheet is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other ; ; STOP
START ( 3 ) hydrogen atoms are UNK placed , either UNK or in an ordered way , so that some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others are closer to the lower oxygen atoms STOP
START position ( 2 ) appears to us to be UNK in view of the absence of a UNK effect and on general chemical structural grounds STOP
START a UNK of `` UNK '' and `` UNK '' is more likely than ordered `` UNK '' and `` UNK '' in position ( 3 ) since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another , and also since ordered `` up '' and `` down '' implies a larger unit cell , for which no evidence exists STOP
START therefore , the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located UNK ( 1 ) or UNK ( 3 ) STOP
START experimental procedures STOP
START samples STOP
START UNK prepared his sample of af by thermal decomposition of aqueous UNK UNK at 300 - UNK STOP
START UNK was kind enough to UNK us about 5 grams of his material STOP
START this material proved to be UNK , since we could not obtain UNK results on various UNK of the sample STOP
START UNK , we learned from UNK that his sample contained a few percent af UNK STOP
START since af is UNK , we felt that any results obtained from the UNK UNK af would be suspect STOP
START plane suggested another preparation of af which we used here STOP
START UNK ml of UNK aqueous af with 1 af added are heated in a UNK at UNK for UNK hours STOP
START a very fine , gray solid ( about 15 g ) is formed , UNK by UNK , and dried at UNK ) STOP
START differential thermal analysis showed a very small UNK reaction at UNK and a large UNK reaction at UNK STOP
START this latter reaction is in UNK with the reported decomposition of af STOP
START UNK analysis showed a weight loss of UNK centered at UNK and another weight loss of UNK at UNK STOP
START the expected weight loss for af going to af and af is UNK STOP
START mass UNK analysis of UNK UNK upon heating to UNK indicated UNK UNK and water vapor STOP
START the small reaction occurring at UNK is probably caused by decomposition of UNK UNK , and perhaps by a small amount of some UNK material other than af STOP
START all subsequent measurements were made on material which had been heated to UNK for one hour STOP
START emission spectra indicated af UNK and all other UNK much lower STOP
START UNK analysis gave UNK UNK as compared with UNK theory STOP
START however , af UNK water from the atmosphere and this may account for the low UNK analysis and high total weight loss STOP
START the x-ray UNK pattern of the material , taken with UNK radiation , indicated the presence of no extra lines and was in good agreement with the pattern of UNK STOP
START magnetic analyses by UNK of this laboratory indicated no UNK UNK STOP
START af was found to be paramagnetic with three UNK UNK per UNK atom and a molecular UNK of af , where af STOP
START for exactly three UNK UNK the UNK would be UNK STOP
START an infrared spectrum , obtained by UNK and UNK of this laboratory , showed UNK in the positions found by jones STOP
START electron UNK examination of the af sample showed it to be composed of nearly UNK particles about UNK in diameter STOP
START the particles appeared rough and undoubtedly the UNK UNK are smaller than this STOP
START the x-ray data are consistent with particle UNK of UNK a or greater STOP
START we found no obvious effects due to preferred orientation of the UNK in this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape found from electron UNK examination STOP
START nuclear magnetic resonance ( UNK ) measurements STOP
START the magnetic resonance UNK was detected by UNK a UNK model af broad line UNK and the associated UNK UNK system STOP
START one measurement at 40 UNK was obtained with the UNK model af unit STOP
START a UNK type of bridge was used in the 10 - 16 UNK range STOP
START the UNK power level was maintained small enough at all times to prevent obvious line shape UNK by UNK effects STOP
START a UNK frequency of 40 UNK with an UNK as small as possible , UNK with reasonably good UNK quality , was used STOP
START background spectra were obtained in all cases STOP
START the UNK was adjusted to minimize the amount of UNK mode mixed in with the UNK signal STOP
START a single value of the thermal UNK time af at room temperature was measured by the progressive UNK method STOP
START the value of af estimated at UNK UNK was af UNK STOP
START a single measurement of the UNK - UNK UNK time af was obtained at 10 UNK by UNK methods STOP
START this measurement was obtained by UNK of the university of california , UNK , by UNK the UNK of the free UNK decay signal STOP
START the value derived was 16 UNK STOP
START field shifts were derived from the mean value of the resonance line , defined as the field about which the first moment is zero STOP
START second moments of the spectra were computed by numerical integration STOP
START UNK were applied for UNK UNK , apparatus background , and field shift STOP
START spectra were obtained over the temperature range of UNK - UNK STOP
START for the UNK measurements the sample was cooled by a cold UNK gas flow method similar to that of UNK and UNK STOP
START the temperature was maintained to within about af for the period of time required to make the measurement ( usually about one hour ) STOP
START one sample , which had been exposed to the atmosphere after UNK at UNK , showed the presence of UNK water ( about UNK UNK ) ) as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow at room temperature and which disappeared , due to UNK , at low temperature STOP
START the data reported here are either from spectra from which the UNK water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra of samples UNK and sealed off at UNK which contain no UNK water STOP
START the measured powder density of the af used here was about af , approximately one-third that of the crystal density ( af ) STOP
START such a density UNK to a paramagnetic UNK density of about af STOP
START spectra were obtained from a UNK sample having the shape of a right circular cylinder with a UNK ratio of 4 : : STOP
START 1 STOP
START the top of the sample was nearly flat and the bottom UNK STOP
START spectra were also obtained from a sample in a UNK UNK which was made by blowing a UNK on the end of a UNK glass tube STOP
START the UNK was filled to the top and special UNK were taken to prevent any sample from remaining in the UNK STOP
START spectra were also obtained from a third sample of af which had been UNK to three times its original volume with UNK , UNK UNK ( af ) STOP
START this sample was contained in a cylindrical UNK similar to that described above STOP
START UNK gave UNK life to soap products at a time when UNK were a threat though expensive , and these same UNK UNK the decline of soap usage when the UNK between UNK and synthetic detergent UNK was recognized and UNK STOP
START the market today for detergent builders is quite diverse STOP
START the best known field of application for builders is in UNK , UNK detergent formulations for household use STOP
START these widely UNK products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on UNK , synthetic organic UNK ( sodium UNK ) and contain up to 50% by weight of sodium UNK or a mixture of sodium UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START in the household market , there are also UNK detergent formulations based on UNK UNK with about the same amount of UNK builder ; ; STOP
START UNK synthetic UNK with much less builder ; ; STOP
START and the UNK UNK UNK as well as soap UNK and UNK , none of which are now UNK UNK STOP
START a UNK UNK which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is UNK of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder ratio STOP
START UNK cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of UNK products : ( 1 ) the formulations made UNK for machine UNK , and ( 2 ) the UNK UNK used for walls and UNK STOP
START the better quality products in both of these lines contain UNK builders STOP
START in addition , many of the UNK UNK used for walls and UNK had their UNK in UNK UNK , which is still the major UNK of a number of such products STOP
START many UNK UNK now also contain UNK STOP
START these UNK UNK are discussed in chapter UNK STOP
START the cleaning process STOP
START cleaning or detergent action is entirely a matter of surfaces STOP
START wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium , a solid substrate , soil to be removed , and the detergent or UNK material STOP
START an UNK UNK between UNK and UNK cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved STOP
START one UNK of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of af STOP
START in contrast , a metal UNK af in size would have a magnitude from UNK to a million less STOP
START even here there is room for some variation , for metal surfaces vary in UNK , UNK capacity , and chemical reactivity STOP
START spring used a brush UNK in a UNK study and showed considerable differences in soil removal , depending upon surface UNK STOP
START there are considerable differences between the requirements for textile and UNK cleaning STOP
START exclusive of UNK values , such as UNK or UNK level , UNK content , etc, the requirements for the organic active used in washing UNK are high STOP
START no matter how they are formulated , a large number of organic UNK are simply not suitable for this application , since they do not give adequate soil removal STOP
START this is best demonstrated by practical washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with the same detergent formulation STOP
START a good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many UNK ; ; STOP
START whereas , with a poor formulation , the clothes exhibit a UNK of `` UNK UNK '' and UNK spots -- sometimes with bad results even after the first wash STOP
START since practical washing procedures are both UNK and expensive , a number of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation of UNK STOP
START UNK has indicated that two devices , the UNK and UNK are most widely used for rapid detergent testing , and he has listed the UNK available standard UNK fabrics STOP
START also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general use STOP
START the UNK fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by even the best detergent formulation in a single wash STOP
START in this way , numerical values for the relative UNK of various detergent formulations can be obtained by measuring the UNK ( UNK ) of the cloth UNK before and after washing STOP
START soil UNK is evaluated by washing clean UNK with the UNK ones STOP
START as is the case with the UNK agent , the requirements for builders to be used in detergent UNK for washing UNK are also high STOP
START large numbers of potential builders have been investigated , but none have been found to be as effective as the UNK over the relatively wide range of conditions met in practice STOP
START the problems of UNK cleaning are not nearly as complex STOP
START in UNK cleaning , the inorganic UNK are more important than the organic active STOP
START indeed , when the proper inorganic UNK are employed , practically any UNK or UNK agent will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient amount in a UNK cleaning formulation STOP
START UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK are important inorganic UNK of UNK UNK STOP
START in addition , the UNK are also used , probably acting more as UNK agents than anything else STOP
START the importance of the inorganic UNK in UNK cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers STOP
START physical chemistry of washing STOP
START although there is no question but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomena and their UNK are not well understood at the present , this section attempts to present briefly an UNK picture of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces STOP
START the purpose of washing is , obviously , to remove soils which are UNK UNK in the four major categories given below : 1 STOP
START dirt , which is here defined as UNK material which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely UNK divided so as to exhibit UNK properties STOP
START 2 STOP
START UNK soils , which are UNK by UNK and UNK ( UNK of UNK with UNK organic UNK ) STOP
START 3 STOP
START UNK , which include the wide variety of UNK materials which give color even when present in very low concentration on the UNK object STOP
START 4 STOP
START UNK soils , which primarily include UNK substances and UNK UNK which UNK to leave a UNK STOP
START the dirt on the UNK objects is UNK held by surface UNK to some extent STOP
START however , a major factor in binding dirt is the UNK between surfaces that goes under the name of van UNK UNK forces STOP
START this is a UNK complicated UNK interaction which causes any extremely small UNK particle to UNK with other small UNK particles , or to stick to an UNK surface STOP
START obviously , if UNK particles bear charges of opposite sign or , if one kind is charged and the other kind is not , the UNK will be UNK and the tendency to UNK will be greatly UNK STOP
START likewise , a charged particle will tend to stick to an UNK surface and vice UNK , and a charged particle will be very strongly attracted to a surface UNK an opposite charge STOP
START in addition , dirt particles can be held onto a UNK surface by UNK substances or by the surface tension of UNK , including liquid UNK STOP
START UNK , UNK , and UNK soils are usually UNK onto the UNK surface STOP
START in most cases , these soils are taken up as UNK through UNK action STOP
START in an essentially UNK system , an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless the UNK tensions of the water phase are reduced by a UNK agent STOP
START the washing process whereby soils are removed consists basically of applying mechanical action to UNK the dirt particles and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to UNK off the UNK and acts , to some extent , as a UNK and UNK agent STOP
START UNK soils are hardly removed by washing in plain water ; ; STOP
START and natural waters , in addition , often contain UNK such as UNK UNK which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove STOP
START therefore , UNK are used STOP
START the detergent active is that substance which primarily acts to remove UNK soils STOP
START the other UNK in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of UNK UNK and the UNK UNK or dried soils STOP
START as is well known , detergent UNK belong to the chemical class consisting of UNK high molecular weight and highly UNK UNK which exhibit the property of forming UNK in solution STOP
START UNK investigations of UNK UNK , including the UNK , have shown that there is little UNK or UNK of the chain UNK below a certain region of concentration called the critical UNK concentration STOP
START ( 1 ) below the critical UNK concentration , UNK and some UNK are present STOP
START ( 2 ) in the critical UNK region , there is a rapid UNK or UNK to give the UNK , which have a degree of UNK UNK around 60 - UNK STOP
START ( 3 ) for UNK , these UNK appear to be roughly UNK UNK in which the UNK UNK come together so that the UNK groups ( the UNK ends ) face UNK towards the aqueous continuous phase STOP
START obviously UNK ( UNK ) substances such as UNK , oils , or particles having a UNK or UNK surface are more at home in the center of a UNK than in the aqueous phase STOP
START UNK can UNK and hold a considerable amount of UNK substances so that the UNK volume may be increased as much as approximately UNK STOP
START although the matter has not been UNK demonstrated , the available data show that UNK in themselves do not contribute significantly to the UNK process STOP
START related to UNK formation is the UNK important ability of detergent UNK to UNK at oil - water UNK in such a manner that the UNK ( or UNK ) end of the UNK is directed towards the aqueous phase and the UNK chain towards the UNK phase STOP
START in the cleaning process , UNK UNK soils become UNK in this manner with an UNK film of UNK STOP
START then during washing , the UNK soil UNK back at the edges so that UNK UNK can UNK themselves from the UNK oil mass , with the aid of mechanical action , and enter the aqueous phase STOP
START obviously , a substance which is UNK or temporarily UNK on the surface in place of the soil will tend to UNK this process and effectively push off the UNK soil STOP
START substances other than detergent UNK also tend to be strongly UNK from aqueous UNK onto surfaces of other UNK UNK phases STOP
START this is particularly true of highly charged UNK , especially those UNK which fall into the class of UNK STOP
START whereas the usual organic UNK agent is strongly UNK at oil - water UNK , the highly charged UNK are most strongly UNK at UNK between water and UNK materials UNK an UNK structure ( see table UNK on UNK ) STOP
START thus , for aqueous UNK , we can think of the UNK organic active as an UNK or UNK UNK agent , and of an UNK builder as a UNK or UNK UNK agent STOP
START from the equilibrium UNK data which are available , it seems logical to expect that UNK UNK would be strongly UNK on the surface of the dirt ( especially clay soils ) so as to give it a greatly increased negative charge STOP
START the charged particles then UNK each other and are also UNK from the charged surface , which almost invariably bears a negative charge under washing conditions STOP
START the UNK charged dirt particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase STOP
START this hypothesis is UNK in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic UNK in UNK STOP
START it does not consider the UNK effects of the UNK builders on UNK phenomena which will be discussed later ( see UNK - UNK ) STOP
START the UNK picture of the UNK process thus far developed can be represented as : af STOP
START the influence of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may be compared to that of UNK energy on a molecular scale STOP
START UNK soil must be UNK and protected against UNK STOP
START UNK cloth must be protected against the UNK of UNK soil STOP
START it is evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent UNK acting alone are severe STOP
START upon consideration of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing process , it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent UNK having `` UNK '' properties has gained widespread acceptance STOP
START in the over-all process , it is difficult to assign a `` pure '' role to each UNK of a UNK formulation ; ; STOP
START and , indeed , there is no more reason to separate the UNK roles of the active , builder , UNK agent , UNK there is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous UNK making up a given commercial organic active STOP
START the thermal exchange of chlorine between af and liquid af is readily UNK at temperatures in the range of UNK and above STOP
START the UNK exchange occurs with a UNK yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at UNK using light absorbed only by the af STOP
START in the gas phase , with af of af and af of af , UNK UNK of the order of af have been observed at UNK STOP
START despite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure UNK , serious difficulty was experienced in UNK UNK rates of reaction STOP
START it appears possible to set a lower limit of about af for the UNK energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride UNK by a chlorine atom to form af radical STOP
START the rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity UNK that the radical UNK are removed at the walls or by reaction with an UNK rather than by UNK radical combination reactions STOP
START introduction STOP
START because of the simplicity of the UNK , UNK exchange reactions between UNK UNK and the corresponding carbon UNK would appear to offer particularly UNK possibilities for UNK UNK basic UNK data STOP
START it would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and UNK reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for UNK energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free UNK , as well as information on the heat of UNK of the UNK bond STOP
START the reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies STOP
START it should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic UNK on a vacuum system followed by multiple UNK of the liquid STOP
START it should be possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any UNK substances by the usual UNK methods followed by UNK prior to addition of UNK chlorine STOP
START furthermore , the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of UNK because it would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the UNK energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be too high ; ; STOP
START also it would be expected that af would compete very effectively with any UNK as a UNK for af UNK STOP
START contrary to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree of UNK one would wish , even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure UNK STOP
START we are reporting these investigations here briefly because of their UNK to problems of the study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results furnish some information on the UNK energy for abstraction of chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride STOP
START experimental STOP
START UNK STOP
START -- UNK highest UNK UNK chlorine was passed through a tube of UNK af into an UNK UNK system where it was UNK with liquid air STOP
START it was then UNK at least three times from a trap at UNK to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction being retained in each UNK STOP
START the UNK product was stored at UNK in a tube equipped with a break seal STOP
START of several methods employed for UNK chlorine with UNK , the exchange of UNK chlorine with UNK aluminum UNK at room temperature was found to be the most satisfactory STOP
START to prepare the latter , silver UNK was UNK from a solution containing af obtained from the UNK UNK national laboratory STOP
START the silver UNK was UNK under vacuum in the presence of aluminum UNK with the resultant product of af which was UNK into a UNK on the vacuum line STOP
START previously UNK chlorine was UNK admitted and the exchange was allowed to take place STOP
START the UNK was stored at UNK in a tube equipped with a break seal STOP
START UNK UNK of UNK , low UNK , UNK grade carbon tetrachloride were UNK with af and af and illuminated for about 50 hours with a UNK UNK UNK UNK at a distance of a few inches STOP
START the mixture was then UNK with UNK and with water following which the carbon tetrachloride was UNK on a UNK column , a UNK center cut being retained which was then UNK under vacuum in the presence of af STOP
START UNK UNK chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described above and the mixture frozen out and sealed off in a UNK equipped with a break seal STOP
START this UNK tetrachloride solution was illuminated for a day following which the UNK was UNK onto a vacuum system and the excess chlorine UNK off STOP
START the required amount of carbon tetrachloride was UNK into a series of reaction cells on a manifold on a vacuum line STOP
START the desired amounts of UNK chlorine and UNK chlorine were likewise UNK in these cells on the vacuum line following which they were frozen down and the manifold as a whole was sealed off STOP
START the UNK of the manifold for liquid phase experiments were then mixed by UNK , UNK to the reaction tubes , frozen down , and each tube was then sealed off STOP
START the UNK for the gas phase experiments were first frozen out in a UNK attached to the manifold and then allowed to UNK slowly into the manifold of UNK reaction cells before UNK off STOP
START this method in general solved the problem of UNK fairly equal UNK of UNK in each of the six cells from a set STOP
START reaction conditions and analysis STOP
START -- the samples for liquid phase thermal reaction studies were prepared in UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK about 15 UNK STOP
START in a few experiments the tubes were made from standard 6 UNK UNK of 1 UNK thickness STOP
START both types of tube UNK the pressure of approximately 20 UNK exerted by the carbon tetrachloride at UNK STOP
START the UNK reaction cells consisted of 10 UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK effects being UNK by the fact that the light passed through only UNK UNK and not UNK UNK STOP
START these cells were used rather than square UNK UNK because of the tendency of the latter to UNK when UNK frozen carbon tetrachloride STOP
START the round cells were UNK UNK in the light beam which entered the UNK UNK UNK through a window STOP
START two types of light source were used , a thousand UNK UNK UNK and an UNK high pressure UNK arc STOP
START the light was UNK by the soft glass window of the UNK thus UNK that only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell STOP
START relative incident light UNK were measured with a UNK UNK system STOP
START changes of intensity on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying the distance of the light source from the cell STOP
START following reaction the cells were UNK with a file and opened under a UNK aqueous sodium UNK solution STOP
START UNK af was added and the aqueous and organic phases were separated ( cells containing UNK UNK were UNK in liquid air before opening under sodium UNK ) STOP
START after UNK of the UNK af with af , UNK of the aqueous and of the organic phase were counted in a UNK UNK tube STOP
START in the liquid phase runs the amount of carbon tetrachloride in each reaction tube was determined by UNK the tube before opening and UNK the UNK after UNK STOP
START the fraction of exchange was determined as the ratio of the counts minute observed in the carbon tetrachloride to the counts minute calculated for the carbon tetrachloride fractions for equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon tetrachloride , UNK determined UNK being made for the difference in UNK efficiency of af in af and af STOP
START results STOP
START the thermal reaction STOP
START -- in studying the liquid phase thermal reaction , some 70 tubes from 12 different manifold UNK were prepared and analyzed STOP
START experiments were done at UNK , 200 , UNK , and UNK STOP
START following observation of the fact that the reaction rates of UNK identical reaction UNK prepared on the same filling manifold and exposed under identical conditions often UNK by several hundred per cent , a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether the difficulty could be UNK to the method of preparing the chlorine , to the effects of oxygen or UNK or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tubes STOP
START in addition to the method described in the section above , chlorine and UNK were prepared by the UNK of a af UNK on the vacuum line , and by exchange of af with UNK af STOP
START UNK UNK was substituted for af as a drying agent for carbon tetrachloride STOP
START no correlation between these variables and the UNK of the results was found STOP
START the reaction rates observed at UNK ranged from af of the chlorine UNK per hour to UNK UNK per hour STOP
START in most cases the chlorine concentration was about af STOP
START sets of reaction tubes containing UNK of an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added UNK in another , both gave reaction rates in the range of UNK to UNK of the chlorine UNK per hour STOP
START no UNK reaction was found at room temperature for reaction UNK allowed to stand up to 5 hours STOP
START the liquid phase UNK reaction STOP
START the liquid phase UNK exchange between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride was more UNK than the thermal exchange , although still UNK STOP
START the improvement was most UNK in the greater consistency among reaction cells prepared as a group on the same manifold STOP
START rather large differences were still found between reaction cells from different manifold UNK STOP
START some UNK reaction tubes from 13 manifold UNK were illuminated in the temperature range from 40 to UNK in a further UNK to determine the cause of the UNK and to obtain information on the UNK energy and the effect of light intensity STOP
START in all cases there was readily UNK exchange after as little as one hour of UNK STOP
START by UNK reaction cells sealed from the same manifold temperature UNK corresponding to UNK energies ranging from 11 to 18 af was observed while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases STOP
START it was possible to make estimates of the UNK yield by UNK the extent of reduction of a UNK UNK UNK solution illuminated for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate UNK based on the differences in the UNK spectra of UNK UNK and of chlorine , and considering the UNK distribution of the light source STOP
START these estimates indicated that the UNK yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride at UNK is of the order of magnitude of unity STOP
START when typical reaction cells to which UNK of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated , chlorine and UNK were produced STOP
START exchange was also observed in these cells , which had chlorine present at af STOP
START the UNK exchange in the gas phase STOP
START -- although there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace UNK or to variation in wall effects , the UNK exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently UNK so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of UNK information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate STOP
START data on such UNK together with data on the effect of light intensity are given in table 1 STOP
START , STOP
START in series 1 , the relative light intensity was varied by varying the distance of the UNK from the reaction cell over the range from UNK to UNK cm STOP
START the last column shows the rate of exchange that would have been observed at a relative intensity of 4 ( UNK UNK ) calculated on the assumptions that the incident light intensity is UNK proportional to the square of the distance of the UNK from the cell and that the rate is directly proportional to the incident light intensity STOP
START direct UNK of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in UNK the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series 2 , where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen STOP
START the UNK effect ( UNK , UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK and UNK , 1950 ) , which is a UNK of the UNK motion of particles by the UNK UNK of the UNK force of the UNK solar radiation , causes the dust to UNK into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the earth STOP
START the UNK velocity UNK UNK as the particle size -- a UNK particle near the orbit of UNK would reach the sun in about 60 million years STOP
START UNK ( 1955 ) UNK the effects to include the UNK pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the UNK STOP
START further , the UNK radiation , i.e, the UNK UNK , must UNK away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow UNK in size , with a resultant increase in both the UNK effect and the ratio of the UNK force to the UNK force STOP
START the UNK effect causes the UNK axis of UNK to UNK more rapidly than the UNK axis , with a UNK tendency toward circular UNK as the particles move toward the sun STOP
START also , planetary UNK UNK increases the dust concentration near the plane of the UNK as the sun is approached STOP
START at one UNK unit from the sun ( the earth's distance ) the dust UNK are probably nearly circular STOP
START if such is the case , the particles within a distance of about af of the earth will have , relative to the earth , a UNK energy less than their potential energy and they will be captured into UNK about the earth STOP
START de UNK ( 1955 ) has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the UNK effect , which in this case causes the UNK to become more and more UNK without changing the UNK axis STOP
START this effect can give rise to a UNK of UNK around the earth STOP
START since there is a UNK loss of UNK material in space because of the radiation effects , there must be a UNK UNK : otherwise , UNK would have disappeared from UNK space STOP
START there are several possible sources STOP
START according to UNK ( 1955 ) , UNK UNK is sufficient to UNK the material UNK into the sun , maintaining a fairly steady state STOP
START UNK UNK are also thought to contribute material STOP
START it is also possible that some of the dust in the UNK of the earth UNK from UNK UNK upon the moon STOP
START UNK direct measurements of UNK flux STOP
START one cannot make a very satisfactory UNK about the UNK flux in space STOP
START even in the neighborhood of the earth , where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly , the derived flux values vary by at least four orders of magnitude STOP
START this large UNK UNK the UNK of the experimental methods and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved STOP
START beyond a few million UNK from the earth , but still in the region of the earth's orbit , a UNK of the flux of dust is even more UNK STOP
START at greater distances from the sun , the situation is still less certain STOP
START there are several sources of evidence on the UNK environment STOP
START direct information has been obtained from UNK and UNK equipped with impact UNK STOP
START in addition , the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of UNK may be UNK to the UNK UNK STOP
START from the brightness of the f component of the solar UNK and the brightness of the UNK light , an estimate of the particle UNK , UNK , and UNK distribution can be derived for regions of space near the UNK plane STOP
START another important source of evidence only recently receiving much attention is the analysis of UNK dust for a UNK component STOP
START the UNK of UNK UNK and content of UNK in remote regions are valuable in this category STOP
START the data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the earth STOP
START the direct evidence on the UNK environment near the earth is obtained from UNK UNK ( essentially UNK ) and from wire UNK ; ; STOP
START these instruments are installed on UNK , UNK , and space UNK STOP
START UNK , the most significant data have been collected from the UNK on 1958 UNK ( UNK 1 ) , 1958 UNK 2 ( UNK 3 ) , and 1959 UNK ( UNK 3 ) STOP
START these vehicles , with large sensitive areas , have collected data for long enough times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure STOP
START many other vehicles with smaller UNK UNK products contribute some information STOP
START the impact rate on 1958 UNK for UNK events was af for particles of mass greater than af ( UNK , 1960 ) ; ; STOP
START this mass UNK was derived from the UNK UNK and an assumed impact velocity of af STOP
START the data show daily and UNK variations STOP
START ninety per cent of the UNK recorded UNK occurred between UNK and UNK , and from day to day the variation of the rate was as much as an order of magnitude STOP
START one may conclude that most of the detected UNK material is concentrated in UNK UNK which UNK the earth's orbit STOP
START there have been UNK reports from 1958 UNK 2 , and the data quoted here are believed to be the more reliable STOP
START on may 15 , a very large increase occurred with af of mass between af and af ; ; STOP
START for the next two days , the impact rate was af ; ; STOP
START and for the next nine days , the impact rate was less than af ( UNK , 1960 ) STOP
START the data for the first day indicate a UNK stream with a very high concentration of particles and may have led to the high estimates of UNK flux STOP
START preliminary data from 1959 UNK give an average impact rate of af for masses larger than af for about UNK events in a UNK period ( UNK and alexander , 1960 ) STOP
START the UNK rate varied by less than a factor of UNK STOP
START the data have not yet been analyzed for UNK variations STOP
START note that the mass UNK is four times that of 1958 UNK and that the flux is one fifth as large STOP
START if one UNK that the average flux did not change between measurements , a UNK curve is obtained which UNK the flux of particles larger than a given UNK to the UNK 7 power of the UNK STOP
START space UNK have UNK little information STOP
START pioneer 1 , recorded a decrease in flux with distance from the earth on the basis of 11 counts in 9 hours STOP
START with UNK sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few counts , the second and third russian space UNK indicate that the flux of the UNK particles detected is less than that of larger ones STOP
START being based on so few events , these results are of UNK validity STOP
START the UNK of UNK UNK in terms of the particle UNK is very UNK STOP
START many workers believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles , a relation UNK from laboratory results UNK UNK to UNK UNK STOP
START however , one must expect that UNK and UNK of material by UNK UNK would cause a deviation from a linear relationship STOP
START in the united states , most of the UNK are UNK by UNK small UNK on their sensitive surfaces STOP
START the russian UNK claim that only a small fraction of the UNK from the UNK is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of UNK material from the UNK STOP
START this `` UNK '' momentum is UNK related to the particle energy STOP
START they quote about the same mass UNK as that of the UNK , but a momentum UNK about 40 times greater STOP
START there is a difference in the experimental arrangement , in that the UNK are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the russian instruments are isolated from the skin STOP
START the UNK mass is derived from the momentum UNK with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of af in the UNK and af in the UNK STOP
START the UNK mass of about af UNK to a UNK sphere of density af STOP
START however , the conversion from mass to size is UNK , since many photographic UNK give evidence of a UNK , UNK bound UNK structure with UNK as low as af STOP
START to what extent such low density applies to UNK is unknown STOP
START the velocity value used is also open to some question ; ; STOP
START if a substantial fraction of the dust is UNK about the earth , only about one third the UNK average velocity should be used in UNK the mass STOP
START UNK light and the UNK give some evidence for such a dust UNK , a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture is in circular UNK about the sun , as indicated by the trend of the smaller visible UNK STOP
START the UNK variation in the observed flux may be partly due to the dependence of the UNK sensitivity on the incident velocity STOP
START the flux of UNK in the neighborhood of the earth can be estimated by UNK from radar and visual UNK data STOP
START a summary of UNK data , prepared by UNK ( 1958 ) on the basis of photographic , visual , and radar evidence , is given in table UNK STOP
START from an estimated mass of 25 g for a UNK UNK , the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of UNK for each unit increase in magnitude STOP
START the UNK is calculated from the mass by assuming UNK of density af except for the UNK particles , which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of UNK pressure STOP
START the flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual UNK STOP
START it is assumed that the flux values increase by a factor of UNK per magnitude , in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant STOP
START the values agree with the data from 1958 UNK and 1959 UNK STOP
START the figures in the UNK column are derived with the assumption of 50 per cent UNK by the earth ; ; STOP
START hence , these figures apply immediately above the earth's atmosphere STOP
START the UNK flux is given in the last column ; ; STOP
START these figures constitute the best estimate for the flux in UNK space near the earth STOP
START of course , if there is a dust UNK around the earth , the UNK in UNK space should be less than the figures given here STOP
START note that the mass scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously used ; ; STOP
START for example , UNK ( 1948 ) derived a scale of UNK g for a af , UNK UNK STOP
START the older UNK were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of UNK energy into light STOP
START the mass scale used in table UNK was derived on the assumption that the motion of the UNK trail is related to the momentum transfer to the trail by the UNK , UNK the calculation of the mass if the velocity is known ( cook and UNK , 1958 ) STOP
START a concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the UNK magnitude ( UNK and UNK , 1959 ) STOP
START UNK of this relationship through the UNK magnitude covers the range of UNK STOP
START the approximate equation is af , where n is the number of af with electron UNK greater than or equal to af , and q is proportional to the mass of the UNK STOP
START therefore , n is UNK proportional to the UNK UNK and in fair agreement with the UNK 7 power derived from 1958 UNK and 1959 UNK data STOP
START at the UNK magnitude , af , and at the UNK magnitude , af STOP
START these UNK UNK are about an order of magnitude less than the values from the UNK data and the figures in UNK table STOP
START the UNK may be in error for several reasons STOP
START the UNK data determining the concentration distribution have a range of error which is UNK in the extension into the UNK region STOP
START the UNK and UNK pressure and the associated UNK effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size UNK and UNK the distribution and limit UNK to larger than a few UNK STOP
START also , it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar UNK ( best , 1960 ) , and the same distribution would not be expected STOP
START UNK STOP
START indirect indications of UNK flux STOP
START a measure of the total mass UNK of UNK material by the earth is obtained from analyses of UNK UNK and dust collected in remote regions ( UNK , 1960 ) STOP
START most UNK material , by the time it reaches the earth's surface , has been reduced to dust or to UNK of UNK material in its passage through the atmosphere STOP
START for all UNK , the average UNK content is about UNK per cent STOP
START this is much higher than the UNK content of UNK UNK and UNK and provides a basis for the determination of the UNK mass UNK STOP
START present data indicate an UNK of about af tons per year over the entire UNK , or about af STOP
START biological warfare STOP
START biological warfare is the UNK use of living microorganisms or their UNK products for the purpose of destroying or reducing the military effectiveness of man STOP
START it is the UNK of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development , resulting in the production of UNK weapons systems STOP
START man may also be UNK UNK by damage to his food crops or domestic animals STOP
START biological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon STOP
START the major reason for this is that it has no UNK effect STOP
START the UNK period of infectious disease , plus a variable period of UNK even before a UNK effect , UNK this weapon UNK for UNK encounter STOP
START a man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the UNK period of most infectious diseases STOP
START thus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on UNK population centers such as large cities STOP
START an important operational procedure in UNK for an enemy would be to create an UNK or cloud of agent over the target area STOP
START this concept has UNK much basic research concerning the behavior of UNK biological materials , the UNK of respiratory UNK , the medical management of such diseases and defense against their occurrence STOP
START the biological and physical properties of infectious particles have been studied UNK during the past fifteen years STOP
START much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the UNK exposure of experimental animals to UNK of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics STOP
START much information has been gathered relative to UNK sampling and UNK techniques STOP
START much of the older experimental work on respiratory UNK was accomplished by very artificial procedures STOP
START the UNK UNK of a fluid UNK of infectious agent in an UNK animal is far different from exposure , through natural UNK , to UNK UNK STOP
START the importance of particle size in such UNK has been thoroughly demonstrated STOP
START the natural UNK and physiological UNK features of the upper respiratory UNK , such as the UNK of the nose and the UNK of the UNK and larger UNK , are capable of UNK out the larger particles to which we are UNK exposed in our daily existence STOP
START very small particles , however , in a size range of 1 to 4 UNK in diameter are capable of passing these UNK UNK and entering the UNK bed of the lungs STOP
START this area is highly UNK to UNK STOP
START the entrance and retention of infectious particles in the UNK amounts almost to an UNK UNK STOP
START the relationship between particle size and infectious UNK is illustrated in table 1 STOP
START in considering UNK defense , it must be recognized that a number of critical UNK UNK must be met for an UNK to exhibit optimum effect STOP
START for example , bright UNK is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air STOP
START there are optimal UNK requirements for various agents when UNK STOP
START neutral or UNK UNK conditions are necessary for a cloud to travel along the surface STOP
START it will rise during UNK conditions STOP
START there are , of course , certain times during the UNK daily cycle when most of these conditions will be met STOP
START certain other properties of small particles , in addition to those already mentioned in connection with penetration of the respiratory UNK , are UNK in defense considerations STOP
START the smaller the particle the further it will travel UNK before UNK out STOP
START an UNK of such small particles , moreover , UNK through structures in much the same manner as a gas STOP
START there may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion through buildings such as widespread UNK of UNK , UNK , food stores , UNK , etc STOP
START depending on the UNK , there may be UNK in some food or UNK products , i.e, in milk for example STOP
START the secondary consequences from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for defense STOP
START something of the behavior of clouds of small particles can be illustrated by the following field trials : STOP
START in the first trial an UNK substance was UNK from a boat UNK some ten miles off shore under UNK selected UNK conditions STOP
START UNK UNK UNK in particles of 2 UNK in size were UNK STOP
START this material UNK under ultraviolet light which UNK its sampling and assessment STOP
START four hundred and fifty pounds was UNK while the ship was traveling a distance of UNK miles STOP
START figure 1 describes the results obtained in this trial STOP
START the particles traveled a maximum detected distance of some UNK miles STOP
START from these UNK UNK it can be seen that an area of over UNK square miles was covered STOP
START these UNK could have been increased by increasing the source strength which was small in this case STOP
START the behavior of a biological UNK , on a much smaller scale , is illustrated by a specific field trial conducted with a UNK UNK STOP
START an aqueous UNK of the UNK of UNK , UNK , generally known as UNK UNK , was UNK using UNK available UNK STOP
START a satisfactory cloud was produced even though these UNK were only about 5 per cent efficient in producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 UNK STOP
START in this test , UNK UNK of a UNK , having a count of af UNK per ml , or a total of approximately af UNK , was UNK STOP
START the UNK operation was conducted from the rear UNK of a small naval UNK , UNK two miles UNK and vertical to an UNK UNK STOP
START UNK continued along a UNK course STOP
START this operation was started at UNK UNK UNK for 29 minutes STOP
START there was a slight UNK condition , a moderate UNK , and 100 per cent relative UNK STOP
START a network of sampling stations had been set up on shore STOP
START these were located at the homes of government employees , in government offices , buildings and UNK within the trial area STOP
START a rough attempt was made to UNK the vertical profile of the cloud by taking samples from outside the windows on the first , UNK , and UNK UNK of a government office building STOP
START all UNK were operated for a period of two hours except one , which was operated for four hours STOP
START in this instance , there was a UNK of UNK during the first two hours and a total UNK of UNK for the UNK period , a UNK increase STOP
START this suggests that the sampling period , particularly at the more distant locations , should have been increased STOP
START as can be seen from figure 2 , an extensive area was covered by this UNK STOP
START the maximum distance UNK was 23 miles from the source STOP
START as can be seen from these UNK UNK , approximately 100 square miles was covered within the area UNK STOP
START it is quite likely that an even greater area was covered , particularly UNK STOP
START the UNK in the three levels of the vertical profile were : af STOP
START STOP
START this was not , of course , enough sampling to give a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion of the UNK STOP
START a number of unique medical problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather than by natural UNK of entry STOP
START some agents have been shown to be much more UNK or infectious to experimental animals when exposed to UNK of optimum particle size than by the natural UNK STOP
START UNK UNK , for example , is several UNK more UNK by this route than when given per UNK STOP
START in some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure , making UNK difficult STOP
START in UNK produced by UNK exposure , one would not expect to find the classical UNK of `` UNK fever '' on a finger STOP
START an enemy would obviously choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious STOP
START agents that are known to cause frequent UNK among laboratory workers such as those causing q fever , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , etc, belong in this category STOP
START an agent would likely be selected which would possess sufficient UNK and UNK stability to meet realistic minimal UNK requirements STOP
START it is , obviously , a proper goal of research to improve on this property STOP
START in this connection it should be capable of being UNK without excessive destruction STOP
START moreover , it should not be so UNK in its growth requirements as to make production on a UNK significant scale UNK STOP
START an UNK would use an agent against which there was a minimal naturally acquired or UNK induced UNK in a target population STOP
START a solid UNK is the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be UNK STOP
START it must be remembered , however , that there are many agents for which there is no solid UNK and a UNK or UNK UNK may be broken by an appropriate UNK of agent STOP
START there is a broad spectrum of UNK from which selection for a specified military purpose might be made STOP
START an enemy might choose an UNK UNK UNK , a UNK disease UNK or one causing a high rate of UNK STOP
START it is possible that certain UNK forms may be produced such as UNK UNK UNK STOP
START UNK may also be developed with changes in UNK properties that are of importance in identification STOP
START all of these considerations are of critical importance in considering defense and medical management STOP
START biological agents are , of course , highly UNK STOP
START they do not destroy physical structures as is true of high UNK STOP
START this may be of UNK importance in considering military objectives STOP
START the question of epidemic disease UNK some discussion STOP
START only a limited effort has been devoted to this problem STOP
START some of those who question the value of UNK have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment of UNK STOP
START they then point out that with our present lack of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall of UNK , it is UNK that a planned UNK could be initiated STOP
START they argue further ( and somewhat UNK ) that our knowledge and resources in preventive medicine would make it possible to control such an UNK of disease STOP
START this is why this approach to UNK defense has not been given major attention STOP
START our major problem is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target STOP
START this , of course , does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease STOP
START a UNK example will illustrate this point STOP
START let us assume that it would be possible for an enemy to create an UNK of the UNK agent of epidemic UNK ( UNK UNK ) over city a and that a large number of cases of UNK fever resulted UNK STOP
START no epidemic was initiated nor was one expected because the population in city a was not UNK STOP
START UNK is a UNK for epidemic UNK STOP
START in this case , then , the military objective was accomplished with an epidemic agent solely through the results UNK in the initial attack STOP
START this was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic STOP
START on the other hand , a similar attack might have been made on city b whose population was known to be UNK STOP
START one might expect some spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness of the attack STOP
START the major UNK problems are concerned with the possibility of UNK military delivery of biological agents from appropriate UNK devices STOP
START it should be no more difficult to deliver such devices than other weapons STOP
START the same delivery vehicles -- whether they be UNK , submarines or guided missiles -- should be UNK STOP
START if it is possible for an enemy to put an atomic UNK on a city , it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent over that city STOP
START biological agents are , moreover , suitable for delivery through enemy UNK which UNK many problems in defense STOP
START a few obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned STOP
START the air conditioning and UNK systems of large buildings are subject to attack STOP
START america is rapidly becoming a nation that uses processed , UNK and even UNK foods STOP
START this is an enormous industry that is subject to UNK STOP
START one must include the preparation of soft UNK and the processing of milk and milk products STOP
START huge industries are involved also in the production of biological products , drugs and UNK which are UNK to this type of attack STOP
START a variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group UNK STOP
START these include UNK UNK ( UNK ) UNK , UNK , UNK and column UNK on UNK exchange UNK STOP
START UNK of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators STOP
START UNK and UNK , using a UNK UNK scheme , UNK whole sera containing UNK and UNK UNK on UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START UNK and UNK , in a similar study of blood group UNK of whole sera , used a series of UNK for UNK from aj STOP
START UNK and UNK used a single , continuous gradient at constant UNK for the UNK of UNK and UNK UNK from UNK UNK samples STOP
START in the present work whole sera have been UNK by UNK on UNK using single UNK similar to those described by UNK and UNK , and certain chemical and UNK properties of the fractions containing UNK of the UNK and UNK systems have been described STOP
START materials and methods STOP
START samples STOP
START serum samples were obtained from normal group a , group b and group o UNK STOP
START three of the UNK sera used were taken from recently UNK individuals STOP
START one contained complete antibody and had a UNK of 1 : UNK in saline STOP
START the second contained incomplete antibody and showed UNK of 1 : UNK in UNK and 1 : UNK by the indirect UNK test STOP
START the third , containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete UNK , had UNK of 1 : UNK in saline , 1 : UNK in UNK and 1 : UNK by the indirect UNK test STOP
START in addition one serum was obtained from a UNK ( UNK who had been UNK 6 years previously STOP
START this serum UNK UNK of 1 : 16 in UNK and 1 : UNK by the indirect UNK test STOP
START these antibody UNK were determined by reaction with UNK af red cells STOP
START UNK technique STOP
START UNK and UNK activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group a , group b or group o UNK by the following tube UNK methods STOP
START one drop of each sample was added to one drop of a UNK UNK of group af or group b red cells in a small af test tube STOP
START in several instances group o cells were also used as controls STOP
START the red cells were used within 2 days after UNK and were washed with large amounts of saline before use STOP
START the UNK of sample plus cell UNK were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 aj STOP
START the tubes were then UNK at UNK UNK for 1 UNK and examined UNK for UNK STOP
START for the UNK method , equal volumes of UNK UNK UNK , sample and UNK cells suspended in saline were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 UNK and then were UNK at UNK UNK for 1 aj STOP
START all samples were tested by both the saline and UNK methods STOP
START the activities of fractions of sera containing UNK UNK were tested by the saline , UNK and indirect UNK techniques STOP
START UNK and UNK af cells , af and UNK and UNK af cells were used to test each sample ; ; STOP
START however , in the interest of clarity and UNK only the results obtained with UNK af and UNK af cells will be presented here STOP
START the saline and UNK tests were performed as described for the UNK samples except that the mixture was UNK for 1 UNK at UNK before UNK STOP
START the saline tubes were saved and used for the indirect UNK test in the following manner STOP
START the cells were washed three times with saline , UNK serum was added , the cells were UNK , and the mixture was UNK at UNK UNK for 1 UNK and examined for UNK STOP
START the UNK sera used were prepared by UNK whole human serum into UNK STOP
START those UNK shown by UNK to be of the `` broad spectrum '' type were selected for use in the present study STOP
START the red cells for the UNK antibody tests were used within 3 days after drawing except for the af cells , which had been UNK and stored at UNK for approximately 1 year STOP
START these cells were UNK at UNK for 30 UNK and were UNK by UNK UNK and UNK with UNK UNK of UNK solutions ( 20 , 18 , 10 , 8 , 4 and UNK ) STOP
START the cells were then washed three times with saline and UNK to UNK in saline STOP
START UNK STOP
START blood samples were allowed to UNK at room temperature for 3 UNK , UNK and the serum was removed STOP
START the serum was measured UNK and UNK UNK in the cold for at least 24 UNK against three to four changes , approximately UNK ml each , of `` starting buffer '' STOP
START this buffer , UNK UNK , was UNK m in af and UNK m in UNK ( UNK ) STOP
START after dialysis the sample was UNK and the UNK placed on a af cm column of UNK UNK with starting buffer STOP
START the UNK , containing UNK UNK of n , was prepared in our laboratory by the method of UNK and UNK ( 7 ) from UNK UNK , 100 - UNK UNK STOP
START the small amount of UNK material which UNK during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ml of starting buffer , UNK , UNK in UNK ml of UNK saline and tested for antibody activity STOP
START the UNK was done at UNK using gradient UNK , essentially according to UNK and UNK STOP
START the deep UNK gradient employed ( UNK ) was obtained with a UNK gradient UNK device ( `` UNK '' , reference ( 8 ) ) and has been described elsewhere STOP
START the other , a UNK UNK gradient ( fig1 ) , was produced with a so-called `` UNK '' apparatus , the `` cone '' being a UNK UNK UNK and the `` sphere , '' a UNK UNK UNK STOP
START each initially contained UNK ml of buffer ; ; STOP
START in the sphere was starting buffer and in the cone was final buffer , UNK m in both af and UNK , UNK UNK STOP
START a flow rate of UNK af was used and 12 ml fractions were collected STOP
START approximately UNK fractions were obtained from each column STOP
START these were read at UNK UNK in a UNK model du UNK and tested for antibody activity as described above STOP
START paper UNK STOP
START for protein identification , fractions from the column were concentrated by UNK against a stream of air at UNK or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted UNK concentration of the protein and dialysis against UNK saline STOP
START during the latter procedure the temperature was maintained at UNK by surrounding the apparatus with ice STOP
START because negative pressure dialysis gave better recovery of proteins , permitted detection of proteins concentrated from very UNK solutions and was a UNK procedure , it was used in all but the earliest experiments STOP
START paper UNK was carried out on the concentrated samples in a UNK model r cell using UNK buffer , UNK UNK , UNK strength UNK , at room temperature on UNK UNK UNK paper STOP
START five UNK were applied for 18 UNK , after which the strips were stained with UNK blue and UNK was carried out using a UNK UNK STOP
START when paper UNK was to be used for preparation , eight strips of a whole serum sample or a UNK fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were run under the conditions described above STOP
START at the end of the run , the strips in the third and sixth positions in each chamber were dried , stained for 1 UNK , washed and dried , while the other strips were maintained in a UNK position at UNK STOP
START the UNK strips were then marked , using the stained ones as a guide , and cut UNK so as to separate the various protein UNK STOP
START the strip sections containing a given protein were UNK , UNK with UNK ml of UNK saline , and the UNK were tested for antibody activity STOP
START UNK STOP
START fractions from the column which were to be subjected to UNK UNK were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis and UNK for 16 UNK in the cold against at least UNK volumes of UNK saline , UNK UNK , UNK strength UNK STOP
START they were then UNK at UNK UNK for UNK to UNK UNK at UNK in a UNK model e UNK at a protein concentration of UNK to UNK STOP
START UNK UNK were computed as af values and relative amounts of the various components were calculated from the UNK patterns STOP
START for UNK UNK , fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis to volumes of 1 ml or less , transferred to UNK tubes and UNK to 12 ml with UNK saline STOP
START UNK was then carried out in a UNK model l UNK at UNK UNK for UNK to UNK UNK , refrigeration being used throughout the run STOP
START UNK UNK fractions were then drawn off with a UNK UNK , starting at the top of the tube , and tested for UNK activity STOP
START other methods will be described below STOP
START experimental and results STOP
START the UNK material which UNK during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense UNK activity , regardless of the blood group of the UNK STOP
START with either of the UNK described , UNK on UNK separated UNK of the UNK series into at least three regions ( UNK and 2 ) : one of extremely low UNK binding capacity , one of low UNK binding capacity and one of high UNK binding capacity STOP
START these have been UNK regions 1 , 2 , and 4 , respectively , in fig1 STOP
START when the early part of the gradient was UNK , either by using the gradient shown in UNK or by allowing the `` UNK '' gradient to become established more slowly , region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas ( UNK UNK UNK fig1 and UNK UNK ) STOP
START the latter procedure gave rise to a small active protein peak ( region UNK ) between regions 1 and 2 STOP
START in 2 of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of UNK activity with intermediate UNK binding capacity was detected ( region 3 , fig1 ) STOP
START moreover , after concentration using negative pressure dialysis , UNK activity could sometimes be detected in the region designated UNK ( UNK UNK UNK and UNK fig1 ) STOP
START not all these regions UNK equal UNK activity , as evidenced by UNK and the extent of the active areas STOP
START in all cases , most of the activity lay in the region of high UNK binding capacity STOP
START this was particularly UNK in group a and group b sera , in which cases activity in regions 1 and 2 was usually not UNK without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detected at all STOP
START there appeared to be no difference in the distribution of UNK and UNK activity in group o serum , though in two group o UNK ( UNK UNK only one type of UNK was found in the regions of low UNK binding capacity ( UNK and 2 ) STOP
START several samples of UNK plasma were UNK in our laboratory by method 6 of UNK et UNK STOP
START these fractions were tested for UNK UNK activity , using fractions from group UNK plasma as a control STOP
START as expected , most of the activity was found in fraction af , with slight activity seen in fraction UNK STOP
START a sample of fraction af from group o plasma was dissolved in starting buffer , UNK against this buffer and subjected to UNK using the gradient shown in UNK STOP
START once again , both UNK and UNK activities were found in the UNK material UNK during dialysis STOP
START similarly , both types of UNK were found in three regions of the UNK UNK , having extremely low , low , and high UNK binding capacity , respectively ( UNK ) STOP
START UNK of whole sera revealed that the areas of UNK antibody activity were generally continuous and wide STOP
START the incomplete antibody activity appeared in the early part of the UNK ; ; STOP
START the complete , in the latter part STOP
START the serum containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete UNK showed activity in both regions ( fig1 ) STOP
START in all cases the activity against af cells was spread over a wider area than that with af cells , regardless of the type of test ( saline , UNK , indirect UNK ) used for comparison STOP
START the UNK material resulting from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity STOP
START in fact UNK of af cells in saline could be produced by the UNK material from sera containing `` only '' incomplete antibody activity STOP
START this was later known to be the result of UNK the minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera ; ; STOP
START when the UNK fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal to that of the original serum sample , no complete antibody activity could be detected STOP
START apart from the UNK , practically all bees and UNK UNK in a state of UNK STOP
START occasionally , you may come across one or two UNK in the cold season , when you are turning over UNK in your garden , but you have to be a really UNK observer to see them at all STOP
START they keep their wings and feet pressed UNK against their bodies , and in spite of their often colorful UNK you may very well mistake them for UNK of dirt STOP
START i must add at once that these animals are what we call `` UNK '' , young females that have UNK in the previous summer or UNK STOP
START it is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , UNK , brothers , and UNK UNK ) have UNK with the arrival of the cold weather STOP
START even some of the UNK will die before the winter is over , falling UNK to enemies or disease STOP
START the UNK emerge on some UNK , UNK day in march or april , when the temperature is close to UNK and there is not too much wind STOP
START now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful UNK UNK such as the red UNK UNK of our pacific northwest , or otherwise a good UNK tree , or perhaps some UNK UNK UNK in UNK , preferably one with male or UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK of UNK and of the UNK and UNK are the places where large numbers of our early insects will UNK : UNK , UNK , and other wild bees , and also various kinds of UNK STOP
START it is a happy , UNK crowd STOP
START each male UNK UNK is composed of a large number of small flowers STOP
START it is not difficult to see that the UNK of the UNK are always arranged in pairs , and that each individual UNK is nothing but one such pair standing on a green , UNK little scale STOP
START by UNK the flowers , one can also notice that the scale bears one or two tiny UNK STOP
START those are the UNK or UNK UNK ( UNK , page UNK ) STOP
START the UNK UNK UNK , then , provide their visitors with both UNK and UNK ; ; STOP
START a UNK arrangement , for it provides exactly what the UNK UNK need to make their UNK , a combination of UNK and UNK with which the young of all species are fed STOP
START the only exception to this is certain bees that have become UNK STOP
START i will deal with these later on STOP
START quite often , UNK form a majority on the UNK UNK STOP
START as we have already seen in the first chapter , UNK are bigger , UNK , and much more colorful than UNK , UNK various combinations of black , yellow , white and UNK STOP
START let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game , and let us just call them UNK STOP
START there must be several dozen species in the united states alone STOP
START if you really insist on knowing their names , an excellent book on the north american species is UNK and their ways by UNK STOP
START if we manage to keep track of a UNK queen after she has left her feeding place , we may discover the UNK little UNK which she has fixed up for herself when she UNK up from her winter sleep STOP
START as UNK a queen , a UNK female is rather UNK and may spend considerable time UNK for a suitable UNK place STOP
START most species seem to prefer a UNK UNK such as a UNK UNK UNK , a bird house , or the hole made by a UNK ; ; STOP
START some show a definite UNK for making their UNK in UNK STOP
START once she has made up her mind , the queen starts out by UNK , in her chosen UNK , a small `` floor '' of dried grass or some UNK material STOP
START on this , she UNK an `` egg UNK '' or `` egg cell '' which is filled with that famous UNK mixture called UNK STOP
START she also UNK one or two UNK UNK which she UNK with UNK STOP
START then , a group of eggs is UNK in a UNK in the UNK UNK and the egg UNK is closed STOP
START the queen UNK UNK UNK and UNK her eggs like a mother UNK , taking a UNK from time to time from the rather liquid UNK in her UNK UNK STOP
START when the UNK UNK , they feed on the UNK , although they also receive extra UNK meals from their mother STOP
START she continues to add to the UNK supply as needed STOP
START the UNK , kept warm by the queen , are full grown in about ten days STOP
START each now makes a tough , UNK UNK and UNK STOP
START after another two weeks , the first young emerge , four to eight small UNK that begin to play the role of worker bees , UNK UNK and UNK in the field and UNK for the new young generation while the queen UNK to a life of egg UNK STOP
START the first worker bees do not mate or lay eggs ; ; STOP
START males and UNK females do not emerge until later in the season STOP
START the UNK of workers that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones , probably because they are better fed STOP
START by the middle of the summer , many of the UNK apparently receive such a good diet that it is `` optimal '' , and it is then that young UNK begin to appear STOP
START simultaneously , males or UNK are produced , mostly from the UNK eggs of workers , although a few may be produced by the queen STOP
START the young UNK and UNK leave the UNK and mate , and after a short period of freedom , the UNK young UNK will begin to UNK in for the winter STOP
START it is an amazing fact that in some species this will happen while the summer is still in full UNK , for instance , in august STOP
START the temperature then is still very high STOP
START at the old UNK , the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the UNK eggs that will produce females STOP
START as a result , the proportion of males ( which leave the UNK ) increases , and eventually the old colony will die out completely STOP
START the UNK itself , the structure that in some cases UNK about UNK individuals when the season was at its peak , is now rapidly destroyed by the UNK UNK of certain UNK and UNK STOP
START not always , though , does the development of a UNK colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just described STOP
START some members of the UNK family have become UNK , social UNK that live at the expense of their UNK relatives STOP
START UNK can thus suffer severely from the UNK of UNK , the `` UNK '' as it is called in some european countries STOP
START female individuals of UNK look UNK like the workers and UNK of the UNK they UNK STOP
START the one sure way to tell victim and UNK apart is to examine the UNK legs which in the case of the UNK , UNK , lack the UNK UNK -- naturally ! ! STOP
START the female UNK UNK much time in her efforts to find a UNK of her host STOP
START when she UNK , she usually UNK to slip in UNK , to UNK an egg on a completed UNK of UNK before the UNK seal the egg UNK STOP
START the UNK never seem to recognize that something is UNK , so that the UNK UNK is sealed normally STOP
START thus , the UNK of the UNK can develop at the expense of the UNK UNK and the store of UNK STOP
START later on , they and the mother UNK are fed by the UNK workers STOP
START worse still , in a number of cases it has been claimed that the UNK female UNK the UNK queen STOP
START but let us return , after this UNK UNK , to our UNK UNK in the spring ; ; STOP
START there are other wild bees that command our attention STOP
START it is almost certain that some of these , usually a UNK smaller than the UNK , are UNK or UNK bees STOP
START there are about 200 different kinds of UNK in europe alone STOP
START one of my UNK is UNK , a species very common in england , where it is sometimes referred to as the UNK UNK STOP
START the females like to UNK in the short UNK of UNK UNK , where their little UNK of earth often appear by the hundreds STOP
START almost equal in size to a UNK , UNK is much more beautiful in color , at least in the female of the species : a rich , UNK , UNK red STOP
START the males are much UNK STOP
START after having UNK , an UNK female UNK a hole straight down into the ground , forming a UNK about the size of a lead pencil STOP
START the bottom part of a UNK has a number of side UNK or `` cells '' , each of which is provided with an egg plus a store of UNK STOP
START the development of the UNK UNK is very rapid , so that by the end of spring they have already UNK and become adults STOP
START but they are still UNK in their UNK cells and remain there throughout the summer , fall , and winter STOP
START their appearance , next spring , UNK in an almost UNK way with the UNK of their host plants STOP
START in the UNK valley in california , for instance , it has been observed that there was not one UNK difference between the UNK of the UNK and the opening of the UNK UNK STOP
START this must be due to a completely identical response to the weather , in the plant and the animal STOP
START after the male and female UNK have UNK , the cycle is repeated STOP
START although UNK is UNK , so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of UNK together , we must still call it a UNK UNK STOP
START its life history is much simpler than that of the truly colonial UNK and can serve as an example of the life cycle of many other species STOP
START after all , social life in the group of the bees is by no means general , although it certainly is a striking feature STOP
START on the basis of its life history , we like to think that UNK is more primitive than the UNK STOP
START the way in which it UNK its UNK is not so perfect , either STOP
START it UNK UNK UNK and UNK only a large number of long , UNK UNK on its legs , on which the UNK grains will UNK STOP
START still UNK will do a reasonably good job , so that an animal with a full UNK load looks like a gay little piece of yellow down UNK in the wind STOP
START closely related to the UNK are the UNK or UNK bees STOP
START UNK UNK can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the united states west of the great UNK , for example , in UNK and central washington STOP
START in the united states department of UNK UNK of agriculture , 1952 , which is devoted entirely to insects , george UNK UNK a site in UNK which was estimated to contain UNK UNK females STOP
START often the UNK are only an inch or two apart , and the UNK cities cover several acres STOP
START the life history of the UNK UNK is similar to that of UNK , but the first activity of the adults does not take place until summer , and the individuals UNK in the UNK stage STOP
START in most places , there are two UNK a year , a second UNK of adults UNK late in the summer STOP
START i must UNK guilty to a special sympathy for UNK STOP
START this may just be pride in my adopted state of washington , but certainly i love to visit their UNK cities near UNK and UNK in july or august , when the bees are in their most active period STOP
START the name `` UNK UNK '' indicates that one has to look for them in rather UNK places STOP
START sometimes , although by no means always , these are indeed UNK STOP
START the thing is that these bees love a UNK soil that is UNK ; ; STOP
START yet the water in the ground should not be UNK either STOP
START they UNK UNK UNK STOP
START where does one find such conditions ? ? STOP
START the best chance , of course , is offered by gently UNK UNK where the water remains close to the surface and where the air is dry , so that a high UNK leaves UNK UNK which permit only UNK plant growth STOP
START many other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length STOP
START UNK UNK put length at maturity at two UNK the ultimate length for some UNK , and charles UNK data on michigan UNK and UNK snakes ( UNK ) show that the UNK UNK females are more than half as long as the UNK adults STOP
START UNK UNK states that `` when the UNK reaches its maturity it has already reached about its UNK length '' , but goes on to UNK the UNK python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity STOP
START it is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow UNK after UNK maturity ; ; STOP
START he was working with species of UNK , so perhaps some UNK snakes are unusual in this respect STOP
START certain individual UNK recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to UNK conditions STOP
START additional records of slow growth have been UNK STOP
START it is possible to make a few UNK about the six UNK themselves STOP
START there seems to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths , starting with the UNK ( UNK UNK ) and ending with the largest ( anaconda ) STOP
START data on the former are UNK , but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others , thereby UNK support to the belief that the anaconda does , indeed , attain the greatest length STOP
START for four of the six ( the anaconda and the UNK python cannot be included for lack of data ) there is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length , the UNK UNK being the UNK and the indian python the next in size at the former stage STOP
START let us UNK a little on the maximum size of the anaconda STOP
START if , in a certain part of the range , it starts life 1 foot longer than do any of the other ( relatively large ) UNK , and reaches maturity at , let us UNK , 18 inches longer than the others , a UNK of the maturity length would result in a maximum of ( nearly ) 40 feet STOP
START when it comes to rate of early growth , the indian python leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches per year for the first two years , more or less STOP
START the african rock python , a close second , is followed in turn by the UNK python STOP
START there are few data on the UNK UNK , those for the anaconda are UNK , and there is nothing at all on the UNK python STOP
START it seems likely that the indian python comes out ahead because records of its growth have been made more carefully and frequently ; ; STOP
START it UNK UNK well to UNK and does not reach proportions that make it hard to keep STOP
START i cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity growth ; ; STOP
START at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches rather than feet STOP
START until better records have been kept over longer periods of time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions , it will be wise to UNK from drawing conclusions STOP
START it is often stated that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity , but this apparently is an UNK STOP
START the best way to determine the correct figure ( in UNK ) is by direct observation of pairs isolated from birth , a method that produced surprising results : UNK of a male indian python in less than two years , his mate in less than three ; ; STOP
START data on the UNK UNK about match this STOP
START another approach is to estimate from the rate of growth and the UNK size at maturity STOP
START results from this approach UNK confirm the direct observations : about three years are required , there being a possible slight difference between males and females in the time required STOP
START only the UNK python and the anaconda must be UNK for lack or UNK of data STOP
START the following information on snakes varying greatly in size ( but all with less than a UNK maximum ) shows , when considered with the UNK , that there is probably no correlation between the length of a UNK and the time required for it to mature STOP
START UNK , in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the united states , could supply data on the UNK period for only three species in addition to the UNK , which i shall consider UNK STOP
START these three were much alike : UNK UNK ( UNK ) , one year and nine months ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK ( UNK ) , two years ; ; STOP
START UNK ( UNK ) , two years STOP
START UNK investigated the UNK carefully himself and also UNK what others have found STOP
START he concluded that in the southern species , which are rapidly growing types , females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young when they are three STOP
START other UNK have UNK that in the northern united states the UNK UNK may not give first birth until it is four or even five years old , and that the young may be born every other year , rather than UNK STOP
START UNK study showed that female common UNK and UNK snakes of michigan mature at about the age of two STOP
START maximum length STOP
START UNK UNK are never brought home either alive or preserved , and field measurements are obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to UNK dimensions STOP
START measurements of UNK are of little value ; ; STOP
START every UNK UNK is UNK longer than its UNK and UNK UNK presents no difficulty to the UNK UNK STOP
START in spite of all the UNK , there is a certain amount of agreement on some of the UNK STOP
START the anaconda UNK to be the fly in the UNK , but the reason for this is not clear ; ; STOP
START the relatively wild conditions still found in UNK south america might be responsible STOP
START there are three levels on which to treat the subject STOP
START the first is the strictly scientific , which demands concrete proof and therefore may UNK on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in the flesh STOP
START this approach UNK virtually all field measurements STOP
START the next level attempts to UNK varied evidence and come to a balanced , UNK conclusion ; ; STOP
START field measurements by experienced UNK are not rejected , and even reports of a less scientific nature are UNK evaluated STOP
START the third level UNK on a belief that a lot of smoke means some fire STOP
START the argument against this last approach is comparable to that which UNK stories about UNK snakes , about snakes that break themselves into many pieces and join up again , or even of UNK that UNK people out of UNK ; ; STOP
START the mere UNK up of testimony does not prove , to the scientific mind , the existence of UNK snakes , joint snakes , or UNK STOP
START UNK has recently used the UNK approach with the largest snakes , and has come to these conclusions : the anaconda reaches a length of at least UNK feet , the UNK python UNK , the african rock python 25 , the UNK python at least 22 , the indian python 20 , and the UNK UNK UNK STOP
START UNK UNK also UNK of the largest snakes , but on the third level , and is chiefly concerned with the anaconda STOP
START he reasons that as UNK 30 feet long are often found , some might be UNK , and occasional `` UNK UNK '' over 50 STOP
START he UNK dimensions of 70 feet and more STOP
START his UNK chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge UNK with UNK strength , but these seem to be given to complete his picture , not to be believed STOP
START detailed information on record lengths of the UNK is given in the section that follows STOP
START growth of the six UNK STOP
START discussions of the UNK one by one will include , as far as possible , data on these aspects of growth : size at which life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached ; ; STOP
START time required to reach maturity ; ; STOP

START definite information on the growth of UNK individuals is lacking STOP
START anaconda : STOP
START at birth , this species UNK considerably in size STOP
START a UNK of UNK born at UNK UNK , near chicago , ranged in length from 22 to UNK inches and averaged 29 inches STOP
START UNK UNK gives measurements of nineteen young UNK , presumably members of a UNK , from `` south america '' ; ; STOP
START the extreme measurements of these fall between the lower limit of the UNK UNK and its average STOP
START UNK UNK had two UNK that averaged 27 inches STOP
START UNK and UNK give approximately 20 inches as the average length of a UNK of thirty from the region of the UNK UNK STOP
START william UNK reports 26 inches and UNK UNK ( this UNK must have been UNK ) for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from british UNK STOP
START in contrast , UNK recorded the average length of UNK young of a UNK female as UNK inches , and four young were born in london at a length of UNK or UNK inches and a weight of from 14 to 16 UNK STOP
START UNK had a UNK anaconda that weighed only UNK UNK STOP
START a difference between UNK might explain the great range in size STOP
START i have little information on the UNK rate of growth STOP
START UNK UNK had one that increased from UNK inches to 5 feet 3 inches in five years , and UNK records a growth of from less than 4 feet to nearly 10 in about six years STOP
START it is very UNK that either of these UNK was growing at a normal rate STOP
START in 1948 , UNK do UNK , the noted UNK UNK , wrote a technical paper on the UNK snakes STOP
START he concluded that the UNK maximum length is 12 or 13 ( perhaps 14 ) meters , which would approximate from UNK to UNK feet ( 14 meters is slightly less than UNK feet ) STOP
START thus , his estimate lies between UNK suggestion of at least UNK feet and the UNK `` UNK UNK '' UNK by UNK STOP
START the most UNK recent measurement of an anaconda was made in eastern UNK by UNK UNK , a UNK UNK of the UNK oil company , and reported in UNK by UNK UNK STOP
START however , as a field measurement , it is open to question STOP
START UNK UNK feet is partly based on this report and can be accepted as probable STOP
START however , many UNK remain UNK and would prefer a UNK maximum of about 30 feet STOP
START it is possible that especially large UNK will prove to belong to UNK limited to a small area STOP
START in snakes difference in size is a common characteristic of UNK STOP
START UNK UNK : STOP
START a UNK UNK UNK of sixteen UNK UNK born in the UNK island UNK averaged 20 inches STOP
START this birth length seems to be typical STOP
START when some UNK records of newly and recently born individuals are UNK , little or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected STOP
START the range is from 14 to 25 inches ; ; STOP
START the former figure is based on a somewhat unusual birth of four by a central american female ( see chapter on UNK , UNK , UNK , and birth ) , the latter on a `` normal '' newly born individual STOP
START however , as so many of the records are not certainly based on UNK snakes , these data must be taken UNK ; ; STOP
START final conclusions will have to UNK the measurements of UNK from definite UNK STOP
START UNK UNK measurements of several very young specimens from UNK suggest that at birth the female is slightly larger than the male STOP
START i have surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity STOP
START carl UNK has written to me of sexual activity in february 1943 of young born in march 1940 STOP
START one female , collected on an island off the coast of UNK , was UNK and measured 4 feet 8 inches from UNK to UNK ( her tail should be between 6 and 7 inches long ) STOP
START the female from central america which gave birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches long STOP
START what data there are on growth indicate considerable variation in rate ; ; STOP
START unfortunately , no one has kept complete records of one individual , whereas many have been made for a very short period of time STOP
START the results are too varied to allow UNK STOP
START the UNK and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout STOP
START the pulmonary vein , however , without the UNK UNK tissue UNK as in type 1 , , follows a more direct path to the UNK and does not maintain this close relationship ( UNK , 22 ) STOP
START another marked difference is noted here STOP
START the pulmonary artery , in addition to supplying the UNK portion of the respiratory UNK , the UNK UNK , and the UNK , continues on and directly supplies the thin UNK ( UNK ) STOP
START the bronchial artery , except for a small number of short branches in the UNK , UNK none of the UNK blood supply STOP
START it does , as in type 1 , , supply the UNK UNK UNK , the pulmonary artery , the pulmonary vein , the UNK , and the UNK -- UNK in a common UNK bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory UNK STOP
START no bronchial UNK artery UNK were noted in this group STOP
START lung type 3 ( ( UNK ) is to some degree a UNK of types 1 , and 2 STOP
START it is characterized by the presence of UNK developed secondary UNK ; ; STOP
START well defined , but UNK arranged , UNK UNK and a thick , remarkably UNK UNK ( UNK ) STOP
START the most UNK UNK are similar to those found in type 1 , , being composed of numerous , apparently true UNK UNK and occasional , UNK developed respiratory UNK ( UNK , 15 ) STOP
START in this instance , because of incomplete UNK , the secondary UNK does not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung as in type 1 STOP
START UNK from one area to another are , therefore , UNK STOP
START UNK the UNK is situated between a pulmonary artery on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other , as in type 1 ( ( UNK ) STOP
START this relationship , however , is not maintained UNK STOP
START here the pulmonary vein , as in type 2 , , is noted to draw away from the UNK , and to follow a more direct , independent course to the UNK ( UNK , 24 ) STOP
START the bronchial artery in its course and distribution UNK somewhat from that found in other UNK STOP
START as seen in types 1 , and 2 , , it supplies the UNK UNK UNK , UNK UNK to the pulmonary artery and vein , the UNK and the UNK UNK STOP
START as in type 1 , , it provides UNK blood to the UNK UNK , and an extremely rich UNK UNK supply is seen ( UNK , 10 ) STOP
START this UNK supply is derived both from UNK and UNK bronchial artery branches STOP
START such a UNK UNK was UNK demonstrated during the UNK process where initial filling would be noted to occur in several isolated UNK vessels at once STOP
START some of these were obviously filling from UNK branches of the bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct UNK branches following along the UNK surface STOP
START with completion of filling , UNK UNK were noted to be present between these UNK derived branches STOP
START an unusual increase in the number of bronchial arteries present within the substance of the lung was noted STOP
START this was UNK for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following the pulmonary artery STOP
START the diameter of this bronchial artery was much too large for it to be a mere UNK UNK ( UNK , 23 , 24 ) STOP
START in UNK regions its diameter would be UNK to UNK that of the pulmonary artery STOP
START this UNK could be followed to the UNK where it directly provided bronchial UNK blood to the UNK UNK bed ( UNK , 18 ) STOP
START also three other direct UNK of UNK bronchial UNK supply were noted : via the UNK ; ; STOP
START through the UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START and along the UNK UNK ( UNK , 17 , 18 , 19 ) STOP
START one bronchial UNK UNK UNK was noted at the UNK UNK level ( UNK ) STOP
START discussion STOP
START it is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an UNK comparison is made STOP
START the significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding UNK differences been determined STOP
START however , the UNK of UNK , from UNK considerations alone , may UNK be different in the UNK than in the horse STOP
START the volume and , perhaps , even the characteristics of bronchial UNK blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse STOP
START also , UNK air UNK may be all but UNK in the cow ; ; STOP
START probably occur in the horse much as in the human being ; ; STOP
START and , in contrast , are present to a relatively UNK degree on a UNK basis in the dog where UNK are absent ( van UNK and UNK , UNK ) STOP
START a reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary UNK is entirely lacking at present STOP
START within certain wide limits UNK UNK function and , if one is permitted to UNK , potential pathology should be included in this statement as well STOP
START for example , the marked UNK of the UNK to respiratory UNK might be related to its UNK , long UNK UNK and short , large UNK situated within a UNK entirely lacking in UNK UNK tissue UNK such as those found in types 1 , and 3 STOP
START one might also wonder if UNK are capable of developing UNK as we know it in man or the horse STOP
START in addition , it would be difficult to imagine UNK UNK UNK occurring in a cow , considering its marked UNK development but , UNK , not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog STOP
START UNK , the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man , UNK as this can be UNK from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of others ( UNK , UNK ) in the human being STOP
START the only area in which one might find major UNK in this matter is in regard to the UNK distribution of the bronchial arteries STOP
START as early as UNK , UNK fort claimed an UNK distribution of the bronchial arteries in human beings STOP
START in 1951 , this was UNK by UNK STOP
START the opposition to this point of view has its UNK support in the work of miller ( UNK ) STOP
START apparently , however , miller has UNK heavily on the UNK in dogs and UNK , and he has been UNK for using UNK human material in his normal study ( UNK , UNK ) STOP
START although miller noted in UNK that a difference in the UNK blood supply existed between animals , nowhere in his published works is it found that he did a comparative study of the UNK features of various UNK lungs other than in the dog and UNK ( miller , UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK ) STOP
START the meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial artery as found in the horse is not clear STOP
START however , this artery is known to be a UNK UNK with a distribution primarily to the UNK UNK and UNK UNK of the lung STOP
START the UNK and respiratory UNK are primarily UNK UNK STOP
START UNK , they are capable of UNK their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ( UNK and UNK , UNK ) or from pulmonary UNK blood ( UNK , UNK ) STOP
START therefore , an explanation of this UNK bronchial artery supply might be the UNK requirement of an increased amount of UNK tissue , not primarily UNK in nature , in the region of the UNK STOP
START if this be true , the possibility exists that an UNK UNK of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread UNK of UNK tissue similar to that seen in UNK UNK STOP
START one would not expect such an event to occur in animals UNK lungs of types 1 , or 2 STOP
START the presence of normally occurring bronchial UNK artery UNK was first noted in UNK by UNK , and thereafter by many others STOP
START UNK ( UNK ) , UNK ( UNK ) , UNK , UNK and watson ( UNK ) , UNK UNK ( UNK ) , and UNK ( UNK ) have all claimed their normal but relatively UNK existence in the human being STOP
START miller ( UNK ) is the principal UNK of this viewpoint STOP
START in criticism of the UNK views , his conclusions were based upon dog lung UNK studies in which all of the UNK channels were first filled with a solution under pressure and then were UNK with various UNK colored particles designed to stop at the UNK level STOP
START as early as UNK UNK and UNK demonstrated with UNK studies in dogs that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein , but that increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary artery pressure STOP
START UNK , UNK and UNK in UNK and UNK in 1958 UNK this STOP
START our own studies in which bronchial UNK artery UNK were demonstrated , were accomplished by UNK the bronchial artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary artery or vein , and then by UNK the pulmonary artery and vein UNK STOP
START it is UNK possible , therefore , that UNK pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the UNK UNK and hence , UNK STOP
START this viewpoint is further supported by UNK ( UNK ) demonstration of UNK bronchial artery and UNK UNK UNK which are capable of acting as UNK STOP
START in other words , the UNK between the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery should be considered as functional or demand UNK STOP
START in addition , little work has been done on a comparative basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial UNK artery UNK STOP
START UNK ( UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK ) found these UNK in the human being but was unable to find them in UNK STOP
START UNK , UNK and UNK ( UNK ) also were unable to find them in UNK STOP
START UNK ( UNK ) was unable to demonstrate their existence , either by UNK or UNK methods , in dogs STOP
START the possibility that the absence or presence of these UNK is UNK is therefore UNK STOP
START certainly , the mere fact of UNK to demonstrate them in one or another species does not UNK deny their existence in that species STOP
START it is , however , highly UNK and UNK well with our own findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial UNK artery UNK in certain species , especially the dog STOP
START in conclusion , these findings suggest the need for a comparative UNK , pathology , and UNK of UNK lungs STOP
START in addition , a detailed UNK survey of the UNK of UNK pulmonary UNK in UNK would be interesting and pertinent STOP
START also , for the present , great caution should be exercised in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to be applied to man STOP
START this is especially so if the dog , UNK or UNK are to be used , in view of their marked UNK differences from man STOP
START finally , it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be UNK more comparable to that of the human than any other presently known species STOP
START summary STOP
START the main UNK UNK features of the lungs of various UNK are presented STOP
START a UNK of these features permits the lungs to be UNK into three distinctive UNK types STOP
START type 1 , is represented by the cow , sheep , and UNK ; ; STOP
START type 2 , , by the dog , UNK , and UNK ; ; STOP
START type 3 , , by the horse STOP
START UNK is extremely well developed in type 1 ; ; STOP
START absent in type 2 ; ; STOP
START UNK developed in type 3 STOP
START the UNK and UNK UNK are thick in types 1 and 3 STOP
START the UNK is extremely thin in type 2 and UNK are absent STOP
START UNK supply to the UNK in types 1 and 3 is provided by the bronchial artery , and in type 2 , by the pulmonary artery STOP
START in types 1 , 2 and 3 the bronchial artery UNK in a UNK bed shared in common with the pulmonary artery at the level of the UNK UNK STOP
START in type 3 the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the UNK UNK bed STOP
START true UNK UNK UNK the most frequent form taken by the UNK UNK in types 1 and 3 , although small numbers of UNK developed respiratory UNK are present STOP
START well developed respiratory UNK , on the other hand , appear to be the only form taken by the UNK UNK in type 2 STOP
START in type 1 the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the UNK and the pulmonary artery from the UNK to the UNK STOP
START this may be due to the heavy UNK UNK tissue UNK present STOP
START in type 3 , this general relationship is maintained UNK but not UNK where the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path to the UNK as is the case throughout the lung in type 2 STOP
START some of the features of the top UNK of figure 1 and figure 2 were mentioned in discussing table 1 STOP
START first , the onset profile UNK across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls STOP
START in contrast , 20 of the 21 lines in the completion profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are UNK and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls STOP
START the maturity chart for each sex UNK clearly that onset is a phenomenon of UNK and early childhood whereas completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence STOP
START second , for both UNK , the 21 UNK lines in the onset profile vary more in individual spread than those in the completion profile STOP
START although the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to UNK early ( table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely UNK UNK STOP
START third , the process of UNK is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which UNK data for other groups of children STOP
START the onset profile and completion profile are constructed to serve as norms for children STOP
START it is convenient to UNK a child's onset ages and completion ages as `` advanced '' , `` moderate '' ( UNK ) , or `` delayed '' according to whether the child's age equivalent `` UNK '' appeared to the left of , upon , or to the right of the appropriate short UNK line STOP
START when a UNK appears close to the end of the UNK line , the `` moderate '' UNK may be further classified according to the position of the UNK with respect to the vertical UNK UNK the mean age STOP
START such UNK may be called `` somewhat advanced '' or `` somewhat delayed '' , as the case may be , UNK `` moderate '' for UNK upon or close to the mean STOP
START in the lower portion of each chart , the skeletal age ( hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified STOP
START there the middle one of the three curves UNK `` mean skeletal age '' for the maturity series boys and girls STOP
START the upper curve UNK the mean plus one standard deviation , and the lower curve represents the mean UNK one standard deviation STOP
START thus , a child's skeletal age `` UNK '' may be classified as `` advanced '' when they appear above the middle curve , `` moderate '' when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve , and `` delayed '' when they appear below the lower curve STOP
START to UNK the purpose of the skeletal maturity chart : each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which show two quite different methods of UNK UNK level of growth centers STOP
START first , the upper portion requires series of films for every child , consisting of those from hand , UNK , shoulder , UNK , and foot STOP
START the lower portion UNK only films of hand STOP
START second , the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long , short , and round bones of the five regions STOP
START the lower portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round bones UNK , since only two long bones are included in hand and UNK as a region STOP
START third , the upper portion deals with only two UNK of UNK level , onset and completion STOP
START the lower portion UNK the full complement of intermediate maturity UNK of each hand center as well as their onset and completion STOP
START fourth , the two UNK are for the most part widely separated UNK , with the extensive age gap occurring during childhood for all but one growth center STOP
START the lower portion provides a UNK at any stage between UNK and UNK STOP
START UNK , UNK , and skeletal ages ( hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified , using only those skeletal ages which appear immediately below the onset profile and the completion profile STOP
START it may be assumed that differences in UNK due to selection of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small , according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body STOP
START accordingly , maturity level UNK by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since skeletal age UNK are dependent upon UNK during UNK and upon UNK during adolescence STOP
START it is clear that there are some differences in the UNK , but there is substantial agreement STOP
START since a skeletal age UNK can be made at any age during growth , from UNK , shoulder , UNK , or foot as well as hand , it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal UNK progress during childhood STOP
START as stated earlier in the paper , UNK and UNK -- particularly the former -- provide a different tool or UNK of UNK in UNK development , each within a limited age period STOP
START such an UNK , or UNK , are needed as means of UNK specific periods of delay in skeletal UNK progress STOP
START it was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of UNK of onset and completion in each of the 21 growth centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in tables 1 and 2 STOP
START as one approach to doing this , figures 3 and 4 have be constructed from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2 STOP
START the differences between onset age and completion age with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into UNK by means of a series of UNK STOP
START the data for boy 34 appear in figure 3 , and for girl 2 in figure 4 STOP
START the UNK system used in tables 1 and 2 and figures 1 and 2 was continued for the 21 growth centers STOP
START the `` UNK '' on one end of each arrow indicates extent of difference in months between the child's onset age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center STOP
START the `` tip '' of the arrow represents extent of difference between the child's completion age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center STOP
START thus , the UNK of the `` UNK '' and `` UNK '' , respectively , indicate individual UNK of the 21 growth centers of each child with respect to the mean values for these boys and girls STOP
START the direction in which the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was changed at completion from the level at onset STOP
START when the `` UNK '' and `` tip '' UNK , the classification used in this paper is `` same schedule '' STOP
START the length of the arrow indicates amount of UNK or acceleration at completion over that at onset , and the difference in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale along the base of each figure , or more precisely by referring to the original data in the appropriate tables STOP
START the difference between the sequence of onset of UNK for the UNK UNK the UNK sequence in figures 3 and 4 STOP
START this difference is readily UNK by referring to table 1 STOP
START for example , arrow 17 in figure 3 UNK the UNK UNK UNK for boy 34 , whereas the same UNK for girl 2 is UNK by arrow 18 in figure 4 STOP
START for the boy , this UNK was UNK delayed at onset but near the mean at completion STOP
START thus , the span of its UNK was UNK and the UNK ability to `` catch up '' in UNK is demonstrated STOP
START in contrast , for the girl the UNK was slightly advanced at onset and delayed at completion STOP
START obviously , the UNK for her may have occurred at any point between onset and completion STOP
START the skeletal age curve in the lower portion of figure 2 shows that UNK may have occurred for her during the UNK period STOP
START length of the UNK of these UNK may be evaluated according to the standard deviation values for each center in table 1 STOP
START we have attempted to UNK the extensive task of UNK onset ages and completion ages of each child -- more than UNK values for the entire group -- by UNK figures for each of the 21 centers so that the data for all 34 boys and 34 of the girls will appear together for each growth center STOP
START figures 5 and 6 are examples of our method of UNK the results for each growth center STOP
START forty other figures similar to 5 and 6 and the original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this UNK have been included in the UNK STOP
START the principles used in making each arrow for figures 3 and 4 were applied to the construction of figures 5 and 6 as well as all figures in the UNK STOP
START one growth center in a short bone -- UNK UNK of the second finger -- was chosen as an example for discussion here , primarily because UNK UNK , the maturity UNK for completion in long and short bones , occurs in this center for girls near the UNK and for boys near their comparable UNK stage STOP
START its completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity UNK to include in studies of growth , UNK patterns , and health during adolescence STOP
START the following summary , based on figures 5 and 6 , is an example of one way of UNK the UNK figures constructed from onset ages and completion ages of individual children with respect to the appropriate mean age for each growth center STOP
START at the top of figure 5 , for example , the onset range and completion range lines for the chosen growth center have been drawn for girls according to their mean and standard deviation values in table 1 STOP
START the 34 UNK , UNK onset age plus completion age UNK , have been UNK in an onset sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest onset of the 34 girls STOP
START the growth center UNK here , in the UNK UNK of the second finger , is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short bones STOP
START the mean onset age was UNK months ( table 1 ) , and the average span of the UNK stage was UNK months STOP
START the correlation ( table 2 ) between onset age and completion age was UNK , and that between onset age and span was UNK STOP
START with due consideration for the limits of precision in UNK , expected rate of change in UNK of girls age 2 years , and the known variations in rate of UNK of these children as described in our preceding paper in the supplement , each arrow with a `` UNK length '' of four months or less was selected as UNK `` same schedule '' at onset and completion , for this particular UNK STOP
START accordingly , girls 31 , 29 , UNK , 21 , 26 , 13 , 3 , 4 , 14 , UNK , 24 , 25 , 34 , 23 , 6 , 15 , 22 , and 16 may be said to have the `` same schedule '' at onset and completion STOP
START it seems clear , from the UNK shape of the series of UNK in figure 5 that there was about an equal number of early and late UNK and UNK for the 34 girls STOP
START accordingly , if UNK UNK occurs in this UNK near UNK , early and late UNK might have been UNK rather precisely at the time of onset of UNK for the 18 girls with `` same schedule '' STOP
START as an example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which UNK four months in UNK length in conjunction with its position in the figure : girl 2 had a delayed onset and further delayed completion STOP

START this UNK does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be UNK in UNK by UNK systems STOP
START in addition , the UNK UNK formed in largest quantity in the UNK thyroid is UNK STOP
START if UNK and a system UNK hydrogen UNK are added to a UNK UNK of the thyroid , large UNK of free UNK can be formed ( alexander , 1959 ) STOP
START it is not clear whether this system bears any UNK to the in UNK UNK mechanism , and a system UNK UNK has not been identified in thyroid tissue STOP
START on chemical grounds it seems most likely that UNK is first converted to af and then to af as the active UNK species STOP
START in the thyroid UNK it appears that proteins ( chiefly thyroglobulin ) are UNK and that free UNK and UNK are not UNK STOP
START UNK of UNK , however , is not enough for the synthesis of hormone STOP
START the UNK and UNK must be coupled to form UNK and UNK STOP
START the mechanism of this UNK has been studied in some detail with UNK systems in UNK and can be UNK by certain UNK UNK ( UNK and james , 1958 ) STOP
START there is so far no evidence to indicate UNK that this UNK is under UNK control STOP
START the chemical nature of the UNK is discussed below ( UNK et UNK STOP

START thyroglobulin synthesis STOP
START little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of thyroglobulin STOP
START its synthesis has not been demonstrated in UNK systems , nor has its synthesis by systems with UNK thyroid cells in UNK been UNK UNK STOP
START there is some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of UNK , for in certain UNK UNK of the UNK thyroid containing essentially no UNK thyroglobulin , a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin has been observed in UNK experiments ( UNK , UNK and UNK , 1959 ) STOP
START similar findings have been noted in a patient with UNK absence of the UNK enzymes , whose thyroid tissue could only UNK UNK STOP
START in addition , depending on availability of UNK iodine , thyroglobulin may contain varying UNK of iodine STOP
START d STOP
START UNK STOP
START since the UNK thyroid UNK are the UNK UNK UNK and UNK ( UNK c ) , it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid UNK for their release from proteins before UNK STOP
START the presence of several UNK and UNK has been demonstrated in the thyroid STOP
START one of the UNK has UNK optimum of about UNK and another of about UNK ( UNK , UNK and UNK , 1954 ; ; STOP
START UNK , UNK and UNK , 1955 ) STOP
START the finding that the concentration of one of these UNK is increased in thyroid UNK from UNK animals suggests that this UNK may be active in UNK STOP
START there is no UNK evidence yet that either of the UNK has been prepared in highly UNK form nor is their UNK known STOP
START a study of their activity on thyroglobulin has shown that UNK is not UNK released and that the UNK UNK UNK with the formation of UNK UNK ( UNK , UNK and UNK , 1956 ) STOP
START besides UNK enzymes the thyroid UNK UNK enzymes STOP
START a UNK UNK with a UNK optimum of around 8 , and requiring reduced UNK UNK for activity , has been identified in the thyroid ( UNK , 1957 ) STOP
START this UNK UNK is effective against UNK and UNK , but does not UNK UNK or UNK STOP
START it is assumed that the iodine released from the UNK remains in the UNK pool of the thyroid , where it is UNK and UNK into thyroglobulin STOP
START the UNK and UNK released by UNK and so UNK UNK presumably UNK into the blood stream STOP
START it has been shown that thyroglobulin UNK UNK , but the binding does not appear to be particularly strong STOP
START it has been suggested that the plasma UNK proteins , which have an extremely high UNK for UNK , compete with thyroglobulin for UNK ( UNK and UNK , 1957 ) STOP
START e STOP
START UNK drugs STOP
START UNK drugs are of two general types STOP
START one type has a small UNK UNK of the UNK type STOP
START this UNK UNK thyroid hormone synthesis by UNK with UNK concentration in the thyroid STOP
START it does not appear to affect the UNK mechanism as such STOP
START the other group of UNK agents or drugs is UNK by UNK STOP
START these drugs have no effect on the UNK UNK mechanism , but they UNK UNK STOP
START the mechanism of action of these drugs has not been completely worked out , but certain of them appear to act by reducing the UNK form of iodine before it can UNK thyroglobulin ( UNK , 1954 ) STOP
START on the other hand , there are a few UNK drugs of this same general type , such as UNK , UNK no reducing activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular iodine STOP
START any of the UNK drugs , of either type , if given in large enough UNK for a long period of time will cause UNK , UNK to UNK of thyroid hormone synthesis , with production of UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK of the UNK then UNK by an increased output of tsh , causing the thyroid to UNK STOP
START the effect of drugs that act on the UNK mechanism can be UNK by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet STOP
START the UNK drugs of the UNK type , however , are not UNK by such means STOP
START besides those of the UNK and UNK types , certain UNK drugs have been found in naturally occurring foods STOP
START the most UNK identified is UNK , which was isolated from UNK ( UNK , 1950 ) STOP
START it is UNK to occur in other members of the UNK family STOP
START there is some evidence that naturally occurring UNK may play a role in the development of UNK , particularly in UNK and UNK ( UNK and UNK , 1956 ) STOP
START there it seems that the UNK UNK by dairy animals is itself UNK but is converted in the animal to an active UNK , which is then UNK in the milk STOP
START f STOP
START UNK influences STOP
START besides the presence of UNK in the diet , the level of iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity of the thyroid UNK STOP
START in the experimental animal and in man gross UNK in UNK iodine causes thyroid UNK , UNK and increased thyroid activity ( money , UNK and UNK , 1952 ; ; STOP
START UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK UNK , 1954 ) STOP
START in man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of UNK is about 100 UNK per day STOP
START with lower levels , thyroid UNK and increased thyroid UNK enable the thyroid to UNK a larger proportion of the daily UNK of iodine STOP
START further , the UNK is able to UNK a larger fraction of the thyroid hormone UNK UNK STOP
START in the presence of a low iodine UNK , thyroglobulin UNK in UNK with af is found to contain more UNK than normal , the amounts of UNK and UNK being UNK reduced STOP
START this appears to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid UNK of newly UNK thyroglobulin STOP
START if the UNK UNK long enough , it is reasonable to suppose that the af UNK will reflect the af distribution in the thyroglobulin STOP
START similar results might be expected from the influence of drugs or UNK conditions that limit UNK UNK , or UNK , or UNK thyroglobulin UNK STOP
START b STOP
START the UNK hormone STOP
START the name UNK hormone ( tsh ) has been given to a substance found in the UNK UNK UNK of all species of animal so tested for its presence STOP
START the hormone has also been called UNK or UNK hormone STOP
START at the present time we do not know by what UNK mechanism tsh acts on the thyroid , but for UNK of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated , including release of iodine from the thyroid , increase in thyroid weight , increase in mean height of the UNK cells and increase in the UNK UNK of af STOP
START here we shall UNK discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determining the concentration of tsh in blood STOP
START brown ( 1959 ) has UNK generally the various methods of UNK tsh , and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on the subject STOP

START chemical constitution and physical properties of UNK tsh STOP
START as long ago as UNK it was pointed out by UNK ( UNK ) that there is a connection between the UNK and the thyroid STOP
START this connection was UNK by smith and smith ( UNK ) , who showed that saline UNK of fresh UNK UNK UNK could UNK the UNK UNK of UNK UNK STOP
START the first attempts to UNK tsh came a decade later , when UNK and UNK ( UNK ) used UNK UNK to separate the UNK tsh from UNK UNK STOP
START after their work other investigators applied UNK techniques to the problem , as well as UNK with organic UNK , such as UNK STOP
START albert ( 1949 ) has concluded that the most active preparations of tsh made during this period , from UNK to 1945 , were probably about 100 to 300 times as UNK as the starting material STOP
START much of this work has been UNK by white ( UNK ) and by albert ( 1949 ) STOP
START developments up to about 1957 have been discussed by UNK ( 1958 ) STOP
START in the last few years , the application of UNK and other modern techniques to the problem of UNK tsh has led to further UNK ( UNK and UNK , 1960 ; ; STOP
START UNK , UNK and UNK , 1960 ) STOP
START the most active preparations obtained by these two groups of investigators appear to be similar in UNK , composition and physical properties STOP
START two problems present themselves in considering any hormone in blood STOP
START first , is the UNK form of the hormone the same as that found in the UNK where it is UNK and stored ? ? STOP
START second , what is its concentration in normal circumstances and in what circumstances will this concentration UNK from the normal level and in which direction ? ? STOP
START it is therefore necessary to consider the properties of UNK tsh if the UNK chemical information about blood tsh is to be discussed UNK STOP
START the importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is UNK by the recent observation that there exists an UNK UNK tsh in blood drawn from many UNK patients ( adams , 1958 ) STOP
START whether this UNK tsh UNK UNK from UNK tsh , or is , UNK , normal tsh with its period of effectiveness modified by some other blood UNK , cannot be decided without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison of the substance responsible for the blood activity with UNK aj STOP
START in UNK data on the concentration of tsh in blood , one must examine UNK the UNK methods used to obtain them STOP
START the introduction of the united states UNK reference standard in 1952 and the UNK and UNK of the UNK and international units of UNK activity have made it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time STOP
START we should like to UNK the importance of stating results solely in terms of international units of tsh activity and of UNK the UNK of biological units STOP
START for the most part , this discussion will be confined to results obtained since the introduction of the reference standard STOP
START a STOP
START standard preparations and units of UNK activity STOP
START the international unit ( UNK , adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different UNK ( UNK and UNK , 1955 ) , has been defined as the amount of activity present in UNK mg of the international standard preparation STOP

START UNK the sections with UNK before UNK the intermediate sera did not improve the staining reaction STOP
START in addition to other treatments , UNK the sections with normal sheep serum for half an hour before UNK af did not reduce nonspecific staining STOP
START the only treatment by which nonspecific staining could be UNK removed was by passing the UNK through a UNK column STOP
START when 1 ml of UNK was passed through a column ( af ) , the first and second UNK fractions collected were the most specific and gave no nonspecific staining in some experiments , and very little in others STOP
START in the latter cases an additional treatment of the UNK af with 50 mg of sweet clover stem tissue powder further improved the UNK STOP
START after these treatments the UNK did not UNK healthy or crown UNK sweet clover UNK or stained them a very UNK green which was easily UNK from the bright UNK specific staining STOP
START with this UNK UNK the best staining procedure consisted of UNK the sections with 1 : 10 UNK of af for 30 minutes , washing with UNK for 15 minutes , staining with af for 30 minutes , and washing with UNK for 15 minutes STOP
START the UNK of staining in wtv UNK with af and af but not with UNK and af or with UNK to UNK UNK UNK and af , and the absence of such staining in crown UNK tumor tissue from UNK , indicate that an antigen of wtv was being stained STOP
START direct method STOP
START af was first UNK with 50 mg of UNK per UNK of UNK STOP
START this UNK was passed twice through UNK and treated with various tissue UNK in the same manner as described for the indirect method STOP
START in all cases a disturbing amount of nonspecific staining was still present although it was still UNK from specific fluorescence STOP
START in later experiments , af and af were prepared by UNK 8 mg of UNK per UNK of UNK STOP
START these conjugates af had much less nonspecific staining than the previous UNK ( with 50 mg UNK per UNK of UNK ) while the specific staining was similar in both cases STOP
START nonspecific staining could be UNK eliminated by passing these conjugates through a UNK column as described for af STOP
START the best staining procedure with this UNK af consisted of staining with the UNK for 30 minutes and washing in UNK for 15 minutes STOP
START the UNK of staining with af was established as follows : af specifically stained tumor sections but not sections of healthy sweet clover stems or of crown UNK tumor tissue from sweet clover STOP
START sections of UNK UNK by wtv were not similarly stained with UNK normal serum or UNK UNK to UNK UNK UNK STOP
START after passing af through UNK , the UNK of UNK to wtv in the specific fraction was 1 : 4 of the UNK before such passage ( UNK ring tests by UNK ) ; ; STOP
START but mere UNK of the UNK to 1 : 4 did not UNK remove nonspecific staining STOP
START this indicates that increase in UNK of af after passing it through UNK was not merely due to UNK STOP
START specific staining by UNK treated af and af , although clearly UNK under the UNK from either nonspecific staining or UNK of cells , was not UNK UNK to show such differences in spite of many attempts with black and white and color UNK STOP
START this was chiefly because of the UNK white UNK from the cells STOP
START the UNK from the walls of the UNK cells was particularly brilliant STOP
START distribution of UNK antigen STOP
START results of specific staining by the direct and the indirect methods were similar and showed the UNK of wtv antigen in certain UNK of UNK STOP
START the UNK antigen was concentrated in the UNK tissue STOP
START frequently a few isolated UNK cells or , rarely , groups of such cells in the UNK region , were also specifically stained , but there was no such staining in UNK , UNK , most UNK cells , UNK cells , or UNK STOP
START within the UNK cells the distribution of wtv antigen was UNK in the UNK STOP
START no antigen was UNK in certain dark UNK areas in most cells STOP
START these areas are thought to represent the nuclei STOP
START in some tumor sections small UNK bodies , possibly UNK bodies ( UNK and black , 1952 ) stained more UNK than the rest of UNK and probably contained more antigen STOP
START in all cases studied UNK of the stem on which the tumor had developed did not contain UNK amounts of wtv antigen STOP
START discussion STOP
START in both the direct and indirect methods of staining , the conjugates had UNK staining fractions STOP
START in the indirect method , this was evident from the fact that tumor sections were stained light green even when stained with UNK and af or with af only STOP
START in the direct method , af , not further treated , stained certain UNK of healthy sweet clover stems UNK and wtv tumor sections were similarly stained by comparable af STOP
START after af and af were passed through UNK twice and treated twice with healthy sweet clover tissue powder , nonspecific staining was greatly reduced but a disturbing amount of such staining was still present STOP
START treatment of the conjugates with UNK UNK , and the conjugates ( which had been passed through UNK ) with UNK liver powder , sweet clover crown UNK tissue powder , or healthy sweet clover proteins did not UNK remove UNK staining substances in the conjugates STOP
START such treatments of the conjugates have usually been successful in UNK nonspecific staining in several other systems ( UNK , 1958 ) STOP
START UNK and UNK ( 1959 ) did not report any such nonspecific staining of plant UNK with UNK UNK UNK to tobacco UNK UNK STOP
START the reason for the failure of these treatments to eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugates in our system is not known STOP
START in our work the best procedure for UNK substances causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was to pass the conjugates through a UNK column and in some cases to UNK the first and second UNK fractions with sweet clover tissue powder STOP
START the specific staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that wtv antigen was concentrated in the UNK tissue and in a few UNK cells in the UNK region , but was not UNK in any other UNK of the root and stem UNK STOP
START a study of the distribution of wtv antigen within the UNK cells indicates that it is UNK distributed in the UNK STOP
START UNK UNK is a UNK UNK UNK not easily UNK by mechanical UNK ( black , UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK et UNK , 1954 ) STOP
START the concentration and apparent UNK of the wtv antigen in UNK tissue of the tumor may indicate that the UNK UNK UNK in the UNK and may need to be directly placed in this tissue in order to UNK plants STOP
START since emotional reactions in the higher UNK depend on individual experience and are aroused in man , in addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be UNK from the UNK STOP
START in experiments with UNK application of UNK on the UNK UNK , the transmission of UNK from the UNK to the hypothalamus was demonstrated STOP
START moreover , the UNK of the hypothalamus to UNK UNK is greatly increased under these conditions STOP
START even more complex and obviously UNK induced forms of emotional UNK could be UNK in UNK a on seeing UNK b ( but not a UNK ) in emotional stress STOP
START a previously UNK conditioned reaction was UNK in UNK a and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic UNK STOP
START it seems to follow that by and large an UNK exists between the UNK and the UNK as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional UNK of the UNK STOP
START in addition , the UNK relations play a great role in UNK , as UNK interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' UNK STOP
START but even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the UNK , sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the UNK brain is UNK by the UNK STOP
START UNK stressed correctly the importance of the UNK brain for preservation of the individual and the species , as evidenced by the influence of the UNK brain ( including the hypothalamus ) on emotions related to fight and flight and also on sexual functions STOP
START it should be added that in man UNK UNK probably play a role in the UNK of emotional processes with those underlying perception , memory , imagination , and UNK STOP
START previous experiences are obviously of great importance for the UNK and UNK emotional response STOP
START the UNK brain as well as the UNK is known to contribute to memory , but this UNK is beyond the scope of this paper STOP
START 13 STOP
START hypothalamic balance and its significance STOP
START after this brief discussion of UNK , UNK , and UNK relations , let us return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and UNK significance STOP
START UNK processes take place between UNK and hypothalamus via UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START thus UNK UNK induced by UNK application of UNK to a minute area in the UNK UNK with UNK present in the hypothalamus and cause increased UNK UNK STOP
START on the other hand , the temporary reduction in hypothalamic UNK through the UNK of a UNK into the UNK hypothalamus causes a UNK in frequency and UNK of UNK UNK UNK until the hypothalamic UNK is UNK STOP
START apparently , a positive UNK exists between the UNK hypothalamus and the UNK UNK STOP
START consequently , if for any reason the hypothalamic UNK falls below the physiological level , the UNK UNK UNK lead to a UNK state of activity in the UNK with UNK reduction in the UNK UNK STOP
START obviously , a UNK cycle UNK STOP
START this tendency can be broken either by UNK hypothalamic UNK directly or via UNK UNK STOP
START it is believed that drug therapy and UNK involve the former and UNK the latter mechanism STOP
START before we comment further on these UNK conditions , we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limits distinguish sleep from UNK STOP
START thus , a low intensity of UNK UNK UNK in sleep and a high one during UNK , resulting in UNK UNK UNK in the former and UNK in the latter condition STOP
START moreover , the UNK in UNK action ( with UNK UNK of the sympathetic ) at the hypothalamic level UNK , by its UNK action , the autonomic UNK of sleep and , by its action on the UNK , a UNK in the reactivity of the UNK and motor apparatus of the UNK UNK system STOP
START with the UNK of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus , the opposite changes occur STOP
START since electrical UNK of the UNK hypothalamus produces the effects of UNK while UNK of the UNK hypothalamus UNK sleep , it may be said that the reactivity of the whole UNK is altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus STOP
START similar effects can be induced UNK via the UNK UNK in man and animals STOP
START of particular importance is the study of the actions of drugs in this respect STOP
START although no drugs act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it , there is sufficient UNK to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a UNK UNK STOP
START the former UNK UNK and UNK drugs , the latter the UNK STOP
START specific differences exist in the action of different drugs UNK to the same group as , for instance , between UNK and UNK STOP
START important as these differences are , they should not UNK the basic fact that by UNK the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the UNK side , we produce UNK , whereas a shift in the opposite direction causes UNK effects and , eventually , UNK changes STOP
START the emotional states produced by drugs influence the UNK UNK in a characteristic manner ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK in the UNK of the experimental animal after administration of UNK , but UNK after application of UNK and UNK drugs STOP
START the shock UNK act likewise on the hypothalamic balance STOP
START physiological experiments and clinical observations have shown that these procedures influence the UNK controlled UNK UNK and increase sympathetic UNK STOP
START they shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side STOP
START this explains the UNK effect of UNK therapy in certain UNK and a shift in the reaction from UNK to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the UNK test STOP
START some investigators have found a UNK between UNK and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the UNK test and , UNK , between clinical UNK and increasing deviation of this test from the UNK STOP
START nevertheless , the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of UNK patients has not yet been tested on an adequate number of patients STOP
START the UNK and UNK tests applied with certain UNK are reliable UNK of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of UNK autonomic and clinical states , and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions , additional tests seem to be desirable STOP
START it was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring UNK in UNK patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the UNK cycle STOP
START a change in the balance to the UNK side leads in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstances , to UNK UNK or UNK and UNK STOP
START in both conditions the emotional and UNK sensitivity is UNK , but no depression occurs such as is seen UNK or may be produced in normal persons by drugs STOP
START the fundamental differences between physiological and UNK states of UNK ( and also of sympathetic ) UNK remain to be UNK STOP
START perhaps a UNK to these and related problems lies in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic UNK which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to UNK UNK in reactivity STOP
START a state of UNK `` UNK '' of the hypothalamus induced UNK causes not only an increase in the UNK reactivity of this structure to direct and UNK induced UNK , but leads also to an autonomic UNK : a stimulus acting UNK under control conditions UNK in this state of UNK a UNK response ! ! STOP
START furthermore , conditioned reactions are UNK altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is UNK beyond a critical level , and several types of UNK changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic `` UNK '' are observed STOP
START if , for instance , such a change is produced by one or a few UNK UNK or UNK , previously UNK conditioned reactions UNK STOP
START however , if these procedures are applied more often , conditioned emotional responses are temporarily UNK STOP
START in other studies , loss of UNK in previously established conditioned UNK resulted from repeated UNK ( UNK ) treatments , UNK a fundamental UNK in the balance between UNK and UNK UNK processes STOP
START it has further been shown that : ( 1 ) an experimental UNK in its initial stages is associated with a UNK shift in the central autonomic balance ; ; STOP
START ( 2 ) drugs UNK the hypothalamic balance UNK conditioned reactions ; ; STOP
START ( 3 ) in a state of depression , the positive conditioned stimulus may fail to UNK a conditioned reaction but cause an increased UNK instead of the UNK UNK ( UNK ) effect on the aj STOP
START these are few and seemingly UNK data , but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental UNK in conditioned reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation , UNK action , or clinical processes STOP
START 14 STOP
START on the physiological basis of some form of UNK STOP
START the UNK remarks UNK that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the UNK between physiological and UNK forms of emotion STOP
START if this is the case , one would expect that not only the various procedures just mentioned which UNK the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise STOP
START we pointed out that emotional excitement may lead to UNK UNK and UNK UNK , particularly in certain types of personality , but it is also known that the UNK of a strong emotion ( `` UNK '' ) may cure a battle UNK STOP
START this phenomenon raises the question whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may not have an even wider application in the area of the UNK STOP
START being a strictly physiological procedure , one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself STOP
START UNK experiments and therapeutic work lie in this area STOP
START he showed UNK that anxiety is a learned ( conditioned ) reaction and is the basis of experimental and clinical UNK and assumed , therefore , that the UNK changes which UNK the UNK are functional and UNK STOP
START an important observation of UNK served as a guide post to achieve such a UNK by physiological means STOP
START in a conditioning experiment , he demonstrated the UNK between feeding and pain STOP
START a UNK electrical shock served as a conditioned stimulus and was followed by feeding STOP
START the pain became thus the symbol for food and UNK UNK UNK ( conditioned UNK ) STOP
START even when the intensity of the UNK was increased gradually , it failed to UNK any signs of pain STOP
START since strong UNK UNK produce an experimental UNK during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental situation , UNK thought that he could UNK the UNK UNK to UNK the UNK UNK through feeding STOP
START appropriate experiments showed that this is , indeed , possible STOP
START he then applied this principle of UNK UNK to human UNK STOP
START he took advantage of the UNK between aggressive UNK and anxiety and found a relatively rapid UNK of anxiety when the former attitude was established STOP
START for the interpretation of these significant investigations , it should be remembered that UNK relations exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and UNK functions which are closely associated with the emotions STOP
START the UNK UNK seems to be based on this UNK relation between the UNK and UNK systems STOP
START furthermore , a functional UNK exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety STOP
START although in both emotions sympathetic UNK are present , different UNK patterns UNK UNK and anxiety , respectively , as indicated by the rate of the UNK of the UNK , the state of the muscle tone , and the UNK test STOP
START the psychological UNK of these emotional states seems to be reflected in , or based on , this marked difference STOP
START 15 STOP
START UNK remarks STOP
START in our attempt to UNK the emotions in their physiological and UNK range , we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity of the UNK and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the UNK and UNK systems , respectively STOP
START we stressed the UNK relation of these systems with respect to the UNK downward discharge as well as regarding the UNK discharge STOP
START although we are still far from a complete understanding of these problems , as a first UNK , it is suggested that UNK in the hypothalamic balance with UNK changes in the UNK UNK account for major changes in behavior seen in various UNK and states of emotions in man and UNK under physiological circumstances , in experimental and clinical UNK , and as the result of UNK agents STOP
START in view of the important role which emotional UNK play in the UNK of UNK and UNK UNK and the UNK observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances , it is further suggested that a hypothalamic UNK may play an important role in UNK mental changes STOP
START UNK STOP
START the primary decomposition theorem STOP
START we are trying to study a linear operator t on the UNK space v , by UNK t into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense UNK STOP
START we can do this through the characteristic values and UNK of t in certain special cases , i.e, when the minimal polynomial for t factors over the UNK field f into a product of distinct UNK UNK of degree 1 STOP
START what can we do with the general t ? ? STOP
START if we try to study t using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems STOP
START first , t may not have a single characteristic value ; ; STOP
START this is really a UNK in the UNK field , namely , that it is not UNK closed STOP
START second , even if the characteristic polynomial factors completely over f into a product of UNK of degree 1 , there may not be enough characteristic UNK for t to span the space v STOP
START this is clearly a UNK in t STOP
START the second situation is illustrated by the operator t on af ( f any field ) represented in the standard basis by af STOP
START the characteristic polynomial for a is af and this is plainly also the minimal polynomial for a ( or for t ) STOP
START thus t is not diagonalizable STOP
START one sees that this happens because the UNK space of af has UNK 1 only STOP
START on the other hand , the UNK space of af and the UNK space of af together span v , the former being the UNK UNK by af and the latter the UNK UNK by af and af STOP
START this will be more or less our general method for the second problem STOP
START if ( remember this is an assumption ) the minimal polynomial for t UNK af where af are distinct elements of f , then we shall show that the space v is the direct sum of the UNK UNK of af STOP
START the diagonalizable operator is the special case of this in which af for each i STOP
START the theorem which we prove is more general than what we have described , since it works with the primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial , whether or not the UNK which enter are all of first degree STOP
START the reader will find it helpful to think of the special case when the UNK are of degree 1 , and even more particularly , to think of the proof of theorem 10 , a special case of this theorem STOP
START theorem 12 STOP
START ( primary decomposition theorem ) STOP
START let t be a linear operator on the UNK vector space v over the field f STOP
START let p be the minimal polynomial for t , af , where the af , are distinct UNK UNK UNK over f and the af are positive UNK STOP
START let af be the UNK space of af STOP
START then ( a ) af ; ; STOP
START ( b ) each af is invariant under t ; ; STOP
START ( c ) if af is the operator induced on af by t , then the minimal polynomial for af is af STOP
START proof STOP
START the idea of the proof is this STOP
START if the UNK decomposition ( a ) is valid , how can we get hold of the UNK af associated with the decomposition ? ? STOP
START the UNK af will be the identity on af and zero on the other af STOP
START we shall find a polynomial af such that af is the identity on af and is zero on the other af , and so that af , etc STOP
START for each i , let af STOP
START since af are distinct prime UNK , the UNK af are relatively prime ( theorem 8 , chapter 4 ) STOP
START thus there are UNK af such that af STOP
START note also that if af , then af is UNK by the polynomial p , because af contains each af as a factor STOP
START we shall show that the UNK af UNK in the manner described in the first UNK of the proof STOP
START let af STOP
START since af and p UNK af for af , we have af STOP
START thus the af are UNK which UNK to some UNK decomposition of the space v STOP
START we wish to show that the range of af is exactly the UNK af STOP
START it is clear that each vector in the range of af is in af for if UNK is in the range of af , then af and so af because af is UNK by the minimal polynomial p STOP
START UNK , suppose that UNK is in the UNK space of af STOP
START if af , then af is UNK by af and so af , i.e, af STOP
START but then it is immediate that af , i.e, that UNK is in the range of af STOP
START this UNK the proof of statement ( a ) STOP
START it is certainly clear that the UNK af are invariant under t STOP
START if af is the operator induced on af by t , then evidently af , because by definition af is 0 on the UNK af STOP
START this shows that the minimal polynomial for af UNK af STOP
START UNK , let g be any polynomial such that af STOP
START then af STOP
START thus af is UNK by the minimal polynomial p of t , i.e, af UNK af STOP
START it is easily seen that af UNK g STOP
START hence the minimal polynomial for af is af STOP
START UNK STOP
START if af are the UNK associated with the primary decomposition of t , then each af is a polynomial in t , and accordingly if a linear operator UNK UNK with t then UNK UNK with each of the af , i.e, each UNK af is invariant under UNK STOP
START in the UNK of the proof of theorem 12 , let us take a look at the special case in which the minimal polynomial for t is a product of UNK UNK , i.e, the case in which each af is of the form af STOP
START now the range of af is the UNK space af of af STOP
START let us put af STOP
START by theorem 10 , d is a diagonalizable operator which we shall call the diagonalizable part of t STOP
START let us look at the operator af STOP
START now af af so af STOP
START the reader should be familiar enough with UNK by now so that he sees that af and in general that af STOP
START when af for each i , we shall have af , because the operator af will then be 0 on the range of af STOP
START definition STOP
START let n be a linear operator on the vector space v STOP
START we say that n is nilpotent if there is some positive UNK r such that af STOP
START theorem 13 STOP
START let t be a linear operator on the UNK vector space v over the field f STOP
START suppose that the minimal polynomial for t UNK over f into a product of linear UNK STOP
START then there is a diagonalizable operator d on v and a nilpotent operator n in v such that ( a ) af , ( b ) af STOP
START the diagonalizable operator d and the nilpotent operator n are UNK determined by ( a ) and ( b ) and each of them is a polynomial in t STOP
START proof STOP
START we have just observed that we can write af where d is diagonalizable and n is nilpotent , and where d and n not only UNK but are UNK in t STOP
START now suppose that we also have af where UNK is diagonalizable , UNK is nilpotent , and af STOP
START we shall prove that af STOP
START since UNK and UNK UNK with one another and af , we see that UNK and UNK UNK with t STOP
START thus UNK and UNK UNK with any polynomial in t ; ; STOP
START hence they UNK with d and with n STOP
START now we have af or af and all four of these operators UNK with one another STOP
START since d and UNK are both diagonalizable and they UNK , they are simultaneously diagonalizable , and af is diagonalizable STOP
START since n and UNK are both nilpotent and they UNK , the operator af is nilpotent ; ; STOP
START for , using the fact that n and UNK UNK af and so when r is sufficiently large every term in this expression for af will be 0 STOP
START ( actually , a nilpotent operator on an UNK space must have its t power 0 ; ; STOP
START if we take af above , that will be large enough STOP
START it then follows that af is large enough , but this is not obvious from the above expression STOP
START ) now af is a diagonalizable operator which is also nilpotent STOP
START such an operator is obviously the zero operator ; ; STOP
START for since it is nilpotent , the minimal polynomial for this operator is of the form af for some af ; ; STOP
START but then since the operator is diagonalizable , the minimal polynomial cannot have a repeated root ; ; STOP
START hence af and the minimal polynomial is simply x , which says the operator is 0 STOP
START thus we see that af and af STOP
START UNK STOP
START let v be a UNK vector space over an UNK closed field f , e.g, the field of complex numbers STOP
START then every linear operator t in v can be written as the sum of a diagonalizable operator d and a nilpotent operator n which UNK STOP
START these operators d and n are unique and each is a polynomial in t STOP
START from these results , one sees that the study of linear operators on vector UNK over an UNK closed field is essentially reduced to the study of nilpotent operators STOP
START for vector UNK over UNK closed fields , we still need to find some substitute for characteristic values and UNK STOP
START it is a very interesting fact that these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we shall do in the next chapter STOP
START in UNK this section , we should like to give an example which UNK some of the ideas of the primary decomposition theorem STOP
START we have chosen to give it at the end of the section since it deals with differential UNK and thus is not purely linear UNK STOP
START example 11 STOP
START in the primary decomposition theorem , it is not necessary that the vector space v be UNK dimensional , nor is it necessary for parts ( a ) and ( b ) that p be the minimal polynomial for t STOP
START if t is a linear operator on an arbitrary vector space and if there is a UNK polynomial p such that af , then parts ( a ) and ( b ) of theorem 12 are valid for t with the proof which we gave STOP
START let n be a positive UNK and let v be the space of all n times continuously UNK functions f on the real line which satisfy the differential equation af where af are some fixed UNK STOP
START if af UNK the space of n times continuously UNK functions , then the space v of solutions of this differential equation is a UNK of af STOP
START if d UNK the UNK operator and p is the polynomial af then v is the UNK space of the operator p ( , ) , because af simply says af STOP
START let us now regard d as a linear operator on the UNK v STOP
START then af STOP
START if we are discussing UNK UNK functions , then af and v are complex vector UNK , and af may be any complex numbers STOP
START we now write af where af are distinct complex numbers STOP
START if af is the UNK space of af , then theorem 12 says that af STOP
START in other words , if f UNK the differential equation af , then f is UNK UNK in the form af where af UNK the differential equation af STOP
START thus , the study of the solutions to the equation af is reduced to the study of the space of solutions of a differential equation of the form af STOP
START this reduction has been accomplished by the general methods of linear UNK , i.e, by the primary decomposition theorem STOP
START to describe the space of solutions to af , one must know something about differential UNK ; ; STOP
START that is , one must know something about d other than the fact that it is a linear operator STOP
START however , one does not need to know very much STOP
START it is very easy to establish by UNK on r that if f is in af then af ; ; STOP
START that is , af , etc STOP
START thus af if and only if af STOP
START a function g such that af , i.e, af , must be a polynomial function of degree af or less : af STOP
START thus f UNK af if and only if f has the form af STOP
START accordingly , the ' functions ' af span the space of solutions of af STOP
START since af are UNK independent functions and the UNK function has no UNK , these r functions af , form a basis for the space of solutions STOP
START UNK STOP
START examples of binomial experiments STOP
START some experiments are composed of UNK of independent trials , each with two possible outcomes STOP
START the binomial probability distribution may describe the variation that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment to another STOP
START we UNK a chapter to the binomial distribution not only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real life phenomena , but also because it has important properties that UNK in many other probability models STOP
START we begin with a few examples of binomial experiments STOP
START UNK example STOP
START a trained UNK shooting five UNK at a target , all under practically the same conditions , may hit the UNK from 0 to 5 times STOP
START in repeated sets of five UNK his numbers of UNK vary STOP
START what can we say of the probabilities of the different possible numbers of UNK ? ? STOP
START UNK in UNK STOP
START in UNK of eight UNK from similar parents , the number of UNK with straight instead of UNK hair is an UNK from 0 to 8 STOP
START what probabilities should be attached to these possible outcomes ? ? STOP
START UNK ( ones ) with three UNK STOP
START when three UNK are UNK repeatedly , what is the probability that the number of UNK is 0 ( or 1 , or 2 , or 3 ) ? ? STOP
START general binomial problem STOP
START more generally , suppose that an experiment consists of a number of independent trials , that each trial results in either a `` success '' or a `` UNK '' ( `` failure '' ) , and that the probability of success remains constant from trial to trial STOP
START in the examples above , the occurrence of a UNK , a UNK UNK , or an UNK could be called a `` success '' STOP
START in general , any outcome we choose may be UNK `` success '' STOP
START the major question in this chapter is : what is the probability of exactly x successes in n trials ? ? STOP
START in chapters 3 and 4 we answered questions like those in the examples , usually by UNK points in a sample space STOP
START fortunately , a general formula of wide UNK UNK all problems of this kind STOP
START before UNK this formula , we explain what we mean by `` problems of this kind '' STOP
START experiments are often composed of several identical trials , and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated STOP
START in the UNK example , a trial consists of `` one round shot at a target '' with outcome either one UNK ( success ) or none ( failure ) STOP
START further , an experiment might consist of five UNK , and several sets of five UNK might be regarded as a UNK composed of several UNK of the UNK experiment STOP
START if three UNK are UNK , a trial is one UNK of one die and the experiment is composed of three trials STOP
START or , what amounts to the same thing , if one die is UNK three times , each UNK is a trial , and the three UNK form the experiment STOP
START UNK , we shall not distinguish the experiment of three UNK UNK once from that of one die UNK three times STOP
START these examples are UNK of the use of the words `` trial '' and `` experiment '' as they are used in this chapter , but they are quite flexible words and it is well not to UNK them too UNK STOP
START example 1 STOP
START student UNK managers STOP
START ten students act as managers for a UNK UNK team , and of these managers a proportion p are UNK UNK STOP
START each friday one manager is chosen by lot to stay late and load the equipment on a UNK STOP
START on three UNK the UNK has needed a UNK STOP
START considering only these UNK , what is the probability that the UNK had UNK all 3 times ? ? STOP
START exactly 2 times ? ? STOP
START 1 time ? ? STOP
START 0 times ? ? STOP
START discussion STOP
START note that there are 3 trials of interest STOP
START each trial consists of UNK a student manager at random STOP
START the 2 possible outcomes on each trial are `` UNK '' or `` UNK '' STOP
START since the choice is by lot each week , the outcomes of different trials are independent STOP
START the managers stay the same , so that af is the same for all weeks STOP
START we now UNK these ideas for general binomial experiments STOP
START for an experiment to UNK as a binomial experiment , it must have four properties : ( 1 ) there must be a fixed number of trials , ( 2 ) each trial must result in a `` success '' or a `` failure '' ( a binomial trial ) , ( 3 ) all trials must have identical probabilities of success , ( 4 ) the trials must be independent of each other STOP
START below we use our earlier examples to describe and illustrate these four properties STOP
START we also give , for each property , an example where the property is absent STOP
START the language and UNK introduced are standard throughout the chapter STOP
START 1 STOP
START there must be a fixed number n of repeated trials STOP
START for the UNK , we study sets of five UNK ( af ) ; ; STOP
START for the UNK , we UNK attention to UNK of eight ( af ) ; ; STOP
START and for the UNK , we UNK three UNK ( af ) STOP
START experiment without a fixed number of trials STOP
START UNK a die until an UNK appears STOP
START here the number of trials is a random variable , not a fixed number STOP
START 2 STOP
START binomial trials STOP
START each of the n trials is either a success or a failure STOP
START `` success '' and `` failure '' are just convenient UNK for the two categories of outcomes when we talk about binomial trials in general STOP
START these words are more UNK than UNK like `` a '' and `` UNK '' STOP
START it is natural from the UNK viewpoint to call a UNK a success , but in the UNK example it is arbitrary which category UNK to straight hair in a UNK STOP
START the word `` binomial '' means `` of two names '' or `` of two terms '' , and both UNK apply in our work : the first to the names of the two outcomes of a binomial trial , and the second to the terms p and af that represent the probabilities of `` success '' and `` failure '' STOP
START sometimes when there are many outcomes for a single trial , we group these outcomes into two classes , as in the example of the die , where we have UNK constructed the classes `` UNK '' and `` UNK '' STOP
START experiment without the UNK property STOP
START we UNK UNK as `` UNK '' or `` UNK '' , but a UNK UNK appears STOP
START we can escape from such a difficulty by ruling out the animal as not UNK a trial , but such a solution is not always satisfactory STOP
START 3 STOP
START all trials have identical probabilities of success STOP
START each die has probability af of producing an UNK ; ; STOP
START the UNK has some probability p , perhaps UNK , of making a UNK STOP
START note that we need not know the value of p , for the experiment to be binomial STOP
START experiment where p is not constant STOP
START during a round of target practice the sun comes from behind a cloud and UNK the UNK , UNK his chance of a UNK STOP
START 4 STOP
START the trials are independent STOP
START strictly speaking , this means that the probability for each possible outcome of the experiment can be computed by UNK together the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the single binomial trials STOP
START thus in the UNK example af , af , and the independence assumption UNK that the probability that the three UNK fall UNK , UNK , UNK in that order is af STOP
START UNK , we expect independence when the trials have nothing to do with one another STOP
START examples where independence UNK STOP
START a family of five plans to go together either to the beach or to the mountains , and a UNK is UNK to decide STOP
START we want to know the number of people going to the mountains STOP
START when this experiment is viewed as composed of five binomial trials , one for each member of the family , the outcomes of the trials are obviously not independent STOP
START indeed , the experiment is better viewed as consisting of one binomial trial for the entire family STOP
START the following is a less extreme example of dependence STOP
START consider UNK visiting an art museum STOP
START each person UNK for one of a pair of pictures to receive a popular prize STOP
START voting for one picture may be called `` success '' , for the other `` failure '' STOP
START an experiment consists of the voting of one couple , or two trials STOP
START in UNK of the experiment from couple to couple , the UNK of the two persons in a couple probably agree more often than independence would UNK , because UNK who visit the museum together are more likely to have similar UNK than are a random pair of people drawn from the entire population of visitors STOP
START table UNK UNK the point STOP
START the table shows that UNK of the boys and UNK of the girls vote for picture a STOP
START therefore , under independent voting , af or UNK of the UNK would cast two UNK for picture a , and af or UNK would cast two UNK for picture b STOP
START thus in independent voting , af or UNK of the UNK would agree STOP
START but table UNK shows that af or UNK agree , too many for independent voting STOP
START each performance of an UNK binomial experiment results in some whole number from 0 through n as the value of the random variable x , where af STOP
START we want to study the probability function of this random variable STOP
START for example , we are interested in the number of UNK , not which UNK were UNK STOP
START a binomial experiment can produce random variables other than the number of successes STOP
START for example , the UNK gets 5 UNK , but we take his score to be the number of UNK before his first UNK , that is , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ( or 5 , if he gets no UNK ) STOP
START thus we do not score the number of UNK , and the random variable is not the number of successes STOP
START the UNK of p and the independence are the conditions most likely to give trouble in practice STOP
START obviously , very slight changes in p do not change the probabilities much , and a slight lack of independence may not make an UNK difference STOP
START ( for instance , see example 2 of section UNK , on red cards in hands of 5 STOP
START ) on the other hand , even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical phenomenon being studied , the binomial model may still be used as a UNK for comparative purposes ; ; STOP
START that is , we may discuss the phenomenon in terms of its UNK from the binomial model STOP
START to UNK : STOP
START a binomial experiment consists of af independent binomial trials , all with the same probability af of UNK a success STOP
START the outcome of the experiment is x successes STOP
START the random variable x takes the values af with probabilities af or , more briefly af STOP
START we shall find a formula for the probability of exactly x successes for given values of p and n STOP
START when each number of successes x is UNK with its probability of occurrence af , the set of pairs af , is a probability function called a binomial distribution STOP
START the choice of p and n determines the binomial distribution UNK , and different UNK always produce different UNK ( except when af ; ; STOP
START then the number of successes is always 0 ) STOP
START the set of all binomial UNK is called the family of binomial UNK , but in general discussions this expression is often UNK to `` the binomial distribution '' , or even `` the binomial '' when the context is clear STOP
START binomial UNK were treated by james UNK about UNK , and for this reason binomial trials are sometimes called UNK trials STOP
START random variables STOP
START each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produces either 0 or 1 success STOP
START therefore each binomial trial can be thought of as producing a value of a random variable associated with that trial and taking the values 0 and 1 , with probabilities q and p respectively STOP
START the several trials of a binomial experiment produce a new random variable x , the total number of successes , which is just the sum of the random variables associated with the single trials STOP
START example 2 STOP
START the UNK gets two UNK , one on his third shot and one on his fifth STOP
START the numbers of successes on the five individual UNK are , then , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 STOP
START the number of successes on each shot is a value of a random variable that has values 0 or 1 , and there are 5 such random variables here STOP
START their sum is x , the total number of successes , which in this experiment has the value af STOP
START consider a simple , closed , plane curve c which is a UNK image of the unit circle , and which is given by af STOP
START these are real analytic UNK functions with period t STOP
START in the following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of squares can be UNK in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of UNK squares STOP
START this theorem is similar to the theorem of UNK that there exists a UNK UNK around any closed , UNK UNK set in af STOP
START the latter theorem has been UNK by UNK and UNK , and UNK to show that in af there are families of such UNK STOP
START here , for the case of squares UNK in plane curves , we remove the UNK to UNK and give certain other results STOP
START a square UNK in a curve c means a square with its four corner points on the curve , though it may not lie entirely in the interior of c STOP
START indeed , the UNK af , with the two UNK connected by a straight line UNK only one UNK square STOP
START the square has one corner point on the straight line UNK , and does not lie entirely in the interior STOP
START on c , from the point p at af to the point q at af , we construct the UNK , and upon the UNK as a side UNK a square in such a way that as s approaches zero the square is inside c STOP
START as s increases we consider the two free corner points of the square , af and af , UNK to p and q respectively STOP
START as s approaches t the square will be outside c and therefore both af and af must cross c an odd number of times as s UNK from zero to t STOP
START the points may also touch c without UNK STOP
START suppose af UNK c when af STOP
START we now have certain squares with three corners on c STOP
START for any such square the middle corner of these will be called the vertex of the square and the corner not on the curve will be called the UNK point of the square STOP
START each point on c , as a vertex , may possess a UNK number of corresponding UNK points by the above construction STOP
START to each UNK vertex and UNK point there UNK a unique forward corner point , i.e, the corner on c reached first by proceeding along c from the vertex in the direction of increasing t STOP
START if the vertex is at af , and if the interior of c is on the left as one moves in the direction of increasing t , then every such corner can be found from the curve obtained by rotating c UNK through UNK about the vertex STOP
START the set of intersections of af , the UNK curve , with the original curve c consists of just the set of forward corner points on c corresponding to the vertex at af , plus the vertex itself STOP
START we note that two such curves c and af , cannot UNK at more than a UNK number of points ; ; STOP
START otherwise , being analytic , they would UNK at all points , which is impossible since they do not UNK near af STOP
START with each vertex we associate certain numerical values , namely the set of positive differences in the UNK t between the vertex and its corresponding forward corner points STOP
START for the vertex at af , these values will be UNK by af STOP
START the function UNK defined in this way is UNK STOP
START we consider now the graph of the function UNK on af STOP
START we will refer to the plane of c and af as the UNK and to the plane of the graph as the aj STOP
START the graph , as a set , may have a UNK number of components STOP
START we will UNK the values of UNK on different components by af STOP
START each point with UNK t on the graph represents an intersection between c and af STOP
START there are two types of such intersections , depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point of intersection STOP
START an ordinary point will be any point of intersection a such that in every neighborhood of a in the UNK , af meets both the interior and the UNK of c STOP
START any other point of intersection between c and af will be called a tangent point STOP
START this UNK will also be applied to the corresponding points in the aj STOP
START we can now prove several UNK STOP
START UNK 1 STOP
START in some neighborhood in the UNK of any ordinary point of the graph , the function f is a UNK , continuous function STOP
START proof STOP
START we first show that the function is UNK in some neighborhood STOP
START with the vertex at af in the UNK we assume that af is the UNK location on c of an ordinary intersection q between c and af STOP
START in the UNK the UNK of the corresponding point are af STOP
START we know that in the UNK both c and af are analytic STOP
START in the UNK we construct a set of UNK UNK UNK UNK , v with the origin at q and such that both c and af have UNK slope at q STOP
START near q , both curves can be represented by analytic functions of UNK STOP
START in a neighborhood of q the difference between these functions is also a UNK , analytic function of UNK STOP
START furthermore , one can find a neighborhood of q in which the difference function is UNK , for since it is analytic it can have only a UNK number of UNK in any interval STOP
START now , to find af , one needs the intersection of c and af near q STOP
START but af is just the curve af UNK without UNK through a small arc , for af is always obtained by rotating c through exactly UNK STOP
START the arc is itself a UNK of an analytic curve STOP
START thus if e is sufficiently small , there can be only one intersection of c and af near q , for if there were more than one intersection for every e then the difference between c and af near q would not be a UNK function STOP
START therefore , af is UNK near q STOP
START it is also seen that af , since the change from af to af is accomplished by a continuous translation STOP
START thus af is also continuous at af , and in a neighborhood of af which does not contain a tangent point STOP
START we turn now to the set of tangent points on the graph STOP
START this set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals STOP
START the fact that there can not be any limit points of the set except in closed intervals follows from the argument used in UNK 1 , namely , that near any tangent point in the UNK the curves c and af are analytic , and therefore the difference between them must be a UNK function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point STOP
START this UNK the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points STOP
START UNK 2 STOP
START in some neighborhood of an isolated tangent point in the UNK , say af , the function af is either UNK or has no values defined , except at the tangent point itself , where it is UNK STOP
START proof STOP
START a tangent point q in the UNK occurs when c and af are tangent to one another STOP
START a continuous change in t through an amount e results in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve af STOP
START there are three possibilities : ( a ) af remains tangent to c as it is UNK ; ; STOP
START ( b ) af moves away from c and does not UNK it at all for af ; ; STOP
START ( c ) af cuts across c and there are two ordinary intersections for every t in af STOP
START the first possibility results in a closed interval of tangent points in the UNK , the end points of which fall into category ( b ) or ( c ) STOP
START in the second category the function af has no values defined in a neighborhood af STOP
START in the third category the function is UNK in this interval STOP
START the same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of af STOP
START again , the UNK of the two curves UNK that such intervals exist STOP
START in the neighborhood of an end point of an interval of tangent points in the UNK the function is UNK or UNK on one side , and is a UNK function consisting entirely of tangent points on the other side STOP
START with the above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of f STOP
START first , for any value of t for which all values of UNK are ordinary points the number of values of UNK must be odd STOP
START for it is clear that the total number of ordinary intersections of c and af must be even ( otherwise , starting in the interior of c , af could not finally return to the interior ) , and the center of UNK at t is the argument of the function , not a value STOP
START therefore , for any value of t the number of values of UNK is equal to the ( UNK ) number of tangent points corresponding to the argument t plus an odd number STOP
START definition STOP
START the number of ordinary values of the function UNK at t will be called its UNK at t STOP
START UNK 3 STOP
START the graph of f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval aj STOP
START proof STOP
START STOP
START we suppose not STOP
START then every component of the graph of f must be defined over a UNK UNK STOP
START suppose af is defined in the UNK af STOP
START now af and af must both be tangent points on the t component in the UNK ; ; STOP
START otherwise by UNK 1 the component would extend beyond these points STOP
START further , we see by UNK 2 that the UNK of f can only change at a tangent point , and at such a point can only change by an even UNK STOP
START thus the UNK of af for a given t must be an even number STOP
START this is true of all components which have such a UNK support STOP
START but this is a UNK , for we know that the UNK of UNK is odd for every t STOP
START we have shown that the graph of f contains at least one component whose UNK is the entire interval UNK , and whose UNK is odd STOP
START there must be an odd number of such components , which will be called complete components STOP
START the remaining ( incomplete ) components all have an even number of ordinary points at any argument , and are defined only on a proper UNK of aj STOP
START we must now show that on some component of the graph there exist two points for which the corresponding UNK points in the UNK are on opposite sides of c STOP
START we again consider a fixed point p at af and a variable point q at af on c STOP
START we UNK a square with UNK as a side and with free corners af and af UNK to p and q respectively STOP
START as s UNK from zero to t , the values of s for which af and af cross c will be UNK by af and af respectively STOP
START we have af , plus tangent points STOP
START these UNK are just the ordinary values of af STOP
START UNK 4 STOP
START the values af are the ordinary values at af of a UNK function UNK which has components corresponding to those of UNK STOP
START proof STOP
START we first define a function UNK as follows : given the set of squares such that each has three corners on c and vertex at t , UNK is the corresponding set of positive UNK differences between t and the backward corner points STOP
START the functions f and b have exactly the same UNK at every argument t STOP
START now with p fixed at af , UNK occur when the corner af UNK c , and are among the values of s such that af STOP
START the roots of this equation are just the UNK of the intersections of the graph of b with a straight line of unit slope through af in the UNK ( the plane of the graph of b ) STOP
START we define these values as af , and define UNK in the same way for each t STOP
START thus we obtain UNK by UNK an UNK UNK in the aj STOP
START introduction STOP
START in 1 we UNK a new series of line UNK in a UNK space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers STOP
START these are defined by a simple UNK transformation of the points in which a general line meets a UNK UNK surface bearing a curve of symbol af STOP
START then in 2 we show that any line UNK with the properties that ( a ) it has no complex of invariant lines , and ( b ) its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a UNK curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1 STOP
START no UNK of these results to UNK of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible STOP
START 1 STOP
START let q be a UNK UNK surface bearing UNK af and af , and let **zg be a af curve of order UNK on q STOP
START a general line l meets q in two points , af and af , through each of which passes a unique generator of the UNK , af , whose lines are simple secants of aj STOP
START on these UNK let af and af be , respectively , the UNK conjugates of af and af with respect to the two points in which the corresponding generator meets aj STOP
START the line af is the image of l STOP
START clearly , the transformation is UNK STOP
START we observe first that no line , l , can meet its image except at one of its intersections with q STOP
START for if it did , the plane of l and UNK would contain two UNK of af , which is impossible STOP
START moreover , from the UNK transformation of UNK on the UNK of af , it is clear that the only points of q at which a line can meet its image are the points of aj STOP
START hence the UNK of singular lines is the t order complex of lines which meet aj STOP
START the invariant lines are the lines of the congruence of secants of **zg , since each of these meets q in two points which are invariant STOP
START the order of this congruence is af , since af secants of a curve of symbol ( b ) on a UNK surface pass through an arbitrary point STOP
START the class of the congruence is af , since an arbitrary plane meets **zg in UNK points STOP
START since the complex of singular lines is of order UNK and since there is no complex of invariant lines , it follows from the formula af that the order of the UNK is af STOP
START there are various sets of exceptional lines , or lines whose images are not unique STOP
START the most obvious of these is the UNK complex of UNK to q , each line of which is transformed into the entire pencil of lines tangent to q at the image of the point of UNK of the given line STOP
START thus UNK of UNK to q are transformed into UNK of UNK STOP
START it is interesting that a 1 : 1 correspondence can be established between the lines of two such UNK , so that in a sense a unique image can actually be assigned to each tangent STOP
START for the lines of any plane , UNK , meeting q in a UNK c , are transformed into the congruence of secants of the curve UNK into which c is transformed in the point UNK on q STOP
START in particular , UNK to c are transformed into UNK to UNK STOP
START moreover , if af and af are two planes UNK in a line l , tangent to q at a point p , the two free intersections of the image curves af and af must UNK at UNK , the image of p , and at this point af and af must have a common tangent UNK STOP
START hence , thought of as a line in a particular plane UNK , any tangent to q has a unique image and moreover this image is the same for all planes through l STOP
START each generator , UNK , of af is also exceptional , for each is transformed into the entire congruence of secants of the curve into which that generator is transformed by the point UNK on q STOP
START this curve is of symbol af since it meets UNK , and hence every line of af in the af invariant points on UNK and since it obviously meets every line of af in a single point STOP
START the congruence of its secants is therefore of order af and class af STOP
START a final class of exceptional lines is UNK from the following considerations : since no two UNK of af can UNK , it follows that their image curves can have no free intersections STOP
START in other words , these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all STOP
START now the only way in which all curves of the image family of af can pass through a fixed point is to have a generator of af which is not a secant but a tangent of **zg , for then any point on such a generator will be transformed into the point of UNK STOP
START since two curves of symbol af on q UNK in af points , it follows that there are af lines of af which are tangent to aj STOP
START clearly , any line , l , of any UNK having one of these points of UNK , t , as vertex will be transformed into the entire pencil having the image of the second intersection of l and q as vertex and lying in the plane determined by the image point and the generator of af which is tangent to **zg at t STOP
START a line through two of these points , af and af , will be transformed into the entire UNK congruence having the UNK to **zg at af and af as UNK STOP
START a UNK , c , being a ( 1 , 1 ) curve on q , meets the image of any line of af , which we have already found to be a af curve on q , in af points STOP
START hence its image , UNK , meets any line of af in af points STOP
START moreover , UNK obviously meets any line af in a single point STOP
START hence UNK is a af curve on q STOP
START therefore , the congruence of its secants , that is the image of a general plane field of lines , is of order af and class af STOP
START finally , the image of a general UNK of lines is a congruence whose order is the order of the congruence of invariant lines , namely af and whose class is the order of the image congruence of a general plane field of lines , namely af STOP
START 2 STOP
START the preceding observations make it clear that there exist line UNK of all orders greater than 1 with no complex of invariant lines and with a complex of singular lines consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a UNK curve aj STOP
START we now shall show that any UNK with these characteristics is necessarily of the type we have just described STOP
START to do this we must first show that every line which meets **zg in a point p meets its image at p STOP
START to see this , consider a general pencil of lines containing a general secant of aj STOP
START by ( 1 ) , the image of this pencil is a ruled surface of order af which is met by the plane of the pencil in a curve , c , of order af STOP
START on c there is a af correspondence in which the af points cut from c by a general line , l , of the pencil UNK to the point of intersection of the image of l and the plane of the pencil STOP
START since c is rational , this correspondence has UNK UNK , each of which implies a line of the pencil which meets its image STOP
START however , since the pencil contains a secant of **zg it actually contains only af singular lines STOP
START to avoid this UNK it is necessary that c be UNK , with the secant of **zg and a curve of order af as components STOP
START thus it follows that the secants of **zg are all invariant STOP
START but if this is the case , then an arbitrary pencil of lines having a point , p , of **zg as vertex is transformed into a ruled surface of order af having af UNK UNK at p STOP
START since a ruled surface of order n with n UNK UNK is necessarily a cone , it follows finally that every line through a point , p , of **zg meets its image at p , as asserted STOP
START now consider the transformation of the lines of a UNK with vertex , p , on **zg which is UNK by the UNK as a whole STOP
START from the preceding remarks , it is clear that such a UNK is transformed into itself in an UNK fashion STOP
START moreover , in this UNK there is a cone of invariant lines of order af , namely the cone of secants of **zg which pass through p STOP
START hence it follows that the UNK within the UNK must be a perspective de UNK UNK of order af and the invariant UNK must have a multiple line of UNK either af or af STOP
START the first possibility requires that there be a line through p which meets **zg in af points ; ; STOP
START the second requires that there be a line through p which meets **zg in af points STOP
START in each case , lines of the UNK are transformed by UNK within the UNK they determine with the multiple secant STOP
START in the first case the fixed elements within each pencil are the multiple secant and the line UNK the vertex , p , to the intersection of **zg and the plane of the pencil which does not lie on the multiple secant STOP
START in the second , the fixed elements are the lines which join the vertex , p , to the two intersections of **zg and the plane of the pencil which do not lie on the multiple secant STOP
START the multiple secants , of course , are exceptional and in each case are transformed into UNK of order af STOP
START observations similar to these can be made at each point of aj STOP
START hence **zg must have either a UNK of UNK secants or a UNK of UNK secants STOP
START moreover , if af , no two of the multiple secants can UNK STOP
START for if such were the case , either the plane of the two lines would meet **zg in more than UNK points or , UNK , the order of the image UNK of the pencil determined by the two lines would be too high STOP
START but if no two lines of the UNK of multiple secants of **zg can UNK , then the UNK must be UNK , or in other words , **zg must be either a af or a af curve on a UNK UNK surface STOP
START we now observe that the case in which **zg is a af curve on a UNK is impossible if the complex of singular lines consists exclusively of the lines which meet aj STOP
START for any pencil in a plane containing a UNK secant of **zg has an image UNK which meets the plane of the pencil in af lines , namely the images of the lines of the pencil which pass through the intersection of **zg and the multiple secant , plus an additional component to account for the intersections of the images of the general lines of the pencil STOP
START however , if there is no additional complex of singular lines , the order of the image UNK of a pencil is precisely af STOP
START this UNK the preceding observations , and so , under the assumption of this paper , we must UNK the possibility that **zg is a af curve on a UNK surface STOP
START continuing with the case in which **zg is a af curve on a UNK q , we first observe that the second UNK of q consists precisely of the lines which join the two free intersections of **zg and the planes through any one of the multiple secants STOP
START for each of these lines meets q in three points , namely two points on **zg and one point on one of the multiple secants STOP
START now consider an arbitrary line , l , meeting q in two points , af and af STOP
START if UNK is the multiple secant of **zg which passes through af and UNK is the simple secant of **zg which passes through af , and if af are the points in which UNK meets **zg , and if af is the image of af on the generator UNK , it follows that the image of the line af is af STOP
START these societies can expect to face difficult times STOP
START as the historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum , their UNK will be threatened by UNK forces , the UNK between UNK and subjects , town and country , will UNK ; ; STOP
START new UNK for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence ; ; STOP
START old UNK may lose their UNK and their sense of direction STOP
START national leaders will have to display the highest skills of UNK to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy UNK sense of identity STOP
START feelings of a community of interest will have to be UNK -- in some of the new nations , indeed , they must be built for the first time -- on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not UNK only on shared UNK of the past STOP
START nevertheless , with UNK and careful planning , some of the more UNK and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing through this stage can be UNK STOP
START the united states can help by UNK a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible STOP
START our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive UNK for these societies to UNK UNK the tasks which they face STOP
START at the same time , we should recognize that the UNK to change and the lack of UNK and stability which UNK these countries may make them particularly UNK to UNK and external UNK of all UNK STOP
START it may seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less UNK by fishing in the UNK waters of international politics than by facing up to the UNK tasks at home STOP
START we should do what we can to UNK this conclusion , both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by UNK firmly to UNK actions on the world scene STOP
START when necessary , we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold war or to UNK their potential for UNK the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for UNK development STOP
START as a nation , we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development ; ; STOP
START but this obligation UNK only to countries which are UNK seeking to become responsible members of a stable and UNK world community STOP
START UNK societies STOP
START when we look at countries like UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK , where substantial progress has been made in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social UNK capital , and where institutions of UNK government exist , we find a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence different UNK for policy STOP
START the men in power are committed in principle to modernization , but economic and social changes are proceeding only UNK STOP
START isolated enterprises have been launched , but they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern STOP
START the society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly UNK urban sector and a relatively UNK rural sector , with very poor communications between the two STOP
START progress is UNK by psychological UNK to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resources , human and material , can be UNK to achieve the national goals of modernization already UNK accepted STOP
START most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective STOP
START in these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals STOP
START the colonial period has generally left people UNK that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of services for them -- and that with independence free men do not have to work to realize the benefits of modern life STOP
START for example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most UNK societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; ; STOP
START such is the UNK of planning that people expect that UNK of the plan will follow automatically upon its UNK STOP
START the civil services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal UNK with the problems facing them ; ; STOP
START and their members often UNK a government career with security and status rather than with sacrifice , UNK , and competence STOP
START american policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their UNK there is not the UNK hope that they will either UNK of UNK their societies STOP
START we should spread the view that planning and national development are serious matters which call for effort as well as enthusiasm STOP
START above all , we should seek to encourage the leaders of these societies to accept the UNK fact that they are responsible for their UNK STOP
START only within the UNK of a mature relationship characterized by honest UNK of performance can we provide telling assistance STOP
START with respect to those countries whose leaders prefer to live with their UNK , we can afford to wait , for in time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see STOP
START our technical assistance to these countries should place special emphasis on UNK the central governments to assume the role of UNK and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts assumed in dealing with the central governments STOP
START we should encourage the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities , state and UNK governments , rural communities , and other smaller groups , making certain that no important UNK of the economy is UNK STOP
START simultaneously we should be UNK the UNK of technical progress in various fields , showing how agricultural training can be introduced into education , how health affects labor productivity , how small business can benefit the rural farm community , and , above all , how progress in each field UNK to national progress STOP
START efforts such as the community development program in the UNK have demonstrated that UNK societies can work toward balanced national development STOP
START to achieve this goal of balanced development , communications between the central government and the local communities must be such that the needs and aspirations of the people themselves are effectively taken into account STOP
START if modernization programs are imposed from above , without the understanding and cooperation of the people , they will encounter grave difficulties STOP
START land reform is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries STOP
START it should be american policy not only to encourage effective land reform programs but also to UNK the relation of such UNK to the economic growth and modernization of the society STOP
START as an isolated policy , land reform is likely to be UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START as part of a larger development effort , however , it may gain wide acceptance STOP
START it should also be recognized that the problem of rural UNK cannot be solved by administrative UNK alone STOP
START land reform programs need to be UNK with programs for promoting rural UNK and technical assistance in agriculture STOP
START UNK , governmental and private UNK will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements UNK ahead STOP
START by holding out prospects for external capital assistance , the united states can provide strong UNK to prepare for the UNK economic drive necessary to achieve UNK growth STOP
START UNK UNK societies STOP
START at a third stage in the modernization process are such countries as india , UNK , the UNK , and UNK , which are ready and committed to move into the stage of UNK growth STOP
START they must continue to satisfy basic capital needs ; ; STOP
START and there UNK the UNK problem of maintaining operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously UNK participation in the program to wider and wider groups STOP
START but these countries have made big UNK toward developing the necessary human and social UNK capital ; ; STOP
START they have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local levels ; ; STOP
START and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal UNK and simultaneously with all the major UNK of their UNK STOP
START on the economic front , the first UNK of these countries is to UNK a UNK increased volume of resources STOP
START several related tasks must be carried out if UNK growth is to be achieved STOP
START these countries must UNK a comprehensive , long-term program covering the objectives of both the private and the public UNK of the economy STOP
START they must in their planning be able to count on at least UNK commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods of several years STOP
START capital UNK drawn from a number of sources must be employed and combined UNK enough to permit domestic investment UNK to go forward STOP
START capital UNK must be coordinated with national needs and planning STOP
START finally , a balance must be UNK among project finance , UNK of agricultural UNK , and general balance of payments support STOP
START thus , although the UNK of external assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative , and many of the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant , the basic purpose of american economic policy during the later stages of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of UNK growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange STOP
START there remain many political and administrative problems to be solved STOP
START for one thing , although considerable numbers of men have been trained , UNK are still UNK in many respects ; ; STOP
START even the UNK indian civil service is not fully adequate to the tremendous range of tasks it has undertaken STOP
START technical assistance in training UNK and UNK management personnel is still needed in many cases STOP
START there are also more basic problems STOP
START this is the stage at which democratic developments must take place if the society is to become an open community of creative people STOP
START nevertheless , UNK still exist among the ruling UNK to UNK and thus to UNK the need for UNK and UNK practices STOP
START another great danger is that the emerging middle class will feel itself increasingly UNK from the political leaders who still justify their UNK by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism STOP
START the capacity of UNK and members of the new professional classes to contribute UNK to national development is likely to be destroyed by a UNK sense of UNK toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts in the west STOP
START particularly when based upon a single dominant party , governments may respond to such a situation by UNK a UNK of understanding about the national interest STOP
START convinced of the wisdom of their own actions , and UNK by the UNK of their economic development programs , governments may fail to push UNK to win more and more people to the national effort , becoming instead more rigid and UNK in their policies STOP
START american policy toward such societies should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional classes STOP
START it should attempt to UNK both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and UNK of UNK open and UNK societies STOP
START we have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries ; ; STOP
START we also have , in consequence , the duty to UNK UNK and UNK their performance and to UNK our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways STOP
START the time factor STOP
START we have emphasized that the UNK process in each society will take a considerable period of time STOP
START with the exception of UNK , foreign relations were historically concerned for the most part with conditions of short or at least UNK UNK STOP
START foreign policy now takes on a different perspective and must become skilled not merely at response but also at UNK STOP
START american and UNK policies can UNK affect the pace of transition ; ; STOP
START but basically that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources and in the human attitudes , political institutions , and social structure which each society must UNK STOP
START it follows that any effective policy toward the UNK countries must have a UNK long working horizon STOP
START it must be marked by a patience and UNK which have not always been its UNK STOP
START this condition affects not only the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign policy , especially in the context of economic aid STOP
START 2 : : STOP
START some of the major functions of religion STOP
START the place of religion in the simple , UNK societies is quite definite ; ; STOP
START as a complex it UNK into the whole social organization and functions UNK in every part of it STOP
START in societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex STOP
START with the diversity of religious UNK , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; STOP
START and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion STOP
START nevertheless , for most of the population of UNK advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain UNK individual and social functions STOP
START although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences STOP
START if the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , UNK , and UNK secure associate ; ; STOP
START he is not greatly UNK , and he is not UNK ; ; STOP
START he is better UNK to perform his social life among his fellows STOP
START there are several closely related inner functions STOP
START in the last analysis , religion is the means of UNK , UNK , expressing , UNK , UNK , and UNK man's UNK experience -- the religious STOP
START man is first religious ; ; STOP
START the UNK follow STOP
START religion UNK to satisfy human needs of great UNK STOP
START the significant things in it , at the higher religious levels , are the inner emotional , mental , and spiritual UNK that fill the pressing human needs of UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START the chief experience is the UNK of UNK , and in the higher religions , of a UNK relationship with the supernatural power STOP
START related to this is the fact that most of the higher religions define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively secure in an ordered , UNK universe STOP
START man has the experience of being UNK UNK with what he cannot fully understand ; ; STOP
START he is a UNK part of all of the mysterious energy and being and movement STOP
START the universe is a safe and permanent home STOP
START a number of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the ultimate and eternal STOP
START death is not permanent defeat and UNK ; ; STOP
START man has a second chance STOP
START he is not lost in the UNK of UNK time ; ; STOP
START he has UNK being STOP
START religion at its best also offers the experience of spiritual UNK by UNK man into the highest realm of the spirit STOP
START religion can UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK all the highest ideals and values -- ethical , aesthetic , and religious -- of man formed in his culture STOP
START there is also the possibility , among higher religions , of UNK consistent meaning in life and UNK guidance and UNK STOP
START the kind of religious experience that most UNK seek not only provides , UNK , and UNK human UNK , values , ideals , and purposes ; ; STOP
START it also provides facilities and UNK for the development of personality , UNK , and UNK STOP
START under the religious UNK , whether UNK or UNK , men have joy in living ; ; STOP
START life leads UNK STOP
START religion at its best is out in front , ever UNK and leading on , and , as UNK put it , `` UNK all man's scattered energies in one UNK sense of his own infinite importance '' STOP
START at the same time that religion UNK the individual UNK to the supernatural and gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme UNK , it also has great therapeutic value for him STOP
START it gives him aid , comfort , even UNK , in meeting UNK life situations where his own UNK practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate STOP
START he is confronted with the UNK crises , such as great natural UNK and the great UNK of life -- marriage , UNK disease , UNK , old age , the certainty of death STOP
START he has to cope with UNK and other emotional UNK and UNK STOP
START his religious beliefs provide him with UNK UNK for many conditions which cause him great concern , and his religious faith makes possible UNK , UNK , and UNK , UNK him to UNK UNK UNK , fear , UNK , uncertainty , suffering , evil , and danger STOP
START religion usually also includes a principle of compensation , mainly in a promised perfect future state STOP
START the belief in immortality , where held , functions as a UNK for the UNK and UNK of the here and now STOP
START the tensions accompanying a UNK consciousness of UNK or UNK or some UNK secret are relieved for the less UNK or UNK by UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START the feeling of individual UNK , defeat , or UNK growing out of various social situations or individual UNK or UNK is UNK for by UNK in worship or prayer with a friendly , but UNK UNK , as well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith , and by opportunities in religious acts for giving UNK to emotions and energies STOP
START in providing for these inner individual functions , religion UNK in behalf of individual peace of mind and UNK services for which there is no other institution STOP
START in addition to the functions of religion within man , there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society STOP
START the two have never been UNK STOP
START religion is UNK necessary in both UNK maintenance and regulation STOP
START the UNK of a community or society is always UNK with , and to a degree dependent upon , a more or less shared system of religious beliefs and convictions STOP
START the religion UNK , UNK , UNK , and maintains the fundamental values STOP
START even in the united states , with its freedom of religious belief and worship and its vast UNK UNK , there is a general UNK regarding the basic christian values STOP
START this is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of UNK different value orientation elsewhere ; ; STOP
START for example americans UNK to christian values UNK those of UNK communism STOP
START in america also all of our major religious bodies UNK UNK a UNK UNK which is UNK of our common religion STOP
START even the UNK members -- the UNK , marginal UNK and so on -- have the values of christian civilization UNK in them STOP
START furthermore , religion tends to UNK the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of god to the UNK and UNK values ; ; STOP
START for example , those regarding material objects and UNK ends STOP
START finally , it gives UNK , more than human UNK , and even , through UNK reference , UNK and supernatural importance to some values ; ; STOP
START for example , marriage as a UNK , much UNK as UNK , occasionally the state as a divine instrument STOP
START it places certain values at least beyond UNK and UNK STOP
START closely related to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society , which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends STOP
START this something leads to a conception of an over-all social plan with a meaning UNK in terms of ultimate ends ; ; STOP
START for example , a plan that UNK the will of god , which advances the kingdom of god , which involves social life as part of the grand design STOP
START this explains some group ends and provides a justification of their UNK STOP
START it gives social guidance and direction and makes for programs of social action STOP
START finally , it gives meaning to much social UNK , and UNK , consistency , and meaning to life STOP
START in general , there is no society so UNK as to be completely without UNK inspired UNK ends STOP
START religion UNK and UNK STOP
START some of the UNK , most persistent , and most cohesive forms of social UNK have grown out of religion STOP
START these groups have varied widely from mere families , primitive , UNK groups , and small modern UNK and UNK , to the UNK of great denominations , and great , widely UNK world religions STOP
START religion UNK group life in various ways STOP
START the common ultimate values , ends and goals UNK by religion are a most important factor STOP
START without a system of values there can be no society STOP
START where such a value system UNK , it always UNK all who possess it ; ; STOP
START it UNK members of the society to operate as a system STOP
START the beliefs of a religion also UNK the values are expressed in UNK , UNK , and UNK , and form what UNK calls a UNK STOP
START as he points out , a religious group cannot exist without a collective UNK , and the more extensive the UNK , the more UNK and strong is the group STOP
START the UNK UNK and UNK men by UNK them completely to an identical body of doctrine ; ; STOP
START the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine , the UNK the group STOP
START the religious UNK , and especially the closely related UNK and worship forms , constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith STOP
START the religion , in fact , is an expression of the unity of the group , small or large STOP
START the common codes , for religious action as such and in their ethical aspects for UNK moral behavior , UNK the UNK together STOP
START these are ways of UNK UNK in significantly UNK , UNK , and ordered UNK UNK behavior STOP
START the codes are mechanism for training in , and UNK and UNK , uniform social interaction , and for continually and publicly UNK the UNK of the group STOP
START UNK noted long ago that religion as `` a UNK system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things UNK into one single moral community all those who UNK to them '' STOP
START his view is that every religion UNK to a community , and , UNK , every community is in one aspect a religious unit STOP
START this is brought out in the common religious UNK that UNK even in the UNK diverse audiences at many secular UNK and public occasions in the united states ; ; STOP
START and it is evidenced in the prayers offered , in the frequent religious UNK , and in the UNK of points on religious grounds STOP
START the UNK effect of religion is also brought out in the fact that historically peoples have UNK together as more or less cohesive cultural units , with religion as the dominant bond , even though UNK UNK and not UNK organized STOP
START the jews for UNK years have been a prime example , though the UNK of any world or UNK religion are cases in point STOP
START it might be pointed out that the UNK function of religion , for good or ill , has often supported or been identified with other UNK -- political , UNK , language , class , racial , UNK , even economic STOP
START religion usually exercises a UNK function STOP
START as such it acts as an UNK for the people STOP
START there is a marked tendency for religions , once firmly established , to resist change , not only in their own UNK and policies and practices , but also in secular affairs having religious UNK STOP
START it has thus been a significant factor in the UNK of social values , though also in some measure , an UNK to the creation or diffusion of new ones STOP
START it tends to support the UNK precious UNK , the traditional ways of thinking , and the UNK ways of living STOP
START as UNK has pointed out , the `` UNK on symbols , on tradition , on sacred writings , on the UNK of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values , turns one to the past far more than to the future '' STOP
START historically , religion has also UNK as a tremendous engine of UNK , enforcement , UNK , and UNK of various other institutions STOP
START at the same time that religion exercises a UNK influence , it also UNK and UNK both individuals and groups STOP
START much of the important individual and social action has been UNK to religious UNK STOP
START the great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent UNK lights that UNK people toward them with an almost UNK force , UNK energies and UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START for example , the UNK , mission efforts , just wars STOP
START much effort has been UNK in the UNK effort to apply the teaching and UNK of religion STOP
START the UNK UNK systems that most religions UNK have great UNK effects STOP
START religion provides the most attractive UNK , either in this world or the next , for those who not merely UNK by its norms , but who UNK in good works STOP
START religion usually acts as a powerful aid in social control , UNK what men should or should not do STOP
START among primitive peoples the UNK and UNK of religion were more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the group ; ; STOP
START and in modern societies such influence is still great STOP
START religion has its own supernatural UNK that are at the same time codes of behavior for the here and now STOP
START UNK with the care of five young children and concerned about persistent economic difficulties due to her UNK marginal income , her defense of denial was UNK strong STOP
START thus the lack of effective recognition of the responsibilities involved in UNK for two UNK showed signs of becoming a UNK problem STOP
START the result , UNK visible in a matter of days in the UNK UNK daily UNK , was a UNK fear that some terrible UNK would UNK the second UNK , whose birth had not been UNK STOP
START soon UNK fears threatened to burst into a UNK UNK concerning the welfare of the entire family STOP
START inability to care for the other children , difficulty in feeding the UNK , who seemed UNK , UNK UNK , repeated UNK UNK , and short UNK reflected the UNK UNK in UNK with the UNK situation STOP
START clearly , this was a family in crisis STOP
START UNK her feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and UNK at the time of her mother's death when she was eight , as well as her subsequent anger at her father for UNK STOP
START her previous UNK experiences UNK through her mind as if they had happened UNK STOP
START on the anniversary of her father's death she poured out with UNK tears her feelings of guilt about not having attended his UNK STOP
START in the UNK own words ( during the third of twelve visits ) , they had `` reached the crisis peak -- either the situation will give or we will break '' ! ! STOP
START direct UNK and acceptance of UNK anger against the second baby soon UNK her fears of UNK STOP
START UNK of her anxiety and guilt concerning the death of her parents , when linked up with her current feelings of anger and her fears of loss , UNK , and UNK , produced further relief of tension STOP
START in a joint interview UNK UNK helped to understand the meaning of a younger UNK UNK away from home in terms of his feelings of displacement in reaction to the arrival of the UNK STOP
START the father , accurately UNK the child's needs , not only UNK them as worthy of his attention , but immediately satisfied them by taking him on his UNK along with the UNK , saying , `` i have a big UNK ; ; STOP
START there is room for you , too , UNK '' STOP
START simultaneously , a variety of UNK UNK -- a calm but not too UNK UNK , UNK for temporary economic aid , UNK use of UNK care , UNK to the UNK UNK for medical advice on the UNK feeding problem -- combined to prevent further development of UNK UNK mechanisms STOP
START UNK visits of the UNK and social worker indicated continued success in the care of the new UNK as well as a marked improvement in the UNK UNK mental health and social UNK STOP
START as seen in the UNK , there must be an attempt to help the UNK develop conscious awareness of the problem , especially in the absence of a formal request for assistance STOP
START the lack of awareness usually springs from deep but UNK anxiety , often assuming the UNK UNK of `` not knowing '' or `` not UNK '' STOP
START the UNK use of denial in the initial reaction to a stress must be handled through the medium of a positive controlled UNK STOP
START in general , the approach is more active than UNK , more UNK than UNK STOP
START while some UNK is inevitable , it is discouraged rather than encouraged so that the UNK does not follow the stages of planned UNK associated with certain casework UNK of the UNK model for insight therapy STOP
START to establish an UNK meaningful relationship the worker must demonstrate actual or potential UNK immediately , preferably within the first interview , by meeting the UNK specific needs STOP
START these needs usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension STOP
START the initial interview must be therapeutic rather than purely UNK in an UNK sense STOP
START in this UNK stage the worker must UNK confidence in the UNK ability to deal with the problem STOP
START in so doing he UNK offers the positive UNK of hope as a kind of UNK dynamic to UNK feelings of UNK and UNK generally associated with the first stages of stress impact STOP
START thus , the UNK receives enough UNK support to UNK in UNK efforts on his own behalf STOP
START here there is a specific preventive component which applies in a more UNK sense to any casework situation STOP
START we are UNK or UNK UNK phenomena such as UNK UNK , UNK UNK and UNK , excessive use of denial , and UNK guilt turned against the self STOP
START while some UNK and some denial are not only necessary but healthy , the UNK clinical knowledge must determine how these UNK are being used , what healthy shifts in UNK UNK are indicated , and when efforts at bringing about change can be most effectively UNK STOP
START in UNK the family toward UNK and away from UNK responses , the worker uses UNK UNK casework techniques of specific emotional support , UNK , and UNK guidance STOP
START over a relatively short period of time , usually about four to twelve weeks , the worker must be able to shift the focus , back and forth , between immediate external UNK UNK ( `` UNK stress '' ) and the key , UNK relevant issues ( `` underlying problem '' ) which are , often in a dramatic UNK UNK , UNK by the crisis situation , and hence once again UNK to resolution STOP
START though there is obviously nothing new about these techniques , they do challenge the UNK skill to UNK them precisely on the spot and on the basis of quick and accurate UNK UNK STOP
START then , too , the UNK clinical flexibility is necessary in UNK UNK carefully UNK UNK home visits , single and group office interviews , and appropriate telephone UNK calls , if the worker is to be UNK UNK and if the UNK UNK outcome is to be actually UNK in accordance with the principles of preventive intervention STOP
START in addition , in many cases , a variety of concrete social resources -- UNK , day care , medical and financial aid -- must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to UNK the family in its individual and collective UNK and UNK efforts STOP
START at certain critical stages , and only for sound UNK reasons , it may be important to UNK family members in their use of these resources if their UNK behavior is to be UNK rather than UNK STOP
START while expensive in time and involving a great deal of UNK on the part of the worker ( in terms of his UNK to leave the UNK of his office and enter UNK into the UNK life ) , techniques of UNK were found to be of tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objectives STOP
START finally , whatever the techniques used , a UNK goal is common to all preventive casework service : to UNK or reduce the force of the stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family members to UNK and use their UNK UNK STOP
START having UNK an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework , we now address ourselves to our final question : what place should brief , UNK preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of services ? ? STOP
START we should first recognize our tendency to develop a UNK of values , locating brief treatment at the bottom and long-term intensive service at the top , instead of seeing the services as part of a UNK , each important in its own right STOP
START this problem is perhaps as old as social casework itself STOP
START almost three decades ago UNK UNK UNK a study of UNK UNK because of her conviction that short-term casework had an important but UNK place in our network of social services STOP
START her conclusion has been UNK out in the experience of many UNK : `` UNK UNK is neither a UNK nor a UNK experience but is of the same essential quality as the so-called intensive case work '' STOP
START thus , casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be regarded in terms of the quality of service rendered rather than of the quantity of time UNK STOP
START that we are UNK an UNK of interest in the many formulations and preventive UNK of brief treatment in social casework is evident from even a small sampling of current literature STOP
START especially UNK is UNK finding that the length of treatment per UNK is not a reliable UNK of successful outcome STOP
START according to a number of studies , the important UNK are the nature and management of the UNK anxiety as well as the UNK of the helping person STOP
START for example , the level of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of immediate treatment for UNK relationship problems compared favorably with the results reported by typical child guidance UNK where the hours spent in purely UNK study may equal or exceed the number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental project STOP
START of startling significance , too , is the UNK that it was possible to carry out this program with only a 6 percent UNK rate as compared with a rate of UNK percent reported for a comparable group of families who were receiving help in UNK operated child guidance services STOP
START these reports refer to a level of secondary prevention in a child guidance UNK approached by the UNK route of voluntary UNK by the family or by other professional people STOP
START UNK to the approach which i have described are evident in the UNK establishment of a helping relationship , quick UNK of key issues , and the immediate UNK of treatment plans as the essential UNK in helping to further the UNK UNK efforts in dealing with the UNK of inner and outer stresses STOP
START while there are many different possibilities for the UNK of casework intervention , the experiments recently reported from a variety of traditional UNK all point up the importance of an immediate response to the UNK initial need for help STOP
START in some programs , treatment is concentrated over a short period of time , while in others , after the initial contact is established , flexible UNK of interviews has been UNK used with apparent success STOP
START UNK to take the risk of early and direct interpretation ( with the UNK that if the interpretation is too threatening , the worker can UNK ) is another prominent feature in these efforts STOP
START my aim in UNK this factor obviously is not to give license to `` wild therapy '' but rather to encourage us to use the UNK clinical casework skills we already possess , and to use them with greater confidence , precision , and professional pride STOP
START though there is obviously great need for continued experimentation with various types of short-term intervention to further efforts in developing an operational definition of prevention at the secondary -- or perhaps , in some instances , primary -- level , the place of short-term intervention has already been UNK by a number of investigators in a wide variety of UNK STOP
START UNK , for example , has emphasized the `` need for a broad spectrum of services , including very brief services in connection with critical situations '' STOP
START UNK , brief treatment should be arrived at as a treatment of choice rather than as a treatment of chance STOP
START moreover , the UNK of treatment resources and the UNK persistent UNK of mental health manpower force us to UNK additional UNK of preventive intervention techniques to make services more widely available -- and on a more effective basis to more people STOP
START further research in the meaning of crises as experienced by the UNK of traditional social casework services -- including attempts to develop a UNK of family structures , crisis problems , reaction mechanisms , and differential treatment approaches -- and the establishment of new experimental programs are UNK social needs which should command the best efforts of UNK in UNK with community UNK STOP
START our literature is already UNK with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive agency UNK ranging from the immediately practical to the UNK utopian STOP
START probably , in the immediate future , we will have to settle for UNK efforts that fall short of utopian models STOP
START increased experimentation with UNK agencies , especially those that combine UNK the traditional functions of family and child welfare services , holds rich promise for the future STOP
START for example , child welfare experience UNK with cases in which the UNK request for substitute care is UNK by a crisis event which is UNK linked with a fundamental UNK problem of family relationships STOP
START sentiment STOP
START tension management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the UNK of the element of sentiment or feeling STOP
START one of the devices for tension management is UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study STOP
START the relative geographical isolation of the UNK population makes for a limited choice in UNK STOP
START it would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society STOP
START the UNK relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation STOP
START the UNK building homes on the same land with either set of parents , and the almost exclusive use of members of the population as UNK for UNK and UNK illustrate this UNK relationship STOP
START as UNK remarks , `` in the internal pattern the chief reason for UNK is to UNK UNK , friendship , and love among those who stand in supporting relations to one another and corresponding negative UNK to those who stand in UNK relations '' STOP

START maintenance of the status UNK might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population today STOP
START yet , the object of the element of achieving through the process of goal UNK for this population appears to have been changed by circumstances brought about by the war STOP
START prior to world war 2 , there was a higher percentage of UNK marriages than after world war 2 STOP
START norms STOP
START the norms , as elements , refer to `` all UNK for UNK the character or conduct of both individual and group actions in any social system '' STOP
START the process of evaluation UNK varying positive and negative UNK or values to elements STOP
START the elements and processes become evident in a study of mate selection in this population STOP
START from the evidence `` it may be UNK that core - core marriages are the preferred UNK for core males and females ; ; STOP
START core - marginal marriages still belong in the category of UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START and core - negro marriages are UNK for core members '' STOP
START UNK STOP
START the element of UNK and associated processes have not been sufficiently investigated for this population to permit any type of UNK about them STOP
START power STOP
START there is some indication from a limited number of interviews with members of the population that the element of power , primarily the voluntary influence of UNK power , has been exerted on UNK in the system , particularly in regard to mate selection STOP
START this would seem to vary from family to family , depending somewhat on the core or marginal `` status '' of that family STOP
START again , size of the group may have some influence on the strength of group controls STOP
START UNK STOP
START interviews with members of the UNK population were attempted in order to discover the UNK of the various families in the population STOP
START the large majority of the UNK placed core families in the upper positions STOP
START UNK considers UNK a product of the evaluation process STOP
START `` the standing or rank of an UNK in a given social system is determined by the evaluation placed upon the UNK and his acts in accordance with the norms and standards of the system '' STOP
START despite the increasing rate of UNK marriages , the population has been able to UNK , at least to some degree , the consciousness of its intermediate status in society STOP
START to some extent the system can be considered a UNK in which `` UNK UNK are determined by birth , by attributes such as sex or UNK , which are UNK or UNK UNK '' STOP
START the UNK of many in the population to the indian background in their UNK , and emphasis upon the fact that their UNK had never been slaves , becomes of prime interest in determining how far these elements promote the UNK of the intermediate status of the group in society STOP
START UNK STOP
START the negative UNK applied to core - negro marriages for core members act as UNK of expected UNK to group norms STOP
START however , because of church laws , UNK more UNK enforced , which UNK the marriage of UNK closely related UNK , a means of UNK the goal of UNK relations may be that of UNK to UNK UNK STOP
START a UNK survey of available material indicates a high rate of UNK UNK occurring to parents who have a close UNK relationship STOP
START UNK STOP
START the comprehensive or master processes UNK all or some of the elements within the social system and UNK STOP
START within the larger social system are the structural and functional UNK STOP
START the structural UNK , consisting of relatively stable UNK among its parts , includes : 1 STOP
START UNK of various types , UNK by UNK norms STOP
START 2 STOP
START roles of various types , within the larger system and within the UNK 3 STOP
START UNK norms governing UNK and roles STOP
START 4 STOP
START cultural values STOP
START in the study of marriage patterns for this group , UNK produces the structural system -- a system of UNK -- which , in turn , maintains the system of UNK STOP
START UNK of various types have been found within this system STOP
START each family line can be considered a UNK STOP
START there seems to be an implied cultural value attached to the fact of core status within the group STOP
START UNK , the UNK of core - negro marriages for core families , discussed above , would seem to act as a UNK UNK governing UNK and roles STOP
START the scope of this study does not provide for the study of roles of various types within the larger system or within the UNK STOP
START however , it cannot be UNK , UNK though the structure of the population seems , that there are not UNK roles within the system STOP
START the present study UNK to the theory of functional systems STOP
START it is UNK that UNK is a function of the social system when the population as a whole is considered and a function of the UNK when the UNK division of core families and marginal families is considered STOP
START the four functional problems of a social system are , to some extent , solved by the UNK within this population STOP
START by means of geographical isolation and high UNK rates , UNK can be UNK and the pattern of isolation from the greater society maintained STOP
START in order to attain the goal of group UNK and to UNK tension , the high UNK rate provides more group members for mate selection , and the UNK of members in groups UNK acceptance of group controls STOP
START to maintain their intermediate position in the larger society , it is not only necessary that members of this population be `` visible '' , but that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate , distinct UNK or system in society STOP
START as mentioned above , where families are concentrated in larger numbers , group controls seem strongest and most effective STOP
START UNK to the social and UNK environment through the economy has been met to a degree through a type of occupational UNK STOP
START this provides the necessary contact with the larger society , while supporting a type of control over members in terms of social contacts STOP
START integration `` has to do with the UNK of parts '' STOP
START the problem of UNK and UNK again involves the concept of values STOP
START the values placed by the UNK population , upon maintaining a certain UNK , a certain separate racial identity , and therefore a certain separate social status , are important for the UNK of the system STOP
START since UNK is closely related to pattern maintenance and integration , the higher the UNK and UNK , the better the system can solve the problems of the system STOP
START in this respect it would seem that the greater the social distance between the UNK population and the white and negro UNK within the same general UNK , the greater the possibility for higher UNK and UNK within the UNK population STOP
START it is conceived that one of the means to attain this social distance is that of physical and social isolation STOP
START in turn , higher UNK rates for this population provide a means of increasing the numerical quantity of the population , allowing for the possibility of greater stability and unity STOP
START the population can thereby UNK itself and actually grow larger STOP
START master processes STOP
START of particular utility in the analysis of the development , UNK , and change of social systems has been the use of the master or comprehensive processes STOP
START UNK considers six such processes in his UNK STOP
START 1 STOP
START communication STOP
START 2 STOP
START boundary maintenance STOP
START 3 STOP
START UNK UNK STOP
START 4 STOP
START UNK STOP
START 5 STOP
START social control STOP
START 6 STOP
START UNK though undoubtedly all six processes are UNK within the whole social system and its UNK , two processes that are of crucial importance to this study will be UNK out for particular emphasis STOP
START communication STOP
START in discussing the process of communication , UNK UNK it as `` the process by which information , decisions , and UNK are UNK among UNK and the ways in which knowledge , opinions , and attitudes are formed , or modified by interaction '' STOP
START communication may be UNK by means of the high UNK within the larger community STOP
START intense interaction is easier where segregated living and occupational UNK mark off a group from the rest of the community , as in the case of this population STOP
START however , the factor of physical isolation is not a UNK situation STOP
START although the UNK population is still UNK rural , `` there are indications of a consistent and a UNK significant trend away from the older and relatively isolated rural communities STOP
START UNK appears to be an important factor in the UNK of this group STOP
START this conclusion is , however , an UNK STOP
START a more realistic analysis must take into account the fact that UNK people in the UNK area are , in general , less segregated UNK than group members in rural areas STOP
START in the urban area , in other words , they , unlike some urban UNK groups , do not UNK in UNK UNK STOP
START group pressures toward conformity are slight or UNK , and UNK behavior in mate selection UNK few if any social UNK STOP
START in such a setting social contacts and associations are likely to be UNK , resulting in a change of values and , almost necessarily , in mate selection behavior STOP
START to the extent that urban life UNK to the UNK of the group patterns of residential isolation , to that extent it UNK directly to increased UNK '' STOP
START social control STOP
START the process of social control is UNK UNK as UNK play a part in the individual's behavior , as well as the UNK behavior STOP
START by means of this social control , UNK is either eliminated or somehow made compatible with the function of the social group STOP
START examples from this population indicate that UNK seems to be UNK by UNK from the group STOP
START UNK STOP
START there is an oral tradition among the members of the population in regard to the origin and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society STOP
START confused and divided though this tradition may be , it is an important part of the social and cultural heritage of the group , and acts as a means of UNK , particularly for members of the rural community STOP
START the fact of indian UNK and `` free '' status during the days of slavery , are important distinctions made by members of the group STOP
START boundary maintenance STOP
START `` UNK induced social UNK resulting from common norms and values UNK by members of the group '' is UNK in the boundary maintenance of the group as well as in the process of UNK STOP
START the process of boundary maintenance UNK and UNK the social system or UNK , and the characteristic interaction is maintained STOP
START as the threat of UNK on the system increases , the `` probability of applied boundary maintenance mechanisms increases '' STOP
START the UNK rate pattern would seem to be a function , though a UNK one , of the process of maintaining the boundary STOP
START `` increased boundary maintenance may be achieved , for example , by UNK a higher UNK or evaluation to activities characteristic of the external pattern STOP
START '' the external pattern or external system can be considered as `` group behavior that UNK the group to survive in its environment STOP
START '' boundary maintenance for this group would seem to be primarily social , as is the UNK for UNK STOP
START it is also expressed in the UNK against UNK in the matter of UNK , particularly in rural areas STOP
START by their pattern of UNK and UNK , the core families and the marginal families show distinct limits to the UNK contact they maintain STOP
START UNK UNK STOP
START where boundary maintenance describes the UNK or limits of the group , UNK UNK is defined `` as the process whereby one or more of the elements of at least two social systems is UNK in such a manner that the two systems in some ways and on some occasions may be viewed as a single unit STOP
START a royal UNK issued in 1910 , two years after the UNK government assumed authority for the administration of the congo , prescribed the registration of all adult males by UNK STOP
START further UNK along this line were issued in UNK and UNK STOP
START in UNK a continuous registration of the whole UNK population was UNK by UNK of the UNK , and the UNK UNK of these records was ordered STOP
START but specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the UNK UNK STOP
START a UNK set of regulations , applicable to all areas , was issued in UNK , and a UNK series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was UNK at the same time STOP
START the whole system was again UNK and UNK in UNK STOP
START general responsibility for its administration UNK with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs , service UNK UNK UNK et de la UNK ( UNK , af direction , af direction UNK , UNK UNK ) STOP
START UNK authorities , the UNK and their UNK , were held responsible for maintaining the UNK of UNK persons within their UNK , under the general supervision of district officials STOP
START the district officials , along with their other duties , were obliged to UNK special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to UNK the annual UNK of demographic statistics STOP
START the regulations require the UNK of each individual ( male or female , adult or child ) on a separate card ( UNK ) STOP
START the cards , filed by UNK ( UNK , or village ) , are kept in the headquarters of each UNK ( UNK ) STOP
START each card is expected to show certain information about the individual concerned , including his or her date of birth ( or age at a specified time ) , UNK , and children STOP
START additional entries must be made from time to time STOP
START different cards are used for males and females , and a corner is UNK from the cards of adults , and of children when they reach UNK STOP
START so a quick count could be made at any time , even by an UNK UNK , of the number of registered persons in four UNK classes STOP
START personal identification cards are issued to all adult males on which tax payments , UNK , periods of employment , and changes of residence are recorded STOP
START similar identification cards were issued in 1959 to all adult females STOP
START each adult is held personally responsible for UNK his UNK and UNK an identification card which must be shown on demand STOP
START the registration card of a person leaving his home territory for a short period is put into a special file for absent persons STOP
START the cards of permanent UNK are , in theory , sent to an office in the place of new residence STOP
START finally , the registration of UNK and UNK by nearest relatives was made UNK in most regions STOP
START numbers of registered persons in four UNK classes were counted each year STOP
START in addition , demographic inquiries , UNK involving field investigations , were conducted in selected minor divisions ( UNK ) containing about 3 percent of the total population STOP
START the results of these inquiries were used to adjust UNK of data from the UNK and to provide various ratios and rates by districts , including birth and death rates , general UNK rates , UNK by UNK status , UNK of wives UNK in UNK and UNK UNK , UNK UNK , and UNK STOP
START the areas to be examined in these inquiries were selected by local officials , UNK as representative of a larger population STOP
START UNK of the ratios obtained in a few selected areas were applied to the larger population STOP
START the scheme , in theory , is an UNK UNK of european registration systems to the conditions of african life STOP
START but it places a severe strain on the administrative resources ( already UNK in other ways ) of a widely UNK , poor and largely UNK population STOP
START the sampling program was UNK before the principles of probability sampling were widely recognized in population studies STOP
START the system was not well adapted to conditions of life in urban centers STOP
START the distinction between UNK ( de UNK ) and present ( de UNK ) population was not clearly defined STOP
START so the results are subject to considerable confusion STOP
START the system tended to break down during the war , but was UNK ; ; STOP
START it had reached the UNK level of efficiency by 1951 STOP
START in spite of the defects in this system , the figures on total population during the late UNK and again in the early UNK seem to have represented actual conditions in most districts with approximate UNK STOP
START but the information on the UNK of population was often quite UNK STOP
START the same system , with minor UNK , was developed in UNK under UNK administration STOP
START here again it seems that useful UNK of the size and geographical distribution of the population were obtained in this way in the late UNK and early UNK periods STOP
START before considering more recent activities , we should note another important aspect of UNK in UNK africa STOP
START a number of strong independent agencies , established in some cases with governmental or royal support , have conducted large medical , social , educational and research operations in particular parts of the congo and UNK STOP
START the work of UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK du congo UNK ( UNK ) has special interest with respect to UNK STOP
START this agency accepted responsibility for medical services to a population ranging from UNK persons in UNK to UNK in 1956 in the UNK district and UNK areas east of UNK STOP
START each year from UNK on , its medical staff had conducted intensive field investigations to determine changes in population structure and vital rates and , as its primary objective , the UNK of major diseases STOP
START its findings are reported each year in its UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK ( UNK ) STOP
START somewhat similar investigations have been made by medical officers in other areas STOP
START other independent , or partially independent agencies , have UNK investigations on UNK directly or indirectly related to UNK STOP
START these studies vary widely in scope and precision STOP
START UNK UNK la UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK ( UNK ) has sponsored UNK field investigations and has UNK closely with the government of UNK in the development of its official statistics STOP
START a massive investigation of the characteristics of UNK and prospective UNK in UNK is being carried on by UNK , former director of the social science branch of UNK , now a professor at UNK UNK du congo UNK et du UNK STOP
START some UNK completed UNK with 20 items ( collected by UNK in UNK UNK ) have been UNK STOP
START the results are now being analyzed STOP
START statistics have been recognized as a matter of strategic importance in the congo and in UNK during the UNK years in connection with long-term economic and social programs STOP
START the UNK organizations of both countries , which maintain administrative services throughout the UNK , retained immediate responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information STOP
START however , the statistical offices of both governments were assigned responsibility for the planning and analysis of these statistics STOP
START a bureau de la UNK ( UNK , director ) was formed under UNK in the congo , to work in close UNK with the section UNK of the UNK general STOP
START eventually responsibility for demographic inquiries in the congo was transferred to the demographic division of the central statistical office STOP
START the 1952 demographic inquiry in UNK was directed by UNK , a member of the UNK staff , though the inquiry was carried out under the UNK of UNK , which has continuing responsibility for demographic statistics in this territory STOP
START a member of the UNK staff ( UNK de UNK ) was recently UNK to UNK with UNK in the development of demographic statistics in this territory STOP
START the UNK of sampling UNK in UNK ( 1952 ) and in the congo ( 1955 - UNK ) were major advances STOP
START we will deal first with the program in the congo though this was put into operation later than the other STOP
START the radical nature of the UNK in the congo was not emphasized in the official UNK STOP
START the term UNK UNK , previously used for the UNK investigations carried out in connection with the administrative UNK , was used for the new investigations STOP
START however , the differences in procedure are fundamental STOP
START these are as follows : ( 1 ) field work procedures STOP
START field operations were transferred from administrative personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to UNK trained teams of full-time african investigators ( three teams , each working in two UNK ) STOP
START these teams carried out the same operations UNK in different areas STOP
START ( 2 ) nature of the sample STOP
START sample areas in the new investigations were selected strictly by application of the principles of probability theory , so as to be representative of the total population of defined areas within UNK limits STOP
START in short , scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective sampling STOP
START the UNK of the various districts , or other major divisions , were UNK by type of community ( rural , urban , mixed ) and , where appropriate , by UNK UNK and by type of economy STOP
START sample units ( villages in rural areas , houses in cities ) were drawn UNK within these UNK STOP
START ( 3 ) size of the sample STOP
START different sampling ratios were applied under different conditions STOP
START higher proportions were UNK in urban and mixed communities than in rural areas STOP
START about 11 percent of the total population was covered in the new investigation , as compared with about 3 percent in the previous inquiries STOP
START ( 4 ) questions and UNK STOP
START uniform questions , UNK , and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country STOP
START data were obtained , UNK , on three classes of persons : ( a ) UNK , present ; ; STOP
START ( b ) UNK , absent ; ; STOP
START and ( c ) visitors STOP
START in the reports , summary results are given for both the de UNK ( a and c ) and de UNK ( a and b ) UNK ; ; STOP
START but the subsequent analysis of characteristics is reported only for the de UNK population ( or , in some districts , only the de UNK population ) STOP
START these changes represent , in effect , a shift from ( 1 ) an administrative UNK of data obtained through procedures designed primarily to serve political and economic objectives to ( 2 ) a systematic sampling UNK of the whole african population STOP
START the population registration system still has important functions STOP
START it supplies local data which are useful in administration and which can be used as a basis for intensive studies in particular situations STOP
START it provides a frame for the sampling UNK STOP
START it also provides a frame within which the registration of vital events is gradually UNK force ( though one cannot expect to obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of the congo from this source in the near future ) STOP
START it is still used in making current population estimates in UNK years , though the value of these estimates is open to question STOP
START finally , it may have certain very important , less obvious values STOP
START even though the UNK may have an incomplete record of persons present in a particular area or include persons no longer living there , they contain precise information on ages , by date of birth , for some of the persons present ( especially children in relatively stable communities ) and UNK information ( such as records of UNK status ) for many others STOP
START the quality of the UNK data can , therefore , be greatly improved by the use of the registration records in conjunction with the field inquiries STOP
START furthermore , it may be possible to estimate the error due to UNK in method ( as distinguished from sampling error ) in each of these sources , on such subjects as UNK , UNK , and UNK during a given interval by using information from two largely independent sources in conjunction STOP
START the first sampling UNK in the congo extended over a UNK period , 1955 - UNK ; ; STOP
START the results were still being processed in 1959 STOP
START it is planned to double the number of teams and to make use of improved equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960 , so that the inquiry can be carried through in one year and the results published more UNK STOP
START it is proposed that in the future complete sampling UNK be carried out at UNK intervals STOP
START reports already issued on the sampling UNK , 1955 - UNK , in various areas run as follows ( using only the french and UNK corresponding UNK UNK ) STOP
START this report contains preliminary notes and UNK tables STOP
START other reports in identical form , but with somewhat varying content , have been issued STOP
START these area reports will be followed , according to present plans , by a summary report , which will include a detailed statement on methods STOP
START with this evidence in mind , the writer began to plan how he might more effectively UNK the married students in his functional classes STOP
START toward the end of the UNK work , he UNK every married class member at great length STOP
START he found , as he had UNK , a general UNK that perhaps over half of the present UNK designed course was not really functional for these students STOP
START however , all admitted that the `` UNK '' was not altogether lost STOP
START in their own words , it had UNK them to get a UNK picture of how they had UNK into their marriages , and perhaps they had obtained some insights on why certain UNK appeared from time to time STOP
START in fact , they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design a section exclusively for married students there should be , at the beginning , some `` UNK '' study ; ; STOP
START but they all UNK to add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent STOP
START all of them felt a UNK need for more coverage on areas that could be only lightly UNK upon in a general survey functional course STOP
START a few were doubtful about the UNK of an exclusive section for married students STOP
START as one of them expressed it , `` it has done me a world of good to listen to the naive questions and comments of these UNK people STOP
START i can now better see just what processes UNK certain actions from me in the past STOP
START had i been in an UNK section i would have UNK this , and i believe that this single aspect has been of great personal value to me '' STOP
START this comment and others similar to it , would seem to indicate a possible justification for continuing the status UNK STOP
START but the weight of feeling was heavily in the opposite direction STOP
START thus , the writer decided to hold one experimental section of the functional preparation for marriage course in the spring UNK of 1960 exclusively for persons already married -- that is , UNK : `` marriage '' STOP
START this did not mean that married students could not UNK in other `` mixed '' sections , and some of them , largely because of UNK difficulties , did STOP
START but only those already married could UNK in this one section STOP
START in addition , two other differences in the two types of sections must be noted STOP
START ( 1 ) the regular sections do not allow UNK ; ; STOP
START this one did STOP
START this action was UNK on the basis of a small survey which indicated that a high percentage of married UNK women on our campus never become UNK STOP
START many of them appear to drop out , for one reason or another STOP
START by UNK UNK students we might extend the opportunity for such a course to some individuals who otherwise might never get to take it STOP
START this has UNK been UNK by the experience STOP
START ( 2 ) UNK were encouraged STOP
START in the regular sections they have always been more or less discouraged STOP
START the philosophy has been that if they could find the time to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit and perhaps provide an UNK to do the work more effectively STOP
START besides , UNK do not count on faculty load with the same weight as regularly UNK students STOP
START but in this one section we UNK UNK STOP
START why ? ? STOP
START for no particular reason , other than that the writer felt it might -- just might -- encourage both UNK to be in UNK STOP
START many of the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum , especially in the various engineering fields , with few UNK till the senior year STOP
START UNK , it needs to be noted that because UNK were permitted the section began increasing in numbers each week , until at last it UNK to such proportions that this `` free '' UNK policy had to be UNK STOP
START after that , we began to get `` visitors '' to class STOP
START this experimental class represented quite a variety of students STOP
START it ranged from a UNK woman , just married , through the various academic growth stages , including one UNK student , to a young faculty member recently married to a senior man who also attended STOP
START it ranged from those with no children , through students in various stages of UNK , to one UNK male with four children , three of whom were UNK STOP
START it ranged from two women members who had experienced UNK UNK to one couple twelve years married and seemingly unable to conceive STOP
START one might UNK at this point and UNK that if it is `` wise '' to create special sections for special status , then why not a special section for women UNK before marriage , and one for UNK men with UNK children , and so on STOP
START some of these UNK may have some merit , others are somewhat ambiguous STOP
START but few who have experienced marriage can dispute the fact that the focus of UNK relationships is different in marriage than in a UNK situation STOP
START the writer began this special class by UNK his background thinking for creating such a section in the first place STOP
START he made it clear from the beginning that this was the UNK opportunity , and that the future destiny of such groups UNK on favorable results from this one STOP
START he did build a UNK of academic `` UNK '' , and one which did not UNK upon the `` sacred sovereignty '' of any other existing campus course STOP
START this is to say that this was not a course in wise buying or money spending methods , nor a course in how to raise children STOP
START we already have courses covering those problems , and so on STOP
START but within that UNK he allowed for as much flexibility as possible STOP
START a UNK committee of students was organized on the first day whose duty it was to be alert and constantly evaluate and UNK the direction and pace the class was taking STOP
START the writer , being UNK through his interviews of the reactions of previous married students , did insist on there being included some `` UNK '' material STOP
START but the greater part of UNK time was actually centered around the attitudes : `` so we are married -- now how do we make the best of it '' ? ? STOP
START or `` how do we UNK our already fine marriage '' ? ? STOP
START films were used , as with all sections , but with one big difference STOP
START our campus , unfortunately , UNK no films STOP
START since they are all either UNK or UNK , the UNK dates for their use have to be far in advance STOP
START the writer never knew from week to week just where the section might be STOP
START for example , the UNK committee might UNK that the group felt a UNK under study should not be dropped for an additional week as there was still too much of it UNK STOP
START since the writer had established this democratic procedure in the beginning he had to go along with their decision -- after , of course , pointing out whether he thought their decision was a wise or an UNK one STOP
START thus the films seen as they came in ( coordinated for the regular sections ) , were often out of context STOP
START nevertheless , the writer has never experienced such UNK of discussion after film UNK STOP
START though it did not become known to the writer for some time , a UNK group had UNK up within the class STOP
START they began to meet in the UNK and carry forward various discussions they felt not fully enough covered in class STOP
START from a few students this group gradually increased to include over UNK of those UNK UNK in the class , and many UNK as well STOP
START also , although only a few of the students were UNK UNK with each other in the beginning , most reported that when the UNK ended their UNK and UNK campus UNK were with members of that class STOP
START in fact , they often UNK their social activities to include class members previously unknown STOP
START UNK outside reading reports were handled just as in the other sections , the major difference being that there was a UNK deeper level in the reported outside reading by the married group STOP
START these students , although they might read various articles in popular magazines , more often chose to report on articles found in the UNK STOP
START in addition to the UNK difference in outside articles , there was a considerable difference in the outside books they read STOP
START whereas a high percentage of the regular students can be expected to read other UNK which more or less UNK the same ground in a little different direction , the married students chose whole books on specific areas and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest STOP
START since the writer had not noticed this characteristic in married students scattered throughout the various sections previous to this experiment , nor , as a matter of fact , in those who were continuing in `` single sections '' , he can only conclude that there must have been something `` UNK '' within the specific group which caused this to occur STOP
START in the main , this course took the following UNK high roads STOP
START ( 1 ) a great deal of time was spent on processes for UNK UNK differences STOP
START this was not a search for a `` magic formula '' , but rather an examination of basic principles UNK especially to all types of communication in marriage STOP
START in short , it was centered around learning how to develop a more sensitive UNK STOP
START not until the group was satisfied in this area were they willing to venture further to ( 2 ) , specific adjustment areas , such as sex , UNK , religion , finance , and so on STOP
START from here they proceeded to ( 3 ) these same areas in relation to their own future family life stages , developing these to the extent of UNK various crises which could be expected to UNK them at some time or other STOP
START as an example of this last UNK , there were some UNK discussions centered around UNK STOP
START mainly these were concerned with the possibility of the death of one parent and the UNK of living with the UNK UNK , but the possible death of one's own UNK was not UNK STOP
START since the course , one member has lost her husband STOP
START this was not a particularly UNK or unexpected thing -- it was previously known to her that it might happen STOP
START but just when was an unknown , and of course the longer it did not happen , the stronger her wish and belief that it might not STOP
START since her UNK this individual has reported to the writer on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions were to her in this adjustment crisis STOP
START quite frequently class members brought questions from their UNK at home STOP
START these were often carefully written out with a great deal of thought behind them STOP
START this added a personal UNK to class discussions and participation STOP
START both UNK reported that the discussions on sex adjustment within marriage were extremely UNK STOP
START the writer UNK a much UNK and more frank discussion , especially of this one area , than ever before STOP
START he felt certain for the first time in his teaching experience that the men in the class understood that UNK , as a UNK , is not nearly so essential for a UNK female sexual experience as most males might think STOP
START this was probably much more meaningful because all the women in the class emphasized it time and again STOP
START on the other hand , the women class members appeared to reach a far greater understanding than have women members in other sections that it is more natural for males as a group to view sex as sex rather than always UNK it with love as most women seem to do STOP
START in the UNK area it could be readily observed that all felt UNK to discuss things than students had previously in `` mixed '' UNK status sections STOP
START perhaps this was related to the fact that all were in on it to some extent STOP
START never in other sections has there been the opportunity for the genuine UNK discussions about the feelings of both UNK during various stages of UNK STOP
START there was a particularly UNK opportunity for study in this area since almost every stage of UNK was represented , from a UNK couple to and including every UNK STOP
START in fact , we had one birth before the end of the course , and another student had to take the final UNK a week early , just to be on the safe side STOP
START there was also one spontaneous UNK during the UNK STOP
START thus it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief `` UNK '' experience STOP
START it was UNK that UNK subjects would UNK to more liberal , UNK reports of what the ambiguous figure `` looked like '' as UNK their UNK about taking UNK STOP
START this was true mostly of those UNK subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action STOP
START responses such as `` UNK with a loop in it '' , and `` two pieces of UNK '' , were quite characteristic STOP
START UNK personality inventories STOP
START the three personality inventories ( UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK ) were filled out by 12 of the kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the UNK subjects STOP
START these were the same subjects who were given the UNK test STOP
START some UNK had been made concerning factors r , n , i and UNK on these inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security aspects of personality UNK which were UNK as being of importance in differential kohnstamm reactivity STOP
START only UNK UNK between the two groups at less than the UNK level ( af ) STOP
START one UNK had been made about the difference in security or UNK between those subjects who UNK their kohnstamm reactivity when informed and those who did not STOP
START the UNK had been separated into two groups on this assumption with the presumably `` secure '' UNK and `` secure '' UNK being used as the groups for comparative personality studies STOP
START it was UNK that those who UNK in their kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly from those who did not on the factor i which the investigators refer to as the `` UNK '' factor STOP
START all of the subjects in the UNK and kohnstamm-positive groups ( as defined for purposes of the personality studies ) were compared with those subjects who UNK in conditions 3 , or 4 STOP
START a t test on these two groups , UNK UNK , gave a `` t '' value of UNK which is significant on the UNK test at the STOP
START level STOP
START discussion STOP
START individual differences STOP
START individual differences in kohnstamm reactivity to controlled kohnstamm situations were found among the subjects used in the study STOP
START only UNK ( 11 subjects ) gave a positive kohnstamm reaction when completely naive concerning the phenomenon STOP
START there were UNK ( 20 subjects ) who did not give a positive reaction even after they were informed of the UNK of such a reaction and had been given a demonstration STOP
START there were UNK ( 10 subjects ) who UNK from a negative to a positive reaction after they were UNK as to the UNK of the kohnstamm-positive reaction STOP
START among this latter group there were also differences in the amount and kind of information necessary before a shift in reaction occurred STOP
START one subject changed when given only the information that some people have something happen to their arm when they relax STOP
START five subjects ( UNK ) did not change until they had been told that some people have something happen to their arm , what that something was , and also were given a demonstration STOP
START four subjects ( UNK ) did not change even then but needed the additional information that an UNK under these circumstances was a perfectly normal UNK reaction which some people showed while others did not STOP
START at no time was it implied by the UNK that the UNK initial reaction was UNK STOP
START the subjects were only given information about other possibilities of `` normal '' reaction STOP
START those who responded with an UNK in the naive state did not change their reaction when told that there were some normal people who did not react in this fashion STOP
START this information was accepted with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not show UNK must be UNK it STOP
START these subjects implied that they too could prevent their arms from rising if they tried STOP
START the positive kohnstamm reactivity in condition 1 ( ( the naive state ) is not adequately explained by such a concept as UNK ( if UNK is defined as the influence on behavior by verbal UNK ) STOP
START in no way , either UNK or UNK , did the UNK indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of UNK to the voluntary contraction STOP
START moreover , when the UNK did UNK those subjects that there were some normal people who did not have their arm rise once they UNK , the kohnstamm-positive subjects were UNK in their subsequent reactions to the kohnstamm situation STOP
START they continued to give an UNK STOP
START a differential UNK would have to be UNK to explain the failure of this additional information to influence the kohnstamm-positive UNK and yet UNK their naive kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion STOP
START UNK , the reaction of the subject in such a way as to UNK to his own expectations of the outcome ( i.e, that the UNK is a reaction to the pressure exerted in the voluntary contraction , because of his knowledge that `` to every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction '' ) also seems inadequate as an explanation for the following reasons : ( 1 ) the UNK apparently genuine experience of surprise when their arms rose , and ( 2 ) UNK of the phenomenon despite UNK of something else happening ( e.g, of becoming UNK and maybe falling , an UNK UNK UNK by one of the subjects ) STOP
START a suggestion hypothesis also seems inadequate as an explanation for those who UNK their reactions after they were informed of the possibilities of `` normal '' reactions different from those which they gave STOP
START while they were told that there were some normal people who UNK UNK than they had , they were also informed that there were other UNK who UNK as they had STOP
START there was no UNK made that their initial reaction ( absence of an UNK ) was less preferred than the presence of UNK STOP
START a more UNK explanation for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge and increased UNK with the total situation made it possible for these subjects to be less UNK and to relax , since any reaction seemed acceptable to the UNK as `` normal '' STOP
START the naive state , condition 1 , , could therefore be viewed as an UNK one for UNK of the subjects in this study STOP
START they were not free to be themselves in this situation , an UNK one , where there was an observer of their reactions and they had no guide for acceptable behavior STOP
START instructions to relax , i.e, to be `` spontaneous '' , and react immediately to whatever UNK they might have , was not sufficiently UNK until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions had been given STOP
START while other conditions might be even more effective in bringing about a change from UNK to UNK in kohnstamm reactivity , it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would have as a common factor the capacity to UNK an attitude in the subject which UNK him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of responsibility for his behavior STOP
START UNK UNK succeeded in changing UNK to UNK quite UNK in one pilot subject ( the only one with whom this technique was tried ) STOP
START this subject , who has been UNK UNK UNK for five years , did not give a positive kohnstamm reaction under any of the four UNK conditions used in this experiment while UNK STOP
START after two UNK containing UNK , her arm UNK upward very freely STOP
START there was evident delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of the freedom of movement STOP
START she described herself as having the same kind of `` UNK '' feeling as she had once experienced under UNK STOP
START she UNK her delight with both experiences to the effect they seemed to have of temporarily UNK from her the controls which she felt so UNK necessary to maintain even when it might seem appropriate to relax these controls STOP
START many subjects attributed differences in kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective control -- voluntary as the kohnstamm-positive subjects UNK it and UNK as the UNK subjects UNK it STOP
START these suggested UNK were given by the subjects UNK when they were told that there were people who UNK UNK than they had STOP
START the kohnstamm-positive subjects described the vivid experience of having their arms rise as one in which they exercised no control STOP
START they explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention of control factors STOP
START they felt that they too could UNK the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced the reaction STOP
START some of those who did not initially react with an UNK also associated their behavior in the situation with control factors -- an inability to UNK control UNK STOP
START one subject UNK asked ( after her arm had finally UNK ) , `` do you suppose i was UNK keeping it down before '' ? ? STOP
START another said that her arm did not go up at first `` because i wouldn't let it ; ; STOP
START i thought it wasn't supposed to '' STOP
START this subject was one who gave an UNK on the second trial in the naive state but not in the first STOP
START she had felt that her arm wanted to go up in the first trial , but had UNK prevented it from so doing STOP
START she explained UNK of others by saying that they were `` not letting themselves relax '' STOP
START when informed that there were some persons who did not have their arm go up , she UNK , `` i don't see how they can prevent it '' STOP
START in contrast to this UNK explanation for UNK given by the kohnstamm-positive subjects , the UNK subjects offered an UNK hypothesis to explain UNK STOP
START they felt that they were UNK as much as they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent response must be on an unconscious level STOP
START the above discussion does not mean to UNK that control factors were completely in UNK in the kohnstamm-positive subjects ; ; STOP
START but rather that they could be UNK sufficiently not to UNK with UNK STOP
START one kohnstamm-positive subject who had both arms rise while being tested in the naive condition described her subjective experience as follows : `` you feel they're going up and you're on a stage and it's not right for them to do so and then you think maybe that's UNK supposed to happen '' STOP
START she then described her experience as one in which she first had difficulty accepting for herself a state of being in which she UNK control STOP
START however , she was able to relax and yield to the moment STOP
START it is our hypothesis that kohnstamm-positive subjects are less UNK about UNK control than are UNK subjects ; ; STOP
START that they can give up their control and allow themselves to be UNK rather than UNK STOP
START it is our belief that this readiness to UNK some control was evidenced by the kohnstamm-positive subjects in some of the other experimental situations to be discussed below STOP
START thus , this readiness to relax controls , evidenced in the kohnstamm situation , appears to be a more general personality factor STOP
START UNK illusion STOP
START the kohnstamm-positive subjects seemed to be UNK to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible in the external world STOP
START there was a significantly greater number in this group who reported a desk as being in a UNK position while a UNK ball UNK on it remained UNK on the UNK STOP
START this occurred in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be going UNK STOP
START they knew that their UNK experience UNK from objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting on the UNK UNK STOP
START yet they were not so bound by past experience and UNK as to deny their immediate UNK and to be dominated by their knowledge of what the experience should be STOP
START the change in UNK by some of the UNK subjects , after they had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions , suggests that their UNK and UNK is associated with their general mode of UNK to strange or unknown situations STOP
START they were able to experience at first , in terms of past UNK STOP
START when informed as to the various possibilities of normal reactions , they were then able to experience the UNK of the present STOP
START it might be UNK that these subjects are UNK afraid of being wrong ; ; STOP
START that they perceive new internal and UNK situations as `` threatening '' until they are tested and proved otherwise STOP
START while the UNK that have been given are UNK only , they gain support from such comments as the following , which was made by one of the UNK subjects who did not , on the first trial , perceive the UNK illusion STOP
START control of UNK status STOP
START it would have been desirable for the two communities to have UNK only in respect to the variable being investigated : the degree of structure in teaching method STOP
START the structured schools were in an industrial city , with UNK UNK houses typical of the residential areas , but with one rather UNK section of middle-class homes STOP
START the unstructured schools were in a large suburban community , UNK UNK to UNK class , but UNK by an industrial area STOP
START in order to UNK the samples on UNK status , we chose schools in both cities on the basis of UNK status of the neighborhoods STOP
START school UNK and guidance workers made UNK of the various neighborhoods and the research team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas STOP
START an objective scale was developed for UNK school neighborhoods from these data STOP
START equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from UNK and UNK class neighborhoods STOP
START subjects STOP
START individual differences in UNK and the development of readiness for learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement STOP
START therefore , UNK children were chosen as subjects for this study STOP
START for purposes of sample selection only ( individual tests were given later ) we obtained group test scores of reading achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire UNK population in each school system STOP
START the subjects for this study were UNK selected from UNK areas of the distribution , one-third as UNK , one-third medium , and one-third UNK STOP
START children whose reading scores were at least one standard deviation below the UNK line of each total UNK school population were considered UNK for the purposes of sample selection STOP
START UNK were at least one standard deviation above the UNK line in their school system STOP
START the final sample was not significantly different from a normal distribution in regard to reading achievement or intelligence test scores STOP
START UNK UNK in twelve unstructured schools furnished UNK cases , UNK boys and UNK girls STOP
START eight UNK in three structured schools furnished UNK cases , UNK boys and UNK girls STOP
START administrative restrictions UNK the smaller sample size in the structured schools STOP
START it was assumed that the sampling procedure was purely random with respect to the personality variables under investigation STOP
START UNK scale of compulsivity STOP
START an interview schedule of UNK questions and a UNK questionnaire were prepared , and one parent of each of the sample children was seen in the home STOP
START the parent was asked to describe the child's typical behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity to observe UNK toward UNK in demands upon self and others , UNK conformity to rules , UNK , UNK , and need for certainty STOP
START the UNK were UNK not to suggest answers and , as much as possible , to record the UNK actual words as they described the child's behavior in home situations STOP
START the UNK scale of compulsivity was constructed by first UNK the interview records , UNK all evidence related to compulsivity , then UNK a distribution of such information apart from the case records STOP
START final UNK were made on the basis of a point system which was developed after studying the UNK of actual UNK recorded and UNK weight values to each type of behavior that was UNK from the discovered norms STOP
START children UNK high in compulsivity were those who gave evidence of tension or UNK in situations where there was lack of organization or conformity to standards and expectations , or who made UNK efforts to achieve these goals STOP
START the low UNK child was one who appeared relatively UNK about such matters STOP
START for instance , the following statement was UNK low in compulsivity , `` UNK naturally quite UNK about things , but it doesn't UNK her at all if her room gets UNK STOP
START but she UNK it up very well when i UNK her '' STOP
START measurement of anxiety STOP
START UNK , et UNK revised the UNK anxiety scale for use with children STOP
START the UNK scale was adapted from the UNK UNK personality inventory , with item selection based upon clinical UNK of anxiety STOP
START there is much research evidence to UNK the use of the instrument in UNK individuals who are likely to UNK anxiety in varying degrees STOP
START UNK and UNK work with the children's anxiety scale by UNK , et UNK demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with the adult scale STOP
START although the UNK scale was designed as a group testing device , in this study it was individually UNK by UNK trained workers who established UNK and UNK the children in reading the items STOP
START relationship of anxiety to compulsivity STOP
START the question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity STOP
START the two UNK yield a correlation of , which is not significantly different from zero ; ; STOP
START therefore , we have measured two different characteristics STOP
START in theory , UNK behavior is a way of UNK anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the UNK UNK are not sufficient to UNK the amount of anxiety they suffer STOP
START the issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later STOP
START UNK measurement STOP
START in the primary grades , reading UNK almost every aspect of school progress , and the children's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively UNK throughout the following years STOP
START in establishing UNK measurements , it was therefore thought best to UNK the scope beyond the reading act itself STOP
START the UNK interaction effect should , if UNK , extend its influence over all academic achievement STOP
START the UNK achievement test , form UNK , was UNK by classroom teachers , consisting of a battery of six UNK : UNK meaning , word meaning , UNK , language , UNK UNK , and UNK UNK STOP
START all of these UNK involve reading except UNK UNK STOP
START scores are stated in UNK on a national UNK STOP
START the battery UNK UNK was used in data analysis in this study STOP
START the UNK intelligence scale for children was UNK to each sample UNK child by a clinical worker STOP
START the relationship of intelligence test scores to school achievement is a UNK fact ( in this case , af ) ; ; STOP
START therefore , in the investigation of the present hypothesis , it was necessary to control this factor STOP
START the UNK score used in the statistical analysis is an index of UNK or UNK STOP
START it is the UNK between the actual UNK achievement test score and the score that would be UNK by the UNK STOP
START for example , on the basis of the UNK equation , a child with an UNK UNK in this sample would be expected to earn an achievement test score of UNK ( grade equivalent ) STOP
START if a child with an UNK UNK UNK UNK in achievement , his UNK score would be , representing of one year of UNK STOP
START a child with an UNK UNK would be expected to earn an achievement test score of UNK STOP
START if such a child UNK UNK , his UNK score would be UNK , representing of one year of UNK STOP
START in this manner , the factors measured by the intelligence test were controlled , allowing discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting from other variables STOP
START results STOP
START test of interaction of compulsivity and teaching methods STOP
START tables 1 and 2 present the results of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the UNK variable STOP
START figure 1 UNK the mean achievement scores of each UNK UNK STOP
START first of all , as we had UNK , the highly UNK children in the structured setting score significantly better ( af ) on achievement than do similar children in the unstructured schools STOP
START it can be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity within the structured schools , the high UNK children do better ( af ) STOP
START no significant difference was found in achievement between high and low UNK children within the unstructured school STOP
START the hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching method was supported , in this case , at the level STOP
START while we had expected that UNK children in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured , we were UNK to find that the achievement of the high UNK within the schools where the UNK method is used in beginning reading UNK favorably with that of the low UNK STOP
START indeed their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference was not significant STOP
START we UNK that UNK in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of the lack of UNK in their school setting , but that their need to UNK ( for comfort ) is so intense that they struggle to UNK the UNK rules and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the environment STOP
START it is interesting to note that medium UNK in the unstructured schools made the UNK achievement scores ( although not significantly lower ) STOP
START possibly their compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure STOP
START our UNK is , then , that regardless of the manner in which school UNK are taught , the UNK child UNK those elements of each lesson that aid him in UNK his work STOP
START when helped by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation , then , and only then , does such a child attain unusual success STOP
START test of interaction of anxiety and teaching methods STOP
START the statistical analyses of achievement in relation to anxiety and teaching methods and the UNK of the two are presented in tables 3 and 4 STOP
START figure 2 is a graph of the mean achievement scores of each group STOP
START as UNK , the highly anxious children in the unstructured schools score more UNK ( af ) than those in the structured schools STOP
START the interaction effect , which is significant at the level , can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores STOP
START while high anxiety children achieve significantly less well ( af ) in the unstructured school than do low anxiety children , they appear to do at least as well as the average in the structured classroom STOP
START the most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked UNK in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools STOP
START according to the theory proposed , this is a consequence of the severe condition of UNK threat that UNK UNK for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment STOP
START the fact that such threat is UNK in the beginning reading UNK is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or UNK these children exhibit STOP
START the child with high anxiety may first direct his UNK energy toward achievement , but because his distress severely UNK the abilities of discrimination and UNK of complex symbols , the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem STOP
START failure UNK the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult , so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the UNK in performance is UNK STOP
START the individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and UNK powers of discrimination STOP
START but the symbols he is asked to learn are simple STOP
START as shown earlier , the highly anxious individual may be superior in his UNK of simple elements STOP
START success UNK the prospect of threat and his powers of discrimination are improved STOP
START by the time the child first UNK the actual problem of reading , he is completely familiar and at ease with all of the elements of words STOP
START apparently academic challenge in the structured setting UNK an optimum of stress so that the child with high anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an UNK state without becoming confused or UNK STOP
START UNK et UNK present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the UNK situation , and that his performance will be UNK unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher STOP
START although the present study was not a direct UNK of their investigations , the results do not confirm their conclusion STOP
START observers , in the two school systems studied here , judged the teachers in the structured schools to be more UNK and demanding , while the atmosphere in the unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting STOP
START yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous UNK only in the unstructured school , and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting STOP
START analysis STOP
START analysis means the evaluation of UNK , the comparative UNK of parts , the UNK of the meaning of isolated elements STOP
START analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and UNK good parts STOP
START UNK purposes STOP
START up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals STOP
START roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals STOP
START for example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying STOP
START examples STOP
START let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis STOP
START one should keep in mind that many of the exciting UNK of roleplaying are largely UNK and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas STOP
START evaluation STOP
START the president of a small firm selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business STOP
START UNK , UNK references , training the salesmen , having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive -- and the rate of UNK due to UNK or UNK performance was too high STOP
START it was his experience that only one good UNK was found out of every seven hired -- and only one was hired out of every seven UNK STOP
START roleplaying was offered as a solution -- and the procedure worked as follows : all candidates were invited to a hotel conference room , where the president explained the difficulty he had , and how UNK it seemed to him to UNK people who just did not work out STOP
START in place of asking salesmen to fill UNK , UNK their references , UNK them , asking them to be tried out , he told them he would prefer to test them STOP
START each person was to enter the testing room , carrying a UNK of samples STOP
START each UNK was to read a sheet containing a description of the product STOP
START in the testing room he was to make , UNK , three UNK to three different people STOP
START in the testing room , three of the veteran salesmen served as UNK STOP
START one handled the UNK in a friendly manner , another in a rough manner , and the third in a UNK manner STOP
START each was told to purchase material if he felt like it STOP
START the UNK came in , one at a time , and did not see or hear the other UNK STOP
START after each presentation , the UNK wrote his judgment of the salesmen ; ; STOP
START and so did the observers consisting of the president , three of his salesmen and a UNK STOP
START ten salesmen were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon STOP
START this procedure was repeated one day a month for four months STOP
START the UNK average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three STOP
START the president of the firm , UNK expenses alone , felt his costs had dropped UNK while success in selection had improved over one hundred per cent STOP
START the reason for the value of this procedure was simply that the UNK were tested `` at work '' in different situations by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen conducted themselves with different , but typical restaurant owners and managers STOP
START they were , in a sense , `` tried out '' in realistic situations STOP
START from the point of view of the UNK , less time was UNK in being evaluated -- and they got a meal out of it as well as some insights into their performances STOP
START another use of roleplaying for evaluation UNK how this procedure can be used in real life situations without special equipment or special UNK during the daily course of work STOP
START the position of UNK was opened in a large office and an UNK was made to the other girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher prestige and slightly higher salary than UNK and UNK positions STOP
START all UNK were generally familiar with the work of the UNK STOP
START at the end of work one day , the personnel man took the UNK one at a time , asked them to sit behind the UNK desk and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to the UNK with a number of UNK and for a number of purposes STOP
START each girl was independently `` tested '' by the personnel man , and he served not only as the director , but as the UNK and the observer STOP
START somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl , whom he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat UNK and also had been in the office a relatively short time , did the most outstanding job of playing the role of UNK , showing UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START she was hired and was found to be entirely satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day STOP
START analysis STOP
START in considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area , since we are now no longer dealing with a simple over-all decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen in dynamic UNK STOP
START some cases in evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure STOP
START an engineer had been made the works manager of a firm , UNK a retired employee who had been considered UNK successful STOP
START the engineer had more than seven years of experience in the firm , was well trained , was considered a hard worker , was UNK by his fellow engineers for his technical competence and was regarded as a `` UNK '' STOP
START however , he turned out to be a complete failure in his new position STOP
START he seemed to UNK everyone STOP
START UNK rates of personnel went up , production dropped , and UNK was UNK reduced STOP
START despite the fact that he was regarded as an outstanding engineer , he seemed to be a very poor UNK , although no one quite knew what was wrong with him STOP
START at the UNK of his own UNK -- the president of the firm -- he UNK in a course designed to develop leaders STOP
START he played a number of typical situations before observers , other UNK who kept notes and then explained to him in detail what he did they thought was wrong STOP
START entirely concerned with efficiency , he was UNK in UNK people who made UNK , UNK them to too great an extent STOP
START he did not really listen to others , had little interest in their ideas , and wanted to have his own way -- which was the only right way STOP
START the entire group of managers explained , in great detail , a number of human relations errors that he made STOP
START one by one , these errors were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors STOP
START he admitted his behavior , and defended it STOP
START he refused to change his approach , and instead he attacked high and low -- the officials for their not UNK him , and UNK for their UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START after the UNK , he left the course , convinced that it could do him no good STOP
START we may say that his problem was UNK but that he refused treatment STOP
START the engineer turned works manager had a particular view of life -- and refused to change it STOP
START we may say that his attitude was UNK , since he may have been a success had he learned some human relations skills ; ; STOP
START or we may say that his attitude was UNK , showing his independence of mind , in his refusal to adjust to the opinions of others STOP
START in any case , he refused to accept the implications of the analysis , that he needed to be made over STOP
START another case may be given in illustration of a successful use of analysis , and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis STOP
START in a course for UNK operators , a district manager who had been recently appointed to his position after being UNK successful as a store manager , found that in UNK other managers he was having a difficult time STOP
START on playing some typical situations before a jury of his UNK he showed some characteristics UNK as UNK STOP
START he was told he displayed , for example , a sense of UNK -- and he answered : `` well , i am supposed to know all the answers , aren't i '' ? ? STOP
START he was UNK for his UNK and UNK -- and he answered : `` i am not working to become popular '' STOP
START on being UNK for his arbitrary behavior -- he answered : `` i have to make decisions STOP
START that's my job '' STOP
START in short , as frequently happens in analyses , the individual feels threatened and UNK himself STOP
START however , in this case the district manager was led to see the errors of his ways STOP
START the necessary step between UNK and training is acceptance of the validity of the UNK STOP
START how this was accomplished may be described , since this sometimes is a crucial problem STOP
START the director helped UNK a check list of the district UNK errors by asking various observers to write out UNK UNK on the UNK they felt he made STOP
START these errors were then collected and written on a UNK , UNK similar ideas STOP
START UNK errors were located , and then the director asked each individual to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the particular errors STOP
START they were asked to vote `` true '' if they thought they had seen him make the error , `` false '' if they thought he had not ; ; STOP
START and `` cannot say '' if they were not certain STOP
START the manager sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went up , and the director wrote the numbers on the UNK STOP
START no comments were made during the voting STOP
START the results looked as follows : af STOP
START the first eight of these UNK statements , which received at least UNK of the UNK , were UNK to form an analysis UNK for the particular manager , and when this particular manager UNK in other situations , the members checked any items that appeared STOP
START to prevent the manager from deliberately controlling himself only during the sessions , they were rather UNK ( about twenty minutes ) , the situations were UNK described to the manager so that he would not know what to expect , new UNK were brought on the scene UNK , and the UNK were UNK to deliberately UNK in such ways as to UNK the manager and get him to operate in a manner for which he had been previously UNK STOP
START after every session , the check marks were UNK up and UNK , and in this way the UNK progress was UNK STOP
START summary STOP
START in life we learn to play our roles and we `` UNK '' into patterns which become so UNK that we are not really aware of what we do STOP
START we can see others more clearly than we can see ourselves , and others can see us better than we see ourselves STOP
START to learn what we do is the first step for improvement STOP
START to accept the validity of the judgments of others is the second step STOP
START to want to change is the third step STOP
START to practice new procedures under guided supervision and with constant UNK is the fourth step STOP
START to use these new ways in daily life is the last step STOP
START roleplaying used for analysis follows these general steps leading to training STOP
START when an UNK situation is set up , and no concern is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate , we say that roleplaying is used for evaluation STOP
START observers can see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior , and watch him operating in a UNK fashion STOP
START this behavior is more `` UNK '' -- or true -- than other testing behavior for some types of evaluation , and so can give quick and accurate estimates of complex UNK STOP
START while roleplaying for testing is not too well understood at the present time , it represents one of the major uses of this procedure STOP
START chapter 10 , UNK training STOP
START the objective of this chapter is to clarify the distinctions between UNK theory and other training concepts STOP
START in addition , the basic approach UNK in applying roleplaying will be UNK STOP
START the goal will be to provide the reader with an UNK UNK to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training area STOP
START the reasons for UNK this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training are UNK STOP
START 1 STOP
START UNK training theory is unique and relatively new STOP
START it is not easy for the therapist to UNK when , in the patient's UNK , an UNK has appeared and is holding UNK STOP
START one UNK to become alert to changes in his UNK tone -- to his UNK suddenly UNK to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , UNK STOP
START the content of his words may UNK back into UNK UNK , as if a UNK UNK were UNK in one UNK ; ; STOP
START only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously UNK some UNK UNK , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over and over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him STOP
START one UNK woman often became UNK in what felt to me like a somehow UNK experience of UNK , during which , despite her UNK UNK and UNK UNK , i felt only a cold UNK with her STOP
START eventually such UNK became more UNK , and more sharply UNK from her UNK behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior -- which , as usual , went on without any accompanying words from her -- she asked , UNK , `` did you see UNK '' ? ? STOP
START at first i did not know what she meant ; ; STOP
START i thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her UNK , in their distant UNK STOP
START then i realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what UNK was like ; ; STOP
START and when i replied in this spirit , she UNK my UNK STOP
START at another phase in the therapy , when a UNK UNK began to emerge more and more upon the UNK scene , she UNK in a low but intense voice , to herself , `` i hate that woman inside me '' ! ! STOP
START i could UNK no further UNK from her about this ; ; STOP
START but a few UNK later she was standing directly across the room from me , looking me in the eyes and saying in a UNK UNK tone , `` your father UNK you '' ! ! STOP
START again , i at first UNK this UNK intense communication , and i quickly cast through my mind to account for her being able to speak , with such UNK conviction , of an opinion held by my father , now several years UNK STOP
START then i replied , UNK , `` if you UNK me , why don't you say so , directly '' ? ? STOP
START she looked confused at this , and i felt sure it had been a wrong response for me to make STOP
START it then occurred to me to ask , `` is that what that woman told you '' ? ? STOP
START she clearly agreed that this had been the case STOP
START i realized , now , that she had been showing me , in what impressed me as being a very accurate way , something her mother had once said to her ; ; STOP
START it was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why she UNK that woman inside her STOP
START what had been an UNK powerful UNK was now , despite its continuing charge of energy UNK to me , sufficiently within control of her UNK that she could use it to show me what this UNK mother was like STOP
START earlier , this woman had been so filled with a UNK variety of UNK that at times , when she was in her room alone , it would sound to a UNK as though there were several different persons in the room , as she would UNK in various kinds of voice STOP
START a somewhat less UNK UNK patient of mine , who used to often UNK herself in her room , often UNK through the closed door -- as i would find on passing by , between our sessions -- for all the world like two persons , a UNK mother and a UNK child STOP
START particularly hard for the therapist to UNK are those instances in which the patient is UNK an UNK UNK to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only UNK aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds UNK UNK STOP
START i have found , time and again , that some bit of particularly UNK and UNK behavior on the part of a patient rests , in the final analysis , on this basis ; ; STOP
START and only when i can UNK this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a UNK UNK aspect of the patient's behavior STOP
START for example , one UNK man used to UNK me , month after month , by saying , whenever i got up to leave and made my fairly UNK comment that i would be seeing him on the following day , or whenever , `` you're welcome '' , in a notably UNK fashion -- as though it were his due for me to UNK him for the privilege of spending the hour with him , and he were thus pointing up my failure to UNK a UNK UNK , `` UNK you '' to him at the end of each session STOP
START eventually it became clear to me , partly with the aid of another UNK patient who could point out my UNK to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his UNK , `` you're welcome '' , was very accurately UNK an element of UNK UNK which had been present in my own UNK , over these months , on each of these occasions when i had bid him UNK with the UNK note , each time , that the UNK christ would be UNK to UNK this UNK to the poor UNK again on the UNK STOP
START another patient , a UNK woman , for many months UNK not only me but the UNK and her fellow patients by UNK UNK as though she owned the whole building , as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met STOP
START this behavior on her part UNK only after i had come to see the UNK close UNK between , on the one hand , her UNK the UNK of the common living room to her own UNK , or turning the television off or on without regard to the wishes of the others , and on the other hand , my own coming UNK into her room despite her persistent and UNK UNK , bringing my big easy chair with me , usually UNK the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state , and UNK myself down in my chair -- in short , UNK as if i owned her room STOP
START 4 STOP
START UNK STOP
START here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated , or reduced , in their UNK expression , to some comparatively UNK verbal or UNK statement STOP
START one finds , for example , that a UNK and UNK verbal expression , UNK at first to be a mere UNK convention , reveals itself over the months of therapy as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings , and the most UNK of meanings STOP
START more than anything , it is the UNK UNK UNK of these UNK meanings in the UNK which helps these meanings to become revealed , something like a UNK UNK of cards , on UNK occasions over the passage of the patient's and his months of work together STOP
START one cannot assume , of course , that all these UNK meanings were inherent in the UNK at the beginning of the therapy , or at any one time later on when the UNK was UNK ; ; STOP
START probably it is correct to think of it as a matter of a UNK , UNK mode of expression -- and no , or but a few , other UNK UNK , as yet -- being there , available for the patient's use , as UNK emotions and ideas well up in him over the course of months STOP
START but it is true that the therapist can sense , when he UNK this UNK , that there are at this moment many emotional UNK at work in it , a UNK UNK of UNK UNK which have yet to become clearly UNK from one another STOP
START sometimes it is not a verbal UNK -- a `` how are you now '' ? ? STOP
START or an `` i want to go home '' , or whatever -- but a UNK one which reveals itself , gradually , as the UNK expression of more than one UNK meaning STOP
START a UNK man used to give a UNK wave of his hand a number of times during his UNK hours with his therapist STOP
START when the therapist came to feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him , `` what is that , bill -- UNK or UNK '' ? ? STOP
START , the patient replied , `` both , UNK -- two in one '' STOP
START of all the possible forms of UNK expression , that which seems best to give release , and UNK expression , to complex and UNK feelings is UNK STOP
START it is no UNK that the UNK patient , the most severely UNK of all UNK patients , shows , as one of his characteristic UNK , UNK -- UNK which now makes one feel UNK or UNK , which now makes one feel like UNK , or which now gives one a UNK of the UNK and empty UNK of man's despair ; ; STOP
START and which , more often than all these , UNK a UNK of feelings which could in no way be UNK by any number of words , words which are so unlike this UNK in being formed and UNK from one another STOP
START to a much less full extent , the UNK UNK UNK or UNK has a comparable UNK function ; ; STOP
START in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private UNK over of the possible meaning of a UNK , or the passage of UNK , not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to UNK , but also because he UNK that even these UNK sounds constitute forms of communication in which , from time to time , quite different things are being said , long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these , as distinct feelings and concepts , to say them in words STOP
START as i have been UNK , in the UNK -- and perhaps also in the dreams of the UNK ; ; STOP
START this is a question which i have no wish to take up -- UNK is a phenomenon in which one finds not a UNK expression of various feelings and ideas which are , at an unconscious level , well UNK out , but rather a UNK expression of feelings and ideas which , even in the unconscious , have yet to become well UNK from one another STOP
START UNK , UNK and UNK , in their description of the UNK of thinking found in UNK UNK patients , say , in regard to UNK , that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment , and the objects contained UNK in itself is the UNK UNK '' STOP
START in my experience , a great many of the patient's more UNK verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become UNK from UNK meanings in his subjective experience STOP
START thus he may be referring to some concrete thing , or incident , in his immediate environment by some UNK , UNK reference to UNK events on the UNK scene STOP
START recently , for example , a UNK UNK UNK UNK , in the session , about the UNK UNK which has become , in her opinion , a UNK characteristic of UNK human culture , developed itself , before the end of the session , into a suspicion that i was UNK UNK at her partially exposed UNK , as indeed i was STOP
START or , equally often , a UNK , UNK statement may consist , with its UNK UNK , in a form of poetry -- may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a UNK expression : a UNK , a smile , an UNK , or some other symbolic mode of speaking STOP
START of such UNK meanings the patient himself is , more often than not , entirely UNK STOP
START his subjective experience may be a remarkably UNK one STOP
START one UNK women UNK to me , `` i live in a world of words '' , as if , to her , words were fully concrete objects ; ; STOP
START UNK , in his excellent article ( 1955 ) concerning UNK communication , includes mention of similar clinical material STOP
START a UNK UNK young man told me that to him the various theoretical concepts about which he had been UNK , in a most UNK fashion , during session after session with me , were like great UNK of almost UNK solid matter up in the air above him ; ; STOP
START as he spoke i was reminded of the great UNK of UNK which are UNK , high in the air , from a UNK UNK STOP
START the many UNK techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all UNK the UNK UNK around UNK , stems , UNK , etc STOP
START a significant reduction in the UNK of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly UNK language such as russian STOP
START for english the reduction in size is less striking STOP
START this approach requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entries , and ( 2 ) the information UNK from several entries in the dictionary be UNK into a description of the particular word STOP
START the logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file STOP
START UNK of the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis STOP
START we suggest the application of certain UNK techniques as a solution to the problem STOP
START but first , we must define two terms so that their meaning will be clearly understood : form -- any unique sequence of UNK characters that can appear in a language UNK and followed by a space ; ; STOP
START occurrence -- an instance of a form in text STOP
START we UNK a method for selecting only dictionary information required by the text being UNK and a means for passing the information directly to the UNK in text STOP
START we accomplish this by UNK a list of text forms as text is read by the UNK STOP
START a UNK scheme , based on the UNK of forms , provides an economical way to UNK this UNK list STOP
START dictionary forms found to match forms in the text list are marked STOP
START a location in the UNK store is also named for each marked form ; ; STOP
START dictionary information about the form stored at this location can be UNK directly by UNK of the form in text STOP
START finally , information is UNK from the dictionary as required by stages of the translation process -- the UNK description for UNK determination , UNK information for UNK analysis , and UNK UNK for output construction STOP
START the dictionary is a form dictionary , at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching text UNK with dictionary entries STOP
START also , the dictionary is divided into at least two parts : the list of dictionary forms and the file of information that UNK to these forms STOP
START a more detailed description of dictionary operations -- text UNK and dictionary UNK -- gives a UNK picture STOP
START text UNK , as we will describe it , consists of three steps STOP
START the first is UNK a list of text forms , UNK an information cell to each , and UNK text UNK with the information cell assigned to the form of each occurrence STOP
START for this step the UNK memory is separated into three regions : cells in the UNK are used for storage of the forms in the UNK list ; ; STOP
START cells in the UNK and UNK region are reserved as information cells for text forms STOP
START when an occurrence af is isolated during text reading , a random memory address af , the address of a cell in the UNK , is computed from the form of af STOP
START let af UNK the form of af STOP
START if cell af has not previously been assigned as the information cell of a form in the UNK list , it is now assigned as the information cell of af STOP
START the form itself is stored in the next available cells of the UNK , beginning in cell af STOP
START the address af and the number of cells required to store the form are written in af ; ; STOP
START the information cell af is saved to represent the text occurrence STOP
START text reading continues with the next occurrence STOP
START let us assume that af is identical to the form of an occurrence af which UNK af in the text STOP
START when this situation exists , the address af will equal af which was produced from af STOP
START if af was assigned as the information cell for af , the routine can UNK that af is identical to af by UNK af with the form stored at location af STOP
START the address af is stored in the cell af STOP
START when , as in this case , the two forms match , the address af is saved to represent the occurrence af STOP
START text reading continues with the next occurrence STOP
START a third situation is possible STOP
START the formula for computing random addresses from the form of each occurrence will not give a distinct address for each distinct form STOP
START thus , when more than one distinct form leads to a particular cell in the UNK , a chain of information cells must be created to UNK the forms , one cell in the chain for each form STOP
START if af leads to an address af that is equal to the address computed from af , even though af does not match af , the chain of information cells is extended from af by UNK the address of the next available cell in the UNK , af , in af STOP
START the cell af becomes the second information cell in the chain and is assigned as the information cell of af STOP
START a third cell can be added by UNK the address of another UNK in af ; ; STOP
START similarly , as many cells are added as are required STOP
START each information cell in the chain contains the address of the UNK where the form to which it is assigned is stored STOP
START each cell except the last in the chain also contains the address of the UNK that is the next element of the chain ; ; STOP
START the absence of such a UNK in the last cell indicates the end of the chain STOP
START hence , when the address af is computed from af , the cell af and all UNK in its chain must be UNK to determine whether af is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form list and the chain STOP
START when the information cell for af has been determined , it is saved as a representation of af STOP
START text reading continues with the next occurrence STOP
START text reading is UNK when a UNK number of forms have been stored in the UNK list STOP
START this UNK the second step of UNK UNK -- UNK the information cell of forms in the UNK list to dictionary forms STOP
START each form represented by the dictionary is looked up in the UNK list STOP
START each time a dictionary form UNK a text form , the information cell of the matching text form is saved STOP
START the number of dictionary forms UNK since the last one UNK is also saved STOP
START these two pieces of information for each dictionary form that is UNK by a text form constitute the table of dictionary usage STOP
START if each text form is marked when UNK with a dictionary form , the text forms not contained in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have been read STOP
START the appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken at that time STOP
START each dictionary form is looked up in the UNK list by the same method used to look up a new text occurrence in the form list during text reading STOP
START a random address af that lies within the UNK of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the UNK dictionary form STOP
START if cell af is an information cell , it and any information cells in the UNK that have been linked to af each contain an address in the UNK where a UNK matching form is stored STOP
START the dictionary form is compared with each of these text forms STOP
START when a match is found , an entry is made in the table of dictionary usage STOP
START if cell af is not an information cell we conclude that the UNK dictionary form is not in the text list STOP
START these two steps essentially complete the UNK operation STOP
START the final step merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that UNK to each form UNK in the UNK list , and uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to UNK the appropriate information to each occurrence in text STOP
START the list of text forms in the UNK of memory and the UNK of the information cells in the x and UNK are no longer required STOP
START only the assignment of the information cells is important STOP
START the first stage of translation after UNK UNK is structural analysis of the input text STOP
START the UNK description of each occurrence in the text must be UNK from the dictionary to permit such an analysis STOP
START a description of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be UNK from the dictionary and attached to each text occurrence STOP
START the UNK UNK of all forms in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary file STOP
START the order is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe STOP
START when entries are being UNK from this file , the table of dictionary usage indicates which entries to UNK and which entries to store in the UNK STOP
START this UNK process takes place as the file is read STOP
START each entry that is selected for storage is written into the next available cells of the aj STOP
START the address of the first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information cell for the form STOP
START ( the address of the information cell is also supplied by the table of dictionary usage STOP
START ) when the complete file has been read , the UNK UNK for all text forms found in the dictionary have been stored in the UNK ; ; STOP
START the information cell assigned to each text form contains the address of the UNK description of the form it represents STOP
START hence , the description of each text occurrence can be UNK by reading the list of UNK UNK addresses and UNK the description indicated by the information cell for each occurrence STOP
START the only requirements on dictionary information made by the UNK operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for UNK in the UNK list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms STOP
START this leaves the ordering of entries variable STOP
START ( here an entry is a form plus the information that UNK to it STOP
START ) STOP
START two very useful ways for UNK a UNK are the addition to the dictionary of complete UNK rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more than one dictionary form STOP
START the former is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage STOP
START the latter is useful for UNK information about some or all forms of a word , hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary UNK STOP
START applying the techniques developed at harvard for UNK a UNK from a representative form and its classification , we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at once STOP
START an extension of the principle would permit entering a UNK description of each form STOP
START UNK could be assigned to the UNK either at the time it is added to the dictionary or after the word has been studied in context STOP
START thus , one can think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form STOP
START if all forms of a UNK are UNK together within the dictionary , a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible STOP
START for example , the UNK forms of a word can be represented , UNK as regular UNK allows , by a stem and a set of UNK to be attached STOP
START ( indeed , the set of UNK can be replaced by the name of a set of UNK STOP
START ) the full forms can be derived from such information just prior to the UNK of the form in the UNK list STOP
START similarly , if the UNK for the forms of a word do not vary , the UNK need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form STOP
START the dictionary system is in no way dependent upon such UNK or designed around it STOP
START when UNK and variation prevent UNK , information is written in complete detail STOP
START entries are UNK only when by doing so the amount of information retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary operations is UNK STOP
START in UNK , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here STOP
START the tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end STOP
START there is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in UNK UNK UNK STOP
START thus the first lines of one of charles UNK UNK are as follows STOP
START `` a charge to keep i have , a god to UNK '' STOP
START in the UNK to which this UNK is most often UNK , `` UNK '' , the UNK have and UNK , ending their lines , have twice the time any other UNK have STOP
START dominant stress is of course more than extended UNK , and normally centers on UNK that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to UNK would normally center on its first UNK rather than its last STOP
START but the parallel is significant STOP
START when the answer to UNK wrong now ? ? STOP
START is UNK broken a chair , dominant stress will usually be on the complement a chair STOP
START from the point of view of UNK analysis the head word in the statement is the UNK has broken , and from the point of view of meaning it would seem that the trouble centers in the breaking ; ; STOP
START but dominant stress will be assigned to broken only in rather exceptional UNK of the sentence STOP
START in i know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing ; ; STOP
START in one thing i know it will usually be on the UNK know STOP
START in UNK people are very friendly dominant stress will generally be on the complement very friendly ; ; STOP
START in the double sentence the smaller the town , the UNK the people it will generally be on the subjects the town and the people STOP
START in UNK a UNK ? ? STOP
START dominant stress will generally be on the subject a UNK ; ; STOP
START in UNK a UNK ? it will generally be on the complement a UNK STOP
START dominant stress is on her UNK both in that's her UNK , where her UNK is the complement , and in there's her UNK , where it is the subject STOP
START UNK second UNK , however , are likely not to have dominant stress when they UNK UNK STOP
START if the answer to what was that noise ? ? STOP
START is george put the UNK out , dominant stress will UNK be on the first complement , the UNK , not the second complement out STOP
START final UNK may or may not have dominant stress STOP
START if the answer to what was that noise ? ? STOP
START is george UNK the news UNK , dominant stress may or may not be on the UNK UNK STOP
START when UNK UNK are divided as in what are you looking for ? ? STOP
START they are likely to lose dominant stress STOP
START context is of extreme importance STOP
START what is new in the context is likely to be made more prominent than what is not STOP
START thus in a context in which there has been discussion of snow but mention of local conditions is new , dominant stress will probably be on here in it rarely UNK here , but in a context in which there has been discussion of local weather but no mention of snow , dominant stress will probably be on UNK STOP
START the personal UNK and substitute one are normally UNK because they refer to what is prominent in the immediate context STOP
START in i'll go with george dominant stress is probably on george ; ; STOP
START but if george has just been mentioned UNK ( and the trip to be made has been under discussion ) , what is said is probably i'll go with him , and dominant stress is probably on the UNK with STOP
START when a gesture UNK UNK he ? ? STOP
START the personal UNK has dominant stress because `` he '' has not been mentioned previously STOP
START if both george and a piece of information george does not have are prominent in the context , but the idea of telling george is new , then dominant stress will probably be on tell in why not tell george ? ? STOP
START but when what is new in a particular context is also fairly obvious , there is normally only light stress or no stress at all STOP
START thus the UNK it of it rarely UNK here gets its significance from its use with UNK : nothing can snow snow but `` it '' STOP
START in there aren't many young people in the neighborhood the UNK young takes dominant stress away from its head people : the fact that the young creatures of interest are people seems rather obvious STOP
START if women replaced people , it would normally have dominant stress STOP
START in i have things to do the word things makes little real contribution to meaning and has UNK stress than do STOP
START if work is substituted for things ( with more exact contribution to meaning ) , it will have dominant stress STOP
START in i know one thing dominant stress is likely to go to one rather than to UNK pale thing STOP
START in i knew you when you were a child , and you were pretty then dominant stress on then implies that the young woman spoken to is still pretty STOP
START dominant stress on pretty would be almost UNK here STOP
START in the written language then can be UNK or UNK to guide the reader here , but much of the time the written language simply depends on the UNK UNK , and a UNK reader will have to back up and UNK STOP
START often , dominant stress simply indicates a UNK of attention or emotion STOP
START thus in it's incredible what that boy can eat dominant stress is likely to be on incredible , and eat will have strong stress also STOP
START in she has it in for george dominant stress will UNK be on in , where the notion of UNK UNK seems to center STOP
START in UNK painting at our UNK strong stress on at indicates that the job being done is not real painting but simply an effort at painting STOP
START where there is comparison or contrast , dominant stresses normally operate to center attention STOP
START thus in his friends are UNK than his UNK strong stresses are normal for his and UNK , but in his friends are UNK than his UNK strong stresses are normal for friends and UNK STOP
START in he's UNK himself more than he's UNK you both himself and you have stronger stress than they would UNK have if there were no contrast STOP
START in is she chinese or japanese ? ? STOP
START the desire to contrast the first parts of words which are alike in their last components produces an exceptional UNK of the normal patterns of stress of chinese and japanese STOP
START sometimes strong stress serves to focus an important secondary relationship STOP
START thus in mary wrote an account of the trip first strong stress on mary marks mary as the first in a series of people who wrote accounts of the trip , strong stress on wrote marks the writing as the first of a series of actions of UNK concerned with an account of her trip ( about which she may later have made speeches , for example ) , and strong stress on trip makes the trip the first of a series of subjects about which mary wrote accounts STOP
START in hunger UNK man too the situation is very similar STOP
START strong stress on hunger UNK hunger as an additional stimulus , strong stress on UNK UNK UNK as an additional effect of hunger , strong stress on man UNK man as an additional UNK who UNK to the UNK of hunger STOP
START here again , in the written language it is possible to help the reader get his stresses right by using UNK or UNK , but much of the time there is simply UNK on his understanding in the light of context STOP
START when a word represents a larger construction of which it is the only expressed part , it normally has more stress than it would have in fully expressed construction STOP
START thus when yes , i have is the response to have you finished reading the paper ? ? STOP
START the stress on have , which here represents have finished reading the paper , is quite strong STOP
START in UNK the leader at camp , but UNK is here the is of the second main UNK represents is the leader and therefore has stress STOP
START UNK the leader at camp , but UNK here , with this is UNK of stress , makes here the complement in the UNK STOP
START in of all the suggestions that were made , his was the UNK the UNK his represents his suggestion and is stressed STOP
START when go represents itself and a complement ( being equivalent , say , to go to UNK ) in which boat did UNK go on ? ? STOP
START it has strong stress ; ; STOP
START when it represents only itself and on which is its complement ( so that go on is UNK equivalent to board ) , on has stronger stress than go does STOP
START UNK of a UNK UNK , however , does not result in an increase in stress on a UNK UNK for which the UNK UNK would be object STOP
START thus to has light stress both in that was the conclusion that i came to and in that was the conclusion i came to STOP
START but when to represents to consciousness in that was the moment that i came to , and similarly in that was the moment i came to , there is much stronger stress on to STOP
START in i wanted to tell him , but i was afraid to the final to is lightly stressed because it represents to tell him STOP
START in to tell him , of course , to is normally UNK STOP
START when i have instructions to leave is equivalent in meaning to i have instructions that i am to leave this place , dominant stress is UNK on leave STOP
START when the same sequence is equivalent in meaning to i have instructions which i am to leave , dominant stress is UNK on instructions STOP
START it is clear that patterns of stress sometimes show construction UNK in the spoken language where without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written STOP
START other examples follow STOP
START `` i'll come by UNK STOP

START in the first of these UNK if by is the complement of come and UNK is an UNK of time equivalent to on UNK , there will be strong stress on by in the spoken language ; ; STOP
START but if a complement for come is implied and by UNK is a UNK unit used as an UNK , by will be UNK or lightly stressed at most STOP
START in the second sentence if drinking water is a UNK UNK and without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless i drink water , there will be stronger stress on water than on drinking ; ; STOP
START but if drinking is a UNK UNK UNK water and without drinking water is equivalent to without water for drinking , there will be stronger stress on drinking than on water STOP
START but the use of stress in comparison and contrast , for example , can UNK distinctions such as these STOP
START and patterns of stress are not always UNK by any means STOP
START in the UNK have busy lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives or to relatives who are visiting them , and in i looked up the number and i looked up the UNK only the meanings of number and UNK make it clear that up is UNK a second complement in the first sentence and a UNK followed by its object in the second STOP
START UNK STOP
START -- UNK are UNK units UNK in UNK which are usually UNK but , as has been noted , are UNK under certain circumstances , and which may or may not be combined with preceding and following UNK or combinations of UNK STOP
START UNK are genuine units , but division of words and UNK into them presents great difficulties STOP
START sometimes even the number of UNK is not clear STOP
START doubt on this point is strongest before and UNK or STOP
START from the point of view of word formation real might be expected to have two UNK STOP
START historically UNK is the UNK that is employed also in republic , and UNK is the common UNK STOP
START when UNK is added , real clearly has two UNK STOP
START but there is every reason to regard deal as a UNK , and because of the fact that commonly has the quality of UNK when it follows UNK sounds , deal seems to be a perfectly satisfactory UNK with deal STOP
START it is obvious enough that UNK in general have been less successful in UNK with tone systems than with UNK or UNK STOP
START no single explanation is adequate to account for this STOP
START improvement , however , is UNK , and at least three things will be needed STOP
START the first is a UNK sample of successful UNK analyses STOP
START even beginning students in UNK are made familiar with an UNK variety of UNK systems , both in their general UNK and in many specific details STOP
START an advanced student has read a considerable number of UNK of UNK systems , including some of the more unusual types STOP
START by contrast , even experienced UNK commonly know no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the UNK distinction between register and UNK languages STOP
START this limited UNK with the possible phenomena has severely UNK work with tone STOP
START tone analysis will continue to be difficult and UNK until a more representative selection of systems is UNK to every UNK field UNK STOP
START papers like these four , if widely read , will contribute UNK to improvement of our analytic work STOP
START the second need is better field techniques STOP
START the great majority of present-day UNK fall into one or more of a number of UNK types : those who are convinced that tone cannot be UNK , those who are personally UNK of tone and tone languages generally , those who are convinced that tone is merely an UNK marginal feature in those languages where it occurs , those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis , those who take a UNK view of the whole matter STOP
START the result has been UNK , UNK efforts , or UNK treatment STOP
START as these UNK UNK , so must the cure STOP
START analyses such as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone is impossible and that it is simple STOP
START they will give suggestions that can be worked up into field procedures STOP
START good field techniques will not only UNK UNK for better work , but also help them overcome negative attitudes STOP
START actually , none of these papers says much directly about field techniques STOP
START but it is worth UNK that very little has been published on any phase of field techniques in UNK STOP
START these things have been UNK by other means , but always in the UNK of extensive publication of analytic results STOP
START the third need is for better theory STOP
START we should expect that general UNK theory should be as adequate for tone as for UNK and UNK , but it has not been STOP
START this can only be for one of two reasons : either the two are quite different and will require UNK different theory ( and hence techniques ) , or our existing theories are UNK general STOP
START if , as i suspect , the problem is largely of the second sort , then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all UNK UNK STOP
START one issue that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different UNK UNK STOP
START since tone systems typically UNK fewer units than either UNK or UNK systems , we might expect that they would be the UNK part of a UNK analysis STOP
START actual practice does not often work out this way STOP
START tone systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest , and often UNK more difficult than much larger UNK systems STOP
START UNK has suggested one explanation STOP
START tone languages use for UNK UNK speech UNK which also function heavily in UNK use STOP
START this may both UNK the attention of the UNK and cause confusion for the more UNK STOP
START the problem is to UNK the UNK features of pitch from the UNK UNK features STOP
START of course , something of the same sort occurs with other UNK of the UNK : UNK UNK have both a UNK and an individual component STOP
START but in general the individual variation is a small thing added onto basic UNK features of greater magnitude STOP
START with tone , individual differences may be greater than the UNK UNK which are UNK on them STOP
START pitch differences from one speaker to another , or from one emotional state to another , may far exceed the small differences between UNK STOP
START however , any such suggestion accounts for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone , or in developing a realistic attitude about tone , but not for the analytic difficulties that occur even when tone is UNK recorded STOP
START a second explanation is suggested by the material described in UNK paper STOP
START tone and UNK often become seriously UNK STOP
START neither can be adequately UNK until we are able to separate the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the other STOP
START other pairs of UNK UNK also UNK or UNK in this way ; ; STOP
START for example , UNK sometimes figures in both the UNK system and the UNK STOP
START some UNK features , for example UNK catch or UNK , are sometimes to be assigned to UNK UNK and sometimes to UNK systems STOP
START but no other two UNK systems are as difficult to UNK as are tone and UNK in some languages STOP
START this explanation of tone difficulties , however , does not apply in all languages STOP
START in some ( the UNK type mentioned above ) interaction of tone and UNK is UNK to the ends of UNK UNK STOP
START in many of the UNK , UNK can be UNK ignored , and much of the UNK analysis can be done without any study of UNK STOP
START still , even in such languages tone analysis has not been as simple as one might expect STOP
START a third explanation is suggested by UNK analysis of UNK tone STOP
START there we see a basically simple UNK system UNK in a very complex and UNK UNK system STOP
START while the UNK can be very easily stated , no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement until UNK UNK can be related in some way to UNK units , UNK the UNK is worked out , or at least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success STOP
START in the `` typical tone language '' , UNK UNK is of the same order of UNK as UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK systems which must support these UNK systems , however , are very different STOP
START the inventory of UNK is much smaller , and commonly the UNK range along one single UNK , pitch level STOP
START UNK systems are not merely larger , they are UNK STOP
START UNK rules may be thought of as UNK certain points in the system STOP
START the possibilities in the UNK system are very numerous , and only a small portion of them are actually used STOP
START UNK connected by a UNK rule commonly show a good bit of UNK UNK , possible because of the several dimensions of contrast in the system STOP
START UNK UNK , in a common case , can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone STOP
START the possibilities are few , and the total number of rules may be considerably greater STOP
START often , therefore , there are a number of rules having the same effect , and commonly other sets of rules as well , having the opposite effect STOP
START UNK UNK is much more UNK to the beginning UNK than UNK UNK , even when the total number of rules is no greater STOP
START the difficulty of analysis of any UNK in the UNK is an UNK function of the size -- smaller systems are more UNK -- for any given degree of UNK UNK STOP
START this hypothesis will account for a large part of the difficulties of UNK analysis , as well as the fact that UNK systems are often more UNK than UNK systems STOP
START the statement of the system is a different matter STOP
START smaller systems can of course be stated much more UNK STOP
START a UNK system can be stated without reference to UNK , but it cannot always be found without UNK STOP
START and the more complex the UNK system is in relation to the UNK base , the less easily a UNK system will be UNK without close attention to the UNK -- at least , the less UNK will a UNK statement be if it cannot be related through UNK rules to UNK meaningful structures STOP
START the design of UNK has received much less attention from UNK than the problem UNK STOP
START there has been a tendency on the part of many american UNK to assume that a UNK UNK will automatically be the best possible UNK and that the only real problem will then be the social one of UNK acceptance STOP
START this seems naive STOP
START most others have been content to give only the most general attention to the UNK and most obvious features of the UNK when UNK UNK STOP
START apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical UNK of possible UNK interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs STOP
START the result of this attitude has been the domination of many UNK conferences by such considerations as UNK ' UNK ' , which usually turns out to be nothing more than certain UNK carried over from european languages STOP
START many of the suggested systems seem to have only the most UNK relationship to the language structures that they UNK to represent STOP
START UNK have not always been more UNK than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insisted on UNK UNK points while UNK things of much greater significance STOP
START as a result , many people have been UNK in their conviction that UNK design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion STOP
START UNK , in UNK and UNK in UNK , UNK one set of related UNK questions and its UNK background in detail STOP
START his objective is merely to determine `` what distinctions of length and UNK it may be desirable to make explicit in a UNK UNK '' ( UNK ) STOP
START to do so , he finds it necessary to examine the relevant parts of the UNK thoroughly and in detail STOP
START in the process , he UNK some very significant observations about problems of a sort that are often difficult STOP
START a few of his examples are of very great interest , and the whole discussion of some importance for theory STOP
START his UNK recommendations are no UNK acceptance of UNK on the one hand or of UNK on the other STOP
START rather he UNK each UNK fact in the light of its UNK UNK STOP
START he UNK that some changes can be made in the current UNK which will UNK improve its UNK , but UNK to suggest precise UNK devices to effect these changes STOP
START i hope his suggestions are given the consideration they UNK in UNK circles STOP
START this , however , will not UNK their practical UNK , as they rather clearly indicate what thorough UNK investigation can contribute to UNK design STOP
START we need many more studies of this sort if the design of written languages is to be put on a sound basis STOP
START one other paper deals with a UNK problem : UNK harmony in UNK , by UNK STOP
START this UNK the already widely known facts in terms of UNK STOP
START as a UNK it makes only a small contribution to knowledge of UNK STOP
START but it would seem more intended as a UNK UNK the UNK theory than a paper directed to the specific problems of UNK UNK STOP
START the paper has a certain value as a comparatively easy introduction to this approach , particularly since it UNK a fairly simple and UNK phenomenon where it is possible to compare it with a more traditional ( though not structural ) statement STOP
START it does show one feature of the system that has not been previously described STOP
START but it does not , as it claims , demonstrate that this could not be treated by traditional methods STOP
START it seems to me that it rather easily can STOP
START five of the papers deal with UNK problems STOP
START on the whole they maintain much the same high standard , but they are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider variety of subject matter STOP
START my comments must be UNK than the papers UNK STOP
START UNK writes on the verbal radical in UNK STOP
START this must be considered primarily an UNK and supplement to his early a short description of UNK in UNK STOP
START it exhibits much the same UNK technique and is open to much the same UNK STOP
START the treatment seems UNK UNK and complex , largely because the method is UNK and the analysis seems never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent UNK STOP
START there are more stems per item in athabascan , which UNK the fact that the athabascan languages have UNK somewhat more change in UNK from UNK than the UNK languages from UNK STOP
START this may be because the athabascan UNK began earlier ; ; STOP
START or again because the athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; STOP
START or both STOP
START the UNK , however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that athabascan shows UNK stems per meaning UNK as against UNK for UNK , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21 STOP
START ( on UNK of UNK from UNK , the stem item rate becomes UNK against UNK in equivalent number of languages STOP
START ) these general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison STOP
START the greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used STOP
START these differences in turn result from the fact that my UNK UNK were built up of terms selected mainly to insure UNK of english meaning between UNK UNK and myself , within a UNK and uniform territorial area , but that UNK UNK is based on UNK second UNK list which aims at UNK all items which might be UNK or UNK determined STOP
START UNK in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal ; ; STOP
START i , one that was specifically adapted to the san UNK valley STOP
START the result is that i included 70 animal names , but UNK only 4 ; ; STOP
START and somewhat similarly for plants , 16 as against 4 STOP
START UNK , and therefore UNK , felt compelled to UNK all terms UNK species or even UNK ( UNK , UNK , UNK , yellow UNK , UNK ) ; ; STOP
START their classes of animal and plant terms are UNK to UNK or UNK parts ( fish , bird , tree , grass , horn , tail , UNK , root ) STOP
START the groups are therefore really UNK in content as well as in size STOP
START other classes are included only by myself ( UNK , UNK ) or only by UNK and UNK ( UNK , UNK ) STOP
START what we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes : ( 1 ) body parts and products , which with a UNK nearly even representation ( UNK terms out of UNK , 25 out of 100 ) come out with nearly even ratios ; ; STOP
START UNK and UNK ; ; STOP
START ( 2 ) nature ( 29 terms against 17 ) , ratios UNK UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START ( 3 ) UNK ( 16 , 15 terms ) , ratios UNK UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START ( 4 ) UNK ( 9 , 22 terms ) , ratios UNK UNK UNK STOP
START it will be seen that where the scope is similar , the athabascan ratios come out somewhat higher ( as indeed they ought to with a total ratio of UNK as against UNK or 4 : 5 ) except for UNK , where alone the athabascan ratio is lower STOP
START this exception may be connected with UNK use of a much higher percentage of UNK : UNK of his total list as against UNK in mine STOP
START or the exception may be due to a particular UNK peculiar to the athabascan UNK STOP
START more word class ratios determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the question STOP
START 5 STOP
START if word classes differ in their resistance or UNK to stem replacement within meaning UNK , it is UNK that individual meanings also differ with fair UNK UNK STOP
START UNK athabascan and my UNK share UNK identical meanings ( with allowance for several UNK like UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK ) STOP
START for UNK , i UNK these UNK items in five columns , according as they were expressed by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and more than 4 stems STOP
START the UNK for these five categories are not too UNK , namely 20 , 15 , 11 , 16 , 9 respectively STOP
START for athabascan , with a greater range of stems , the first two of five corresponding columns were identical , 1 and 2 stems ; ; STOP
START the three others had to be spread somewhat , and are headed respectively af ; ; STOP
START af ; ; STOP
START and af stems STOP
START while the particular limits of these UNK may seem UNK arbitrary , they do fairly express a corresponding UNK of more variable material , and they UNK also in five classes , along a similar scale , containing approximately equal numbers of cases , namely 19 , 14 , 15 , 11 , 12 in athabascan STOP
START when now we count the frequency of the UNK items in the two language families UNK in the same column or grade , or one column or grade apart , or two or three or four , we find these differences : af STOP
START STOP
START this distribution can be UNK by UNK the distance in grades apart : af ; ; STOP
START which , divided by af gives a mean of UNK grades apart STOP
START if the distribution of the UNK items were wholly UNK in the two families , the distance would of course be 0 STOP
START if it were wholly random and UNK , it would be UNK , assuming the five classes were equal in n , which approximately they are STOP
START the actual mean of UNK being about UNK between 0 of complete correlation and UNK of no correlation , it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of UNK in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning as UNK long-term stem displacement STOP
START 6 STOP
START in 1960 , david UNK published basic UNK in some UNK languages ( UNK 2 , UNK , UNK - 11 ) , which UNK 8 UNK languages with the UNK language data on which UNK based the revised retention rate ( af ) in place of original ( af ) , and his revised 100 word basic UNK list in towards greater accuracy ( UNK 21 : : STOP
START UNK - UNK ) STOP
START UNK findings are , first , `` that the individual items vary greatly and UNK in their UNK '' ; ; STOP
START but , second , `` that the UNK groups are surprisingly UNK in their average UNK '' ( as between UNK and UNK ) STOP
START his first conclusion , on behavior of individual items , is negative , whereas mine ( on UNK UNK was partially positive STOP
START his second conclusion , on UNK word classes , UNK with mine STOP
START this second conclusion , independently arrived at by independent study of material from two pairs of language families as different and remote from one another as these four are , cannot be ignored STOP
START thomas also presents a simple equation for UNK an index of UNK , which weights not only the number of stems ( ' roots ' ) per meaning , but their relative frequency STOP
START thus his UNK values for some stem frequencies per meaning are : stem identical in 8 languages , UNK ; ; STOP
START stem frequencies 7 and 1 , UNK ; ; STOP
START stem frequencies 4 and 4 , UNK ; ; STOP
START stem frequencies 4 , 3 , and 1 , UNK STOP
START his formula will have to be weighed , may be altered or improved , and it should be tested on additional bodies of material STOP
START but consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with UNK and UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START and UNK presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area STOP
START as to relative frequencies of UNK roots ( 7 - 1 UNK - 4 , UNK , thomas with his ' UNK ' seems to be the first to have considered the significance this might have STOP
START the problem needs further exploration STOP
START i was at least conscious of the distinction in my full UNK presentation that UNK publication , in which , in UNK ' UNK meanings ' , i set off by UNK those forms in which n of stem b was af of stem a , the UNK ones standing for af ; ; STOP
START or under ' four stems ' , i set off by UNK cases where the combined n of stems af was af STOP
START 7 STOP
START these findings , and others which will in time be developed , will affect the method of UNK inquiry STOP
START if UNK meanings show relatively low UNK of stems , as i am UNK will prove to be the case in most languages of the world , why should our basic lists include 15 per cent of these UNK forms , but only 8 per cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly ? ? STOP
START had UNK substituted for his 15 UNK UNK 15 good animal and plant items , his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of athabascan language separation smaller STOP
START and UNK of the outcome in centuries UNK since UNK , UNK obviously carry more UNK and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with UNK UNK ones STOP
START it is evident that UNK has not only had much experience with basic UNK in many languages but has acquired great UNK and feeling for the UNK behavior of UNK items STOP
START why then this urge to include UNK items in his basic list ? ? STOP
START it is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible STOP
START and why that UNK ? ? STOP
START it is the hope of UNK a list of items of universal occurrence STOP
START but it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is a UNK STOP
START not that such a list cannot be constructed ; ; STOP
START but the UNK it comes to UNK UNK , the less significant will it be UNK STOP
START its terms will tend to be UNK or vague , and they will fit actual languages more and more badly STOP
START the practical operational problem of UNK is the establishment of a basic list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms of languages can be UNK as the medium of comparison STOP
START the most important quality of the meanings is that they should be as UNK as possible STOP
START in proportion as meanings are concrete , we can better UNK on their being UNK and distinctive STOP
START an UNK or a UNK or a UNK or a UNK or a UNK possess in UNK high degree this quality of obvious , UNK , UNK identity , as do an eye or tooth or UNK STOP
START they UNK out easily , naturally , and UNK from the UNK of nature and existence ; ; STOP
START and they should be given UNK in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities STOP
START with the universal list as his weapon , UNK has extended his march of UNK farther and farther into the past , eight , ten , twelve UNK back STOP
START and he has UNK greater or less UNK between all western UNK languages STOP
START some of this may prove to be true , or even considerable of it , whether by UNK UNK or by diffusion and UNK STOP
START but the farther out he moves , the UNK will be his hold on UNK evidence , and the larger the UNK component in his UNK STOP
START he has UNK UNK and UNK , but he has not UNK them behind him , nor does he control them STOP
START he has announced results on UNK , UNK , UNK , and almost all other american families and UNK , and has UNK their degree of UNK ; ; STOP
START but he has not worked out by UNK one UNK complete classification of even a single family other than UNK STOP
START that is his privilege STOP
START the remote , UNK , possible has values of its own -- values of scope , stimulus , potential , and imagination STOP
START but there is also a firm aspect to UNK : the aspect of learning the internal organization of obvious natural UNK groups of languages as well as their more remote and UNK external UNK ; ; STOP
START of classification first , with UNK age merely a UNK ; ; STOP
START of UNK UNK knowledge of what happened in athabascan , in UNK , in UNK in the last few thousand years as well as UNK what more UNK may have happened between them STOP
START this involves UNK progress , and such will have to be the UNK work of UNK as a growing body of scientific inquiry STOP
START if of the UNK of UNK UNK has UNK our steady UNK , and UNK has UNK his own share in the founding , that is no reason why we should UNK STOP
START 8 STOP
START there is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by UNK rules and procedure since his UNK and aims have grown so vast STOP
START it seems time to consider a UNK of operational procedures for UNK studies on a more humble , solid , and limited basis STOP
START i would UNK , first , an UNK of attempts at a universal UNK list , as UNK UNK , and UNK inadequate in proportion as it is achieved STOP
START i would UNK , next , as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists , items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible STOP
START there would be no UNK sense in going to the opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are the most UNK STOP
START an attempted middle course might lead to devices like a UNK UNK dictionary from which every UNK word was selected STOP
START UNK it was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies STOP
START it was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after yalta there should be a complete split over germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the germans against their former allies , and with UNK germans UNK to UNK their power by fighting on one side or the other STOP

START the long delay in opening the second front was now working to UNK advantage STOP
START the west was now UNK to UNK the UNK UNK line , which was substantially UNK UNK UNK , as the boundary between russia and poland STOP
START when this proposal was made , UNK spoke with stronger emotion than at any other time during the conference STOP

START `` you would drive us into UNK '' , he declared STOP
START the white russians and the UNK would say that UNK and UNK were far less reliable UNK of russia than UNK and UNK STOP
START yet after long and earnest discussion UNK accepted the UNK line and even agreed UNK that there should be UNK from that line of five to eight UNK in favor of poland in some regions STOP
START he did not mind the line itself , which UNK declared in the house of UNK , on february 27 , 1945 , he had always believed to be `` just and right '' , but he did not want it called by a UNK name STOP
START the west had long since forgotten the events of UNK , but it was not so easy for the red leaders , who felt that they had suffered great injustice in that period STOP
START in the UNK UNK of february 4 , UNK , the state department had expected to be able to hold russia in check by UNK agreement to her UNK UNK STOP
START now UNK made it clear that he meant to move UNK western UNK deep into germany , back to the western UNK river lines , taking not only east UNK and all of UNK but UNK and the tip of UNK , back to and including UNK STOP
START from six to nine million additional germans would be UNK , though most would have fled , and poland would receive far more from germany than the poor UNK , including the great UNK UNK , which she lost to russia STOP
START UNK declared that he preferred to continue the war a little longer , `` although it costs us blood '' , in order to give poland compensation in the west at the expense of the germans STOP
START by this time UNK was not so UNK toward moving poland UNK as he had been at UNK , where he and UNK had both UNK approved the idea STOP
START after `` a prolonged study of the UNK line on a map '' , at UNK , UNK `` liked the picture '' STOP
START he would tell the UNK , he said , that they had been `` given a fine place to live in , more than three hundred miles each way '' STOP
START at yalta he thought more about the six million germans who would have to leave , trying to find work in germany , and roosevelt UNK to the western UNK river being chosen in the south , instead of the eastern UNK , both of which flow into the UNK STOP
START the issue was left in UNK , presumably for the peace conference STOP
START however , there was no real question of the justice of creating a strong poland , both UNK and UNK , and one UNK by large UNK of germans or russians STOP
START the moving of millions of the german UNK , from the very heart of UNK , to make room for the UNK UNK whom they had UNK and openly planned to UNK was a UNK operation , but there was little doubt that it was historically justified STOP
START government STOP
START of more importance to the west than UNK UNK was the character of her government STOP
START at yalta the west still believed that eastern europe could be kept in its orbit , in spite of the UNK soviet armies STOP
START though little democracy had ever been UNK in this region , and much of it was still ruled by UNK means , it was taken for granted that at least the forms of western democracy would be established in this area and western UNK preserved within it STOP
START UNK UNK as they did in anglo-saxon institutions , it was important to both roosevelt and UNK that the UNK should have them STOP
START the issue was UNK because the UNK UNK government in london , supported in the main by britain , was still UNK with the new UNK government formed behind the red army STOP
START more time was spent in trying to UNK these UNK than over any subject discussed at yalta STOP
START the result was an agreement that the UNK government should be `` UNK on a broader democratic basis with the UNK of democratic leaders from poland itself and from the UNK abroad '' , and UNK to hold `` free and UNK elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal UNK and secret UNK '' STOP
START all `` democratic and UNK parties '' were to have the right to campaign STOP
START roosevelt UNK as UNK of the long debate on this issue STOP
START it was a matter of principle with UNK , since britain had declared war in behalf of poland STOP
START to UNK it was a matter of life and death STOP
START he made this completely clear STOP
START speaking with `` great UNK '' , he said : `` for the russian people , the question of poland is not only a question of honor but also a question of security STOP
START throughout history , poland has been the UNK through which the enemy has passed into russia STOP
START twice in the last thirty years our enemies , the germans , have passed through this UNK STOP
START it is in UNK interest that poland should be strong and powerful , in a position to shut the door of this UNK by her own force STOP
START it is necessary that poland should be free , independent in power STOP
START therefore , it is not only a question of honor but of life and death for the soviet state '' STOP
START in other words , the soviet union was determined to create a poland so strong as to be a powerful UNK against germany and so closely tied to russia that there would never be any question of her serving as a UNK UNK against the UNK or UNK as an independent , UNK power in between russia and germany STOP
START UNK says that invariably thereafter the UNK used the same security argument to justify their course in poland STOP
START this UNK was also as inevitable as anything could be STOP
START any free elections that were to be held in poland would have to produce a government in which moscow had complete confidence , and all pressure from the west for free voting by UNK elements in poland would be met by restrictions on voting by these elements STOP
START 6 STOP
START UNK europe STOP
START in even greater degree the same rule applied to the remainder of eastern europe , where the upper classes had generally UNK with the UNK , even to the extent of sending millions of their UNK into russia as a part of UNK armies STOP
START but at yalta the UNK expectations of east and west were UNK into an agreement by the big three to assist all UNK countries in europe `` to create democratic institutions of their own choice '' STOP
START in any case `` here in their judgment conditions require '' ( UNK added ) they would `` form UNK governmental authorities UNK representative of all democratic elements in the population and UNK to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of governments UNK to the will of the people '' STOP
START other similar UNK in the declaration on UNK europe seemed to assure democratic institutions on the western model STOP
START later it developed that the UNK had a very different interpretation of democracy , which will be discussed later , and their judgment never told them that the big three should UNK in establishing democratic conditions , as we understand them , within their UNK of influence STOP
START professor UNK UNK that at yalta , UNK did not fully realize the dilemma which faced him , that he thought the UNK of the UNK UNK from east european elections would not be greatly UNK by his allies , while neither roosevelt nor UNK UNK faced `` the fact that , in poland at least , UNK free democratic elections would return governments UNK to russia '' , by any definition of international UNK STOP
START also UNK propaganda and cooperation had `` UNK the differences between russian and western ideas of democracy '' , and it seemed better to have them covered by verbal UNK than to UNK the military UNK over germany and japan STOP
START the application of these UNK could not please both sides , for they really attempted to UNK the impossible to the inevitable STOP
START while obliged to UNK governments in east europe UNK with the soviet union instead of opposed to it , we thought we had preserved our social and economic system in east europe STOP
START this illusion was described in a UNK editorial in the new york UNK UNK , on march 5 , 1947 , in connection with the UNK of the UNK peace UNK to the senate STOP
START in doing so marshall and UNK were `` asking for the UNK of a UNK lesson in the facts of international life '' STOP
START we had UNK UNK ideas about our victory automatically establishing our system throughout the world STOP
START `` we were troubled about the fate of the UNK states STOP
START yalta left us with UNK UNK of a western UNK political economy UNK supreme up to the UNK line and the UNK of UNK '' ( UNK added ) STOP
START STOP
START this is a UNK description of our UNK illusion , which applied to other areas than east europe STOP
START the same editorial continued that `` we expected to UNK japan and UNK and to see a new china pattern itself easily on our institutions STOP
START we expected , in short , that most of the world would make itself over in our image and that it would be relatively simple , from such a position , to deal with the UNK UNK of the soviet union '' STOP
START yet actually `` the image UNK in no way to the UNK of the UNK world STOP
START neither our military , our economic nor our ideological power reached far enough '' to determine the fate of east europe STOP
START then the editorial added UNK : `` how far they may reach in asia is yet UNK , but they fall far short of our dreams of the war conferences '' STOP
START here is the best short explanation of the UNK of the cold war that has been written STOP
START UNK to UNK the lesson so clearly contained in the UNK UNK , president UNK UNK the cold war on march 12 , 1947 , in the UNK doctrine , exactly one week after the UNK UNK editorial was written , and a year after the cold war had been announced by UNK at UNK , missouri , in UNK presence STOP
START then china promptly went communist , and UNK had to fight the UNK UNK war for the UNK of UNK before we learned how far our UNK did `` reach in asia '' STOP
START years of war , strain , and UNK ; ; STOP
START of heavy arms expenditures and constant danger of another world war had to UNK before the united states could bring itself to accept the two chief results of world war 2 , -- communist control of east europe and china -- a new balance of power STOP
START while the cold war UNK it was easy to UNK it all on yalta STOP
START yet , in UNK a series of careful UNK on the yalta conference , UNK UNK could find no basis for yalta becoming `` a symbol for UNK and a UNK for the UNK of roosevelt and international cooperation '' STOP
START when the yalta papers were finally published with great UNK they had revealed no UNK by anyone STOP
START an analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts STOP
START first is the long and still somewhat UNK process of preparation , planning and discussion STOP
START preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to UNK rural UNK STOP
START all political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent UNK of a popular judgment led to some UNK STOP
START the second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , UNK and voting STOP
START considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above UNK STOP
START however , the UNK UNK results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing UNK under even the most favorable circumstances STOP
START a third aspect , and probably the one open to most controversy , is the results of the election STOP
START the electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party UNK , but all UNK interested parties , including the government itself , were UNK engaged in determining the party UNK of all successful candidates the month following the elections STOP
START the fourth and UNK point will be to estimate the UNK significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics STOP
START elections have UNK UNK in nearly every government program and official address since independence STOP
START they were stressed in the speeches of UNK UNK UNK when the first council of UNK was formed and again when the UNK took a leading role in the second council STOP
START king UNK 5 , was known to be most sympathetic to the formation of local UNK and made the first firm promise of elections on may day , 1957 STOP
START there followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the UNK of elections for the fall of 1957 , in which it appears that the minister of the interior took the most UNK view and that the UNK was something less than enthusiastic STOP
START since the complicated process of establishing new UNK and UNK the UNK plan left by the french did not even begin until the fall of 1957 , this goal appears somewhat UNK STOP
START from the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in UNK politics , precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to UNK in the new government STOP
START until the UNK of UNK was issued in the fall of 1958 , there were no UNK of the right to UNK or to UNK for political purposes STOP
START the UNK was still firmly united in 1957 , but the UNK UNK UNK de UNK ) , the most important minor party at the time , UNK to the UNK UNK in the civil service and influence in radio UNK STOP
START there were UNK that the ministry of the interior UNK an arbitrary , `` UNK '' process , which were indirectly UNK when the king personally UNK in the planned meetings STOP
START the day following his intervention the palace issued a statement UNK the citizens that `` the possibility of UNK UNK concerning the establishment of electoral lists , lists of candidates and finally the holding of the UNK itself '' would be supported by the king himself STOP
START the UNK crisis in the fall of 1957 UNK further consideration of elections , but french UNK were called in and UNK of further investigation appeared from time to time STOP
START in january , 1958 , the minister of the interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the king , the UNK of election dates appeared once again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer STOP
START although the government was probably prepared for elections by UNK , the first decision was no doubt made more difficult as party UNK UNK STOP
START in late 1957 the UNK UNK UNK ) appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal UNK of the UNK was revealed when the third council of government under UNK was formed without support from progressive elements in the party STOP
START the parties were on the whole UNK for elections , while the people were still UNK UNK UNK and suffering the UNK of poor UNK in 1957 STOP
START despite the internal and international crises that UNK UNK the elections remained a central issue STOP
START they UNK UNK in the UNK government of may , 1958 , which the king was UNK determined to keep in office until elections could be held STOP
START but the UNK sought `` UNK '' of the UNK council of government was never achieved as the UNK UNK over foreign policy , labor politics and economic development STOP
START by december , 1958 , when ' UNK UNK became president of the council , elections had even greater importance STOP
START they were increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing the new rural UNK as the focus of a new , UNK national effort STOP
START to minimize the UNK of UNK the UNK UNK the UNK government was formed STOP
START a UNK personnel and a special office was created in the ministry of the interior to plan and to conduct the elections STOP
START by this time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete STOP
START there remained only the UNK task of UNK the laws through the UNK of palace politics and making a small number of policy decisions STOP
START from the rather UNK history of electoral planning in UNK an important point UNK concerning the first elections in a developing country and UNK their results STOP
START in the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of UNK fundamental , and sometimes bitter , differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance STOP
START in the absence of a UNK of political UNK each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new UNK , but in a system where there is as yet no place for the less prominent STOP
START lacking the UNK and effective institutions that UNK helps provide , minority parties , such as the UNK 1957 and the progressive UNK UNK in 1958 , UNK for elections when out of power , but are not at all certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power STOP
START those in power tend to UNK and even to UNK the electoral process STOP
START the tendency to treat elections as an instrument of UNK rather than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in UNK STOP
START at the central level the UNK UNK voting system was selected over some form of the UNK de UNK system , even though the latter had been recommended by UNK and UNK by all political parties STOP
START the choice of the single member district was UNK to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country , but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections STOP
START although the elections were for local officials , it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly UNK their candidates STOP
START with multiple member districts the still UNK local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly STOP
START both parties and the ministry of the interior were UNK at work after the elections trying to UNK the political UNK of the successful candidates and , thereby , give the elections a UNK but known degree of national political significance STOP
START since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to UNK party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation STOP
START the general setting of the UNK election may also encourage the UNK of local party organization STOP
START the concentration of effective power in UNK leads not only to party UNK , but to UNK from local activity that might have had many UNK benefits in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections STOP
START interesting evidence can be found in the results of the chamber of commerce elections , which took place three weeks before national elections STOP
START the UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK , UNK et UNK ) was opposed by candidates of the new UNK UNK national UNK forces UNK ) in nearly all urban centers STOP
START as the more conservative group with strong UNK from UNK UNK , the UNK generally UNK against the more progressive , UNK UNK STOP
START the newer party UNK heavily , while the older , more UNK party expected the UNK merchants and small UNK to support them as they had done for many years STOP
START the local UNK and UNK did not campaign and lost heavily STOP
START the value of the elections was lost , both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable UNK of commercial interest , as shown in table 1 STOP
START the chamber of commerce elections were , of course , an important event in the preparation for rural UNK elections STOP
START the UNK that its urban organization , which depends heavily on UNK , was most effective STOP
START the UNK found that the spontaneous UNK of the independence struggle was not easily UNK to the more concrete , precise problems of internal politics STOP
START the UNK effect was probably to UNK more party activity in the UNK elections than might have otherwise taken place STOP
START a second major point of this essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections STOP
START although a somewhat technical subject , it has important political implications as the above discussion of the voting system indicated STOP
START furthermore , the problems and solutions devised in the electoral experiences of the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative value and essential to UNK election results STOP
START the UNK UNK UNK of the elections was naturally an UNK and UNK procedure STOP
START as the background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed UNK that a government dominated by either party could fairly UNK elections STOP
START the UNK later the popular movement protected the UNK `` UNK position '' until the fall of UNK , and then the UNK used the same argument , which it had previously ignored , against the UNK of the UNK government STOP
START the UNK of the preparation had , of course , proceeded under the supervision of the ministry of the interior , whose officials are UNK from party activity and probably generally UNK in party politics STOP
START apart from some areas of UNK trouble , like UNK UNK , where UNK officials had been appointed , there is little evidence that local officials UNK in the electoral process STOP
START UNK , however , the administrative problem was more complex and the UNK prestige of office was very likely an UNK advantage STOP
START the king decided to remove UNK a week before elections and to institute a UNK council of government under his personal direction STOP
START although the UNK had frequently asserted that the elections were to be without party significance , his action was an UNK admission that party UNK were a factor STOP
START the new council was itself UNK of political meaning , which was most clearly revealed in the absence of any UNK and the presence of several UNK leaders STOP
START since the details of the elections were settled the change of government had no direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections , and may have been more important as an indication of royal UNK with the UNK STOP
START STOP
START voting preparations began in the fall of 1959 , although the actual UNK and planning for the rural UNK was completed in 1958 STOP
START there were three major administrative tasks : the UNK of electoral districts , the registration of UNK and the registration of candidates STOP
START UNK registration began in late november 1959 and continued until early january , 1960 STOP
START the government was most anxious that there be a respectable response STOP
START UNK UNK of the UNK in each UNK made the registration process into a kind of competition among UNK officials STOP
START a goal was fixed , as given in table 2 , and attention UNK on its UNK STOP
START the UNK to vote were kept very simple STOP
START both men and women of UNK years of age could register and vote upon UNK proof of residence and identification STOP
START there were liberal provisions for UNK where documents or records were lacking STOP
START the police were UNK along with certain categories of UNK citizens , UNK and those UNK for UNK activities STOP
START the registration figures given in table 2 must be interpreted with caution since the estimate for UNK UNK were made without the benefit of a reliable UNK STOP
START UNK older workers who have no UNK of UNK employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure UNK and UNK in an occupation with a future STOP
START some vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need UNK the facilities STOP
START current programs STOP
START the present federal program of vocational education began in UNK with the passage of the UNK act , which provided a continuing annual UNK of UNK million to support , on a matching basis , UNK programs of vocational education in agriculture , UNK , industrial skills and home economics STOP
START since UNK some UNK UNK and related acts have extended this federal program STOP
START the UNK act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual UNK to UNK million in addition to the UNK million under the smith act STOP
START the health UNK act of 1956 added UNK million for practical UNK training STOP
START the latest major change in this program was introduced by the national defense education act of 1958 , title 8 , of which amended the UNK act STOP
START annual UNK of UNK million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled UNK STOP
START the federal program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education programs in public schools STOP
START the initiative , administration and control remain primarily with the local school districts STOP
START even the states remain primarily in an UNK role , providing leadership and teacher training STOP
START federal assistance is limited to half of the total UNK , and the state or local districts must pay at least half STOP
START the state may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost , or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it STOP
START throughout the history of the program , state government expenditures in the UNK have usually UNK or UNK the federal expenditures , while local districts all together have spent more than either federal or state governments STOP
START today , federal funds account for only UNK of the nation's expenditures for vocational education STOP
START the greatest impact of the UNK principle has been in initially encouraging the UNK states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds STOP
START national defense considerations have been the major reason behind most federal training expenditures in recent decades STOP
START during world war 2 , about UNK million persons were UNK in courses organized under two special programs UNK by state and local school authorities : ( 1 ) vocational education for national defense , and ( 2 ) war production training STOP
START the total cost of the UNK program was UNK million STOP
START for the UNK , UNK , and national defense act of 1958 , the cumulative total of federal expenditures in UNK years was only about UNK million STOP
START no comparable measures are available of UNK and expenditures for private vocational education training STOP
START there are a great number and variety of private commercial schools , trade schools and technical schools STOP
START in addition , many large corporations operate their own formal training programs STOP
START a recent study indicated that UNK per cent of the nation's largest corporations conducted educational programs involving some class meetings and UNK STOP
START most skilled industrial workers , nevertheless , still acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions STOP
START the national manpower council of columbia university has estimated that three out of five skilled workers and one out of five UNK have not been UNK trained STOP
START there is little doubt that the students benefit from vocational education STOP
START UNK prefer to UNK youth with such training rather than those without , and most graduates of vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training STOP
START vocational UNK do not claim that school training alone makes skilled workers , but it provides the essential UNK for developing skills STOP
START in most states , trade and industrial training is provided in a minority of the high schools , usually located in the larger cities STOP
START in arkansas fewer than 6 per cent of the high schools offer trade and industrial courses STOP
START in illinois about 13 per cent of the schools have programs , and in pennsylvania 11 per cent STOP
START an important recent trend is the development of area vocational schools STOP
START for a number of years UNK , louisiana and several other states have been building UNK vocational education schools that serve nearby school districts in several counties STOP
START these schools are intended to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school districts STOP
START transportation may be provided from nearby school districts STOP
START courses are provided mainly for post high school day programs ; ; STOP
START but sometimes arrangements also are made for high school students to attend , and evening extension courses also may be conducted STOP
START the title 8 , program of the national defense education act of 1958 was a great UNK to this trend toward area schools STOP
START by 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states STOP
START they were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of UNK labor surplus and in 10 of the minor areas STOP
START an extension of this program into the other UNK areas should be undertaken STOP
START relation to new industry STOP
START some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to UNK new industry STOP
START the major training need of a new industrial plant is a short period of UNK training for a large number of UNK machine operators STOP
START a few key skilled workers experienced in the company's type of work usually must be brought in with the plant manager , or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere STOP
START a prospective industry also may be interested in the UNK advantages of training programs in the area to supply future skilled workers and provide UNK extension courses for its employees STOP
START the existence of a public school vocational training program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled STOP
START additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities , staff and program are in being STOP
START thus , besides the training provided to youth in school , the existence of the school program can have UNK benefits to industry which make it an UNK to industrial development efforts STOP
START few states make effective use of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of UNK new industry STOP
START the opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an UNK UNK flexible basis to UNK any local UNK training programs that may be quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant STOP
START local focus of programs STOP
START the major weakness of vocational training programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands STOP
START this weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas , for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country STOP
START planning of vocational education programs and courses is UNK to local UNK needs for trained workers STOP
START all the UNK for setting up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs , of UNK the growth of local jobs , and of UNK with local UNK on the types of courses and their content STOP
START furthermore , there is a UNK UNK on the part of those making local skill surveys STOP
START local jobs can be seen and counted , while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more UNK STOP
START while the UNK of labor has a program of UNK industry and occupational employment trends and UNK current outlook statements , there is little tangible evidence that these UNK have been used UNK in local curriculum planning STOP
START the UNK of education continues to stress local surveys rather than national surveys STOP
START this procedure is extremely UNK in UNK labor surplus areas with a long history of UNK employment STOP
START elaborate studies have been made in labor surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job UNK and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training programs for those skills STOP
START no effort is made in the same studies to present information on regional or national demand trends in these skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be trained STOP
START moreover , the current information on what types of training are needed and possible is too limited and UNK STOP
START there simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that are in demand and the types of training programs that are required or most suitable STOP
START much of the available information comes not from the federal government but from an exchange of experiences among states STOP
START proposals STOP
START state and local agencies in the vocational education field must be encouraged to UNK a wider outlook on future job opportunities STOP
START there is a need for an expanded federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education departments and local school boards in existing programs STOP
START a related question is whether UNK workers can be UNK to take the training provided STOP
START there is little evidence that existing public or private training programs have any great difficulty getting students to UNK in their programs , even though they must pay UNK , receive no UNK payments , and are not UNK a job STOP
START however , there always is some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire training STOP
START again , one major difficulty is the local focus STOP
START a training program in a UNK area may have few UNK unless there is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities UNK , and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely at jobs in the local community STOP
START if there is adequate information on job opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere , many more workers can be expected to respond STOP
START another problem is who will pay for the training STOP
START local school districts are hard pressed UNK and UNK about vocational training STOP
START programs usually are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business leaders demand it STOP
START even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry is in sight and UNK it STOP
START state governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational schools , but their focus is still on area job opportunities STOP
START only the federal government is likely to be able to take a UNK and UNK view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs STOP
START if only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education , it could be argued that the state should not have to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit UNK in other states STOP
START however , if federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as well as for jobs in the area of UNK UNK STOP
START such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other UNK STOP
START a further possibility is suggested by the example of the UNK and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward UNK college education : that is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate STOP
START this probably would require some support for UNK as well as for UNK , but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of UNK compensation or a youth UNK corps STOP
START a maximum of UNK per year per student would enable many to take training away from home STOP
START a program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor STOP
START instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas , the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training STOP
START such specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly growing industries , where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunities are located STOP
START this would UNK possibilities for part-time cooperative , UNK and extension training STOP
START personal financial assistance would enable more emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual STOP
START his UNK and UNK could be given more weight in selecting the proper training STOP
START but briefly , the UNK UNK must be examined for its UNK STOP
START then the fact that the lower channel line was UNK had further UNK significance STOP
START and then the application of the count rules to the width ( UNK ) of the UNK gives us an UNK estimate of the probable depth of the decline STOP
START the very idea of there being `` count rules '' implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of UNK activity and the extent of the UNK ( run up or run down ) movement STOP
START this UNK is what really `` sold '' point and figure STOP
START but there is no positive and consistently UNK relationship in the UNK sense STOP
START experience will show that only the UNK UNK apply , and in fine , these merely UNK upon a relationship between the UNK and UNK of events STOP
START after all , too much does not happen too suddenly , nor does very little take long STOP
START the advantages and UNK of these two types of UNK , bar UNK and point and figure UNK , remain the subject of fairly UNK litigation among their respective professional UNK , with both methods UNK in common , one UNK merit STOP
START they are both UNK methods STOP
START even if we strip their respective claims to the UNK minimum , the `` UNK '' still favor them both , for the trend in effect is always more likely to continue than to reverse STOP
START of course , many more things are UNK besides prices STOP
START the UNK have been methods of UNK prices , but now let us look at some of the other UNK that are UNK UNK , and which are looked to for their UNK abilities STOP
START the quest for methods STOP
START the search for UNK UNK is UNK STOP
START UNK have been worked up between the UNK of freight cars and the course of stock price STOP
START the theory behind this is , of course , UNK in character STOP
START as the number of reported freight car UNK increased , this was taken to indicate increased industrial activity , and consequently increased stock UNK , UNK UNK UNK , and UNK therefore increased stock market prices STOP
START we now know that things rarely ever work out in such UNK fashion , and that car UNK , while perhaps interesting enough , are nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn before stock prices turn STOP
START but the quest for such an index goes on UNK , with all manner of UNK and UNK UNK , ranging from the UNK UNK type virtually to the UNK UNK operator , all seeking UNK , UNK , daily -- and often UNK -- for the UNK index that will UNK the eternal secret : which way will the market move -- up or down ? ? STOP
START it UNK to mind the quest of UNK times for the fountain of youth , a quest heavily UNK in , during the days of wooden ships STOP
START just as heavily UNK are the UNK of UNK of modern men who carry on the quest for the UNK index STOP
START the quest offers UNK STOP
START much of this goes on in offices high up in wall UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP
START there sit men who make moving UNK of weekly volume , monthly UNK of UNK ratios , ratios of the number of advances to the number of UNK , ratios of an individual UNK performance to UNK market performance , ratios of rising price volume to falling price volume , odd-lot UNK , and what not STOP
START they are concerned with all things UNK in , UNK , bonds , UNK , coffee , UNK , cotton , UNK , UNK , etc STOP
START and along UNK west jackson UNK , la UNK street , and around the UNK UNK UNK there sit men who chart crop reports , who divide the number of reported UNK by the number of reported UNK , and the number of UNK by the amount of corn STOP
START they plot the open interest curves , UNK curves , and they even divide democratic UNK by republican UNK STOP
START all these things and UNK more enter into their UNK , and yet , the UNK index remains UNK STOP
START not , at any rate , in the UNK sense of the word STOP
START the markets are far too subtle , and the last word in these UNK will UNK never be written , for the UNK index is about as UNK as the fountain of youth STOP
START but whereas UNK men no longer pursue the fountain , they never abandoned their UNK of the UNK index STOP
START we mentioned odd-lot UNK a few paragraphs ago STOP
START in the stock market , the normal trading package is a hundred shares , just as UNK UNK is the standard grain contract package STOP
START a stock UNK for less than a hundred shares is UNK via a special odd-lot UNK on the floor of the exchange STOP
START this results in a separate record being made , UNK these UNK from the UNK volume of trading STOP
START according to the theory underlying odd-lot UNK , the UNK who UNK odd lots is most likely a small UNK , one who can't afford to trade round lots STOP
START or , to use the UNK UNK of one odd-lot index UNK , they represent a sampling of the least sophisticated UNK of traders STOP
START falling most easily UNK to an UNK market movement , for this rank of traders can least afford to lose , virtually anything the odd-lot traders do , UNK , is taken to UNK the `` wrong '' thing to do STOP
START figures reporting the volume of odd-lot purchases and odd-lot sales are released by the stock exchange and carried in the newspapers STOP
START odd-lot index observers then make UNK of the data according to their particular statistical UNK STOP
START they might , for example , plot it exactly as is , or they might make ten day moving UNK of it , or longer moving UNK , or they might simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases to odd-lot sales STOP
START the particular UNK is a matter of individual taste STOP
START the data is now interpreted in conjunction with a price chart , usually of a popular stock average STOP
START towards the end of an intermediate or major rise , while the top is forming on the price chart , it is frequently observed that the odd-lot buying increases sharply STOP
START this UNK the UNK that the formation in progress is quite likely to be a top STOP
START similarly , at the opposite end of the market cycle , towards the end of an intermediate or major decline , usually while the bottom is being formed on the price chart , it is characteristic that an increase is noticed in odd-lot selling again UNK the UNK that a bottom is becoming a greater UNK STOP
START thus , in the UNK , the odd-lot UNK is one who UNK at the UNK and UNK at the UNK , UNK occasional individual exceptions STOP
START while it had long been known in general , that `` the public is always wrong '' , the use of odd-lot UNK now puts the UNK on a statistical basis STOP
START one might well wonder why the `` public is always wrong '' and the question raised is about as UNK as the one concerned with the chicken and the egg STOP
START which came first ? ? STOP
START is it really that the `` public '' UNK at the UNK , and not that the market UNK out when the `` public '' UNK ? ? STOP
START and the UNK at UNK STOP
START does the `` public '' usually sell at UNK , or does the market usually bottom out when the `` public '' UNK ? ? STOP
START we have been using the word `` public '' in UNK marks , that is , in its UNK UNK with reference to the odd-lot index theory STOP
START obviously someone has to sell in order for someone to buy , and vice UNK STOP
START and while all concerned are members of the literal public , somewhat less than all concerned , although still a majority , form the UNK marked `` public '' STOP
START and the public UNK the `` public '' leaves the so-called `` sophisticated '' element -- the element on the other end of the `` UNK '' UNK STOP
START this element is often called `` strong hands '' STOP
START strong hands differ from `` weak hands '' in that their operations are the primary UNK STOP
START they UNK campaigns , so to speak , even if this UNK is UNK among them , and their UNK action only UNK organized STOP
START strong hands act ; ; STOP
START weak hands react STOP
START strong hands move first ; ; STOP
START weak hands ask , what is going on ? ? STOP
START when strong hands buy , they are able to buy more , and they do it even in the face of UNK news reports STOP
START they are able to sit more UNK with what they have bought STOP
START UNK to say , strong hands are not eager to be joined by weak hands , for this increases the risk that they will have to UNK what these weak hands UNK on the way up , at higher prices , during the UNK phase of the campaign STOP
START certain badly UNK market critics are often apt to feel that there is something somehow UNK , UNK , or even thoroughly criminal about this UNK of competitive forces STOP
START but after all , can anyone imagine a market UNK the reverse of these things were true ? ? STOP
START try to imagine a market in which only a minority of traders would lose , and the majority would make consistent profits STOP
START how much and how many profits could a majority take out of the losses of a few ? ? STOP
START moreover , the UNK concerning the `` sophisticated '' UNK and its UNK UNK is put to test during every campaign , and UNK only upon results ; ; STOP
START not before STOP
START it quite often happens that campaigns go UNK , resulting in a most UNK UNK of strong hands into UNK hands , just as a member of a former UNK `` public '' may emerge UNK `` right '' the next time STOP
START membership in the UNK UNK too STOP
START the study of odd-lot UNK is somehow UNK to the UNK of a man trying to UNK his own UNK , what with all observers trying to get on the side of the `` few '' at the same time STOP
START the UNK of this study and of UNK analysis as well , UNK in direct proportion to the UNK of its use STOP
START it has to , by virtue of the very dictionary definition of the word `` few '' STOP
START UNK opposition must UNK as to the future course of prices , if there is to UNK a market at all STOP
START and the few must win what the many lose , for the opposite arrangement would not support markets as we know them at all , and is , in fact , UNK STOP
START there need be no UNK about UNK this STOP
START anyone still UNK that this is the only way markets can be is invited to try to imagine a market UNK the majority consistently UNK what the minority UNK STOP
START UNK UNK , whose work has been discussed in this chapter , was quoted in a new UNK magazine profile as saying : `` of course , you have to remember it's a good thing for us UNK that there aren't more of us STOP
START if you got too many people UNK by this method , their operations would begin to affect stock prices , and thus throw the UNK off STOP
START the method would become UNK '' STOP
START UNK UNK study helps in point and figure technique tells the readers : `` we assure you that the total number of people using this method of market analysis is a very small portion of the sum total of those operating in the UNK and commodities markets '' STOP
START what with traders trading for so many different objectives , and what with there being so many unique and UNK market theories and trading techniques in use , and more coming into use all the time , it is hard to imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough `` UNK '' to UNK itself STOP
START nevertheless , all theories and techniques lead but to one of two possible UNK of expression , if they lead to a market UNK at all STOP
START in the final analysis , then , the UNK becomes either a UNK or a bear in a given instance , UNK any amount of UNK and calculation , however elaborate STOP
START thus while his theory or technique may not be UNK , it is commonplace for UNK and UNK positions to become temporarily UNK STOP
START though the methods of UNK may be profound and diverse , the possible conclusions remain but two STOP
START chapter 6 , more methods STOP
START the UNK STOP
START the purpose set forth at the beginning of this book was first to UNK the reader to a general background knowledge of the various types and capabilities of the UNK methods already in use , so that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself the validity of the rather UNK empirical correlation that is to follow , and to UNK the UNK that its interpretation suggests for the future of farm prices over the years immediately ahead STOP
START in UNK the outlook for interest rates in 1961 , the question , as always , is the prospect for general business activity STOP
START by and large , what happens to business as a whole will UNK the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates STOP
START moreover , the trend of general business activity in 1961 will UNK a decisive influence on fiscal , UNK , and other federal policies which affect interest rates STOP
START UNK has been a UNK year for UNK of general business activity STOP
START during much of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a UNK UNK , but there have been persistent signs of UNK in the economy STOP
START the tendency for general business activity to UNK somewhat is becoming more evident STOP
START although the UNK in the advance of general business activity this year has thus far been quite UNK , it is hard to escape the conclusion that the UNK process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 and possibly somewhat longer STOP
START it is difficult to see any powerful sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the economy a new upward UNK STOP
START the rate of plant and equipment spending by business and industry now seems to be UNK out and facing some decline STOP
START in earlier business UNK , when this occurred the country usually experienced a sharp UNK in residential construction as mortgage financing became easier to obtain STOP
START at this time , however , there are signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with the usual speed to UNK a sharp rise in residential construction STOP
START these signs are the inventories of UNK houses in some areas of the country and the moderate rise in UNK rates for UNK ( UNK in september ) STOP
START on the other hand , in a more favorable vein , general business activity should receive some stimulus from rising federal spending , and the reduction in business inventories has probably run a good part of its course STOP
START the UNK increase in retail sales in october to a UNK high is encouraging in this connection as well as the most recent consumer survey by the national industrial conference board , which shows a decided UNK in consumer spending plans STOP
START the pattern of general business activity which probably lies ahead of us is a further moderate UNK through the spring of 1961 before a new rise in economic activity gets under way STOP
START the recovery will probably be UNK by a rising rate of housing starts next spring in response to more readily available mortgage credit , as well as by an expansion of government spending , well sustained consumer spending , and some UNK of business inventories STOP
START slight downward pressure STOP
START what does the general business outlook suggest about the trend of long-term rates in 1961 ? ? STOP
START it suggests that during the next several months , through the spring of 1961 , the demand for long-term capital funds may be UNK lower and that interest rates may tend to move a little lower , especially the rates on federal , state , and local bonds , as well as those on publicly offered corporate bonds STOP
START however , as UNK by the large corporate bond calendar at present , as well as the record amount of municipal bond issues approved by UNK , the over-all demands for capital funds seem likely to remain high , so that any downward pressure on rates from reduced demand should not be great STOP
START it seems likely , moreover , that with an increase in the rate of saving in mortgage UNK institutions , interest rates on residential UNK may move somewhat lower through the spring of next year , although the increased ease in residential mortgage UNK may occur primarily in other terms than interest rate , e.g, easier UNK and UNK terms STOP
START if the trend of general business activity follows the pattern suggested here , we are likely to see additional steps by the federal reserve authorities to ease the availability of credit STOP
START certainly a further reduction in the discount rate would be a strong possibility , as well as an easier reserve position for the UNK system STOP
START however , the UNK authorities will continue to be required to pay attention to the consequences of their actions with respect to our international balance of payments position and the UNK of gold , as well as with regard to UNK the creation of excessive UNK in the economy , which would delay the effectiveness of UNK policy measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle STOP
START open market policy STOP
START one of the most UNK questions is whether the recent UNK of the federal reserve authorities from UNK their open market operations to treasury bills will spread into UNK government UNK in the next few months STOP
START to the extent that the new administration has its wishes , the federal reserve would conduct its open market operations throughout the entire maturity range of government UNK and UNK seek to force down long-term interest rates STOP
START the principle of `` bills only '' , or `` bills preferably '' , seems so strongly accepted by the federal reserve that it is difficult to UNK conditions which would UNK the authorities to UNK UNK from it by extending their open market purchases regularly into long-term government UNK STOP
START however , to the extent that the UNK authorities , in their effort to ease credit in the next several months , conduct their open market operations in UNK government bonds , they will certainly act to UNK any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a result of market forces STOP
START by the end of the spring of 1961 , assuming that a general business recovery gets under way , interest rates should begin to edge upward again , depending upon the UNK of the recovery and the determination with which the UNK authorities move to UNK credit availability STOP
START my UNK would be that interest rates will decline UNK into the spring of 1961 and during the second half of the year will turn up gradually to UNK the ground lost during the UNK STOP
START it is pertinent to ask the question : has the long UNK of interest rates during the past 15 years just about run its course , and are we now entering a period in which both capital market forces and federal policies will produce a prolonged decline of interest rates ? ? STOP
START my answer is in the negative because i believe that total capital demands during the sixties will continue to press against available supplies , and interest rates will generally tend to be firm at high levels STOP
START five basic forces STOP
START this view is based upon several basic economic forces which i believe will be operating in the sixties , as follows : ( 1 ) STOP
START recent events in the general assembly of the united nations confirm that the cold war will remain with us , and probably UNK , for the UNK future STOP
START this makes it certain that federal expenditures for military UNK and foreign economic aid are likely to rise further in the next several years STOP
START we are just beginning the task of trying to win or maintain the friendship of the new african nations against the UNK competition of the communist UNK STOP
START our efforts to overcome the lead of the russians in space are bound to mean UNK federal spending STOP
START moreover , it is likely that federal policies aimed at UNK a UNK rate of economic growth of the country , to keep ahead of the communist countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better than theirs , will lead to rising federal spending in certain areas such as education , housing , medical aid , and the like STOP
START there are serious UNK involved in this trend toward rising federal expenditures , of which i take a UNK view , but it seems very likely to occur STOP
START ( 2 ) STOP
START during the sixties we have the prospect of a significant UNK up in the rate of household UNK , which should contribute to a rising volume of consumer expenditures and home building STOP
START according to the latest UNK of the bureau of the UNK , the annual rate of household UNK will increase for the next 20 years STOP
START under the most favorable assumptions for increase , the bureau of the UNK projects that the annual rate of household UNK will rise from about UNK in the last two years of the UNK to an annual rate of about UNK in the first five years of the sixties , and to a slightly higher annual rate of UNK in the second half of the decade STOP
START during the UNK the UNK show a more UNK rise to an annual rate of UNK in the second half of that decade STOP
START accordingly , the expanding markets for consumer goods and housing UNK by the higher rate of household formation should UNK the general economic prospects of the sixties STOP
START however , the impact of a rising rate of household formation this decade should not be UNK STOP
START the average annual rate of UNK in the second half of the sixties is still considerably below the annual rate of UNK in the UNK period from april 1947 to march 1950 STOP
START ( 3 ) STOP
START with the expansion of family formation in the sixties , a continued substantial rise in expenditures by state and local government units seems to be indicated STOP
START this is an area in which there is still a large UNK of demand STOP
START state and local expenditures ( in real terms ) increased UNK from UNK in 1949 to UNK in 1959 , and it would not be surprising if they showed a comparable increase in this decade , which would carry them to the neighborhood of UNK by UNK STOP
START here would be a powerful force for raising business activity STOP
START ( 4 ) STOP
START it seems likely that with the three preceding forces at play , the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditures should continue to move upward from the levels of the UNK STOP
START UNK by UNK competition in our industrial system , and still further increases in the funds devoted to industrial research , plant and equipment expenditures by business and industry should rise during the decade STOP
START ( 5 ) STOP
START in a more UNK vein about the economic outlook , i suspect that the UNK of demand for consumer goods and housing which was UNK during the UNK and world war 2 , is finally in the process of running dry STOP
START there is some UNK evidence of this STOP
START for example , the huge postwar demand on the part of UNK for housing under the UNK home loan UNK program seems to have largely UNK itself STOP
START indeed , the failure of UNK as a whole to respond this year to somewhat greater availability of mortgage financing , and the increasing reports of UNK of UNK homes and rising UNK rates in apartment buildings , may also signal in part that the UNK days of big UNK demand for housing are reaching an end STOP
START in a way , we may be UNK the same thing in the sales of automobiles today as the public no longer is willing to purchase any car coming on the market but is more UNK on UNK cars free of the UNK which were accepted in the UNK STOP
START the huge UNK of demand which was evident in the first decade and a half after the war was fed by liquid UNK UNK by the public during the war , and even more so by the easier and easier credit in the consumer loan and home loan fields STOP
START the UNK public has used up a good part of these liquid UNK , or they have been UNK by the rising price level , and we have apparently UNK to the end of the line in making consumer or home mortgage terms easier STOP
START this is not to say that the level of consumer expenditures will not continue to rise in the sixties STOP
START i am UNK that it will , but consumer spending in the sixties will not be UNK by the great UNK of wants and desires which characterized most of the UNK STOP
START markets should become more competitive as UNK become more selective STOP
START UNK capital requirements STOP
START accordingly , during the sixties our national economy is likely to grow at as fast a rate as in the UNK and , in the process , to require enormous amounts of capital funds STOP
START UNK policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces -- no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases STOP
START the purpose of this paper is to UNK one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to UNK the UNK behavior of a few very important industries STOP
START while there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of UNK to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the united states since world war 2 STOP
START indeed , the apparent UNK of the industry's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented STOP
START the model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition , but which is so basic that its UNK policies are held in check by continuous critical public UNK STOP
START where the industry's product price has been kept below the `` UNK '' and `` UNK '' prices due to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands STOP
START the contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications STOP
START in order to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` UNK UNK '' on `` key '' wage UNK , we deliberately UNK the model by UNK from other forces , such as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation STOP
START for UNK purposes , this is best treated as a model which UNK out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages STOP
START part 1 , below describes this abstract model by UNK out its assumptions STOP
START part 2 , UNK the operation of the model and UNK some significant conclusions STOP
START part 3 , UNK the empirical UNK and policy implications of the conclusions STOP
START part 4 , is a brief summary STOP
START the mathematical UNK presents the UNK argument , but is best read after part 1 , in order that the assumptions underlying the UNK may be explicit STOP
START 1 , the assumptions of the model STOP
START a STOP
START the industry STOP
START the industry with which this model is concerned is a basic industry , producing a substantial share of gross national product STOP
START price competition is lacking STOP
START for the purposes of setting the product price , the industry UNK as a single UNK STOP
START in wage UNK , the industry UNK as a unit with a single union STOP
START b STOP
START the demand for the industry's product STOP
START we are concerned with UNK demand for the industry's product STOP
START the manner in which this is shared among firms is taken as given STOP
START in any given time period , the UNK demand for the industry's product is determined by two things : the price charged by the industry , and the level of aj STOP
START for the purposes of this discussion , the problem of relative prices is UNK in these two variables , since UNK includes other prices STOP
START ( we abstract here from technological progress and assume that prices of all other products change UNK STOP
START ) STOP
START the form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary UNK with the product price , and vary directly with the level of aj STOP
START c STOP
START industry product price policy STOP
START the industry of this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest STOP
START because of its importance , and because the lack of price competition is well recognized , the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases STOP
START the threat of effective UNK action , UNK by `` UNK the public '' through price increases not justified by cost increases , and fears of UNK relations with customers , congress , the general public and the press , all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases STOP
START for the industry of this model , the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the UNK UNK price ( given the wage rate and the level of UNK ) , and even below the UNK price ( but not below average cost ) STOP
START for such an industry , it is only `` safe '' to raise its price if such an increase is UNK `` justified '' by rising costs ( due to rising wages , UNK STOP
START thus , if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge , this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate STOP
START in this model , we abstract from all UNK sources of cost changes , so that the `` UNK price '' only rises as the wage rate rises STOP
START in such circumstances , it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate STOP
START since marginal costs rise when the wage rate rises , the UNK price also rises when the UNK price is UNK , and is likely to remain well above the latter STOP
START the UNK price will also be raised for potential domestic competition , but unless general UNK permits profit UNK to increase UNK throughout the economy , we might expect the UNK price to approach the UNK price STOP
START the UNK price would be approached more rapidly , since domestic UNK do not enter foreign costs directly STOP
START where this approach becomes critical , the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its UNK in `` UNK '' the wage pressures of a powerful union , UNK UNK relief after it has `` UNK '' UNK to the union pressure STOP
START whether or not it is in the industry's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends upon the extent to which the UNK price rises in response to a basic wage increase , and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase STOP
START the extent to which the UNK price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things : the passage of time , the level of UNK , and the size of the wage increase STOP
START we are UNK from the fact of strikes here , but it should be obvious that the extent to which the UNK price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the industry STOP
START the industry may deliberately take a strike , not to put pressure on the union , but in order to `` UNK '' the government and the customers of the industry STOP
START as a strike continues , these parties increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement STOP
START they become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage UNK would UNK STOP
START public UNK and resistance to UNK increases is obviously much less when the increases are on the order of UNK per UNK than when the increases are on the order of UNK per month STOP
START the simple passage of an additional eleven UNK time makes the second UNK UNK more acceptable STOP
START thus , the UNK price is raised further by a given wage increase the longer it has been since the previous price increase STOP
START notice , however , that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices per UNK , without an accompanying wage increase STOP
START similarly , higher levels of UNK do not , in themselves , provide grounds for raising prices , but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase STOP
START this is not extended to UNK levels of UNK , however -- only the current level of UNK affects the public pressure against UNK increases STOP
START finally , since the public requires some UNK on the part of the companies , larger wage increases call for less than UNK larger price increases ( e.g, if a wage increase of UNK allows a price increase of UNK , a wage increase of UNK allows a price increase of something less than UNK ) STOP
START d STOP
START industry costs STOP
START we assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation is constant with respect to quantity produced ( the average cost curve is UNK , and therefore is identical with the marginal cost curve ) , and is the same for every firm ( and therefore for the industry ) STOP
START the level of this average cost is determined by factor prices , technology , and so forth STOP
START as we have noted , however , we are UNK from changes in all UNK of this level except for changes in the wage rate STOP
START the level of average cost ( equal to marginal cost ) is thus strictly a function of the wage rate STOP
START e STOP
START union policies and collective UNK issues STOP
START the single union which faces the industry does not UNK its membership , and there is an adequate supply of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate STOP
START the union does not regard UNK of its own members as a matter of concern when setting its own wage policy -- its concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment STOP
START the union UNK demands wage increases from productivity increases , and wage increases to UNK UNK increases , but we abstract from these forces here STOP
START for our present purposes we assume that the UNK subject of UNK is the basic wage rate ( not including productivity improvement factors or UNK adjustments ) , and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs STOP
START productivity is something of an UNK concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even well known to the industry , much less to the union or to the public STOP
START UNK on the amount of productivity increase UNK the problem of UNK how an increase in profit UNK related to a productivity increase should be shared STOP
START the existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not UNK the assumption that the union is willing to settle for UNK and UNK increases as distinct from a UNK increase in the basic wage rate STOP
START we assume further that the union UNK the possibility that UNK increases may UNK UNK increases , and it does not entirely UNK the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the `` real '' wage rate STOP
START for internal political reasons , the union UNK for ( and UNK ) increases in the basic wage rate , and would UNK UNK a reduction in this rate , but the adjustment of the basic wage rate UNK is essentially up to the discretion of the companies of the industry STOP
START changes in the basic wage rate are UNK , and they constitute an argument for raising prices STOP
START however , it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate , although the companies are UNK to have reliable estimates of this magnitude STOP
START in this model , then , the industry is UNK to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may , in circumstances to be UNK out in part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise STOP
START thus , for UNK changes in the basic wage rate , the industry becomes the active UNK , since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry UNK STOP
START the UNK in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be UNK in this case , on the grounds that it is `` clearly '' not in the interest of the industry to raise wages UNK STOP
START from this UNK it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model STOP
START it is this conclusion that we challenge ; ; STOP
START we do so by UNK the UNK on which it is based STOP
START 2 , the operation of the model STOP
START it is convenient to assume that the UNK contract is of one year's UNK STOP
START in the century from UNK to UNK the law of nations became international law STOP
START several factors contributed to this change STOP
START the congress of UNK is a convenient starting point because it both UNK and UNK what was to follow STOP
START here in UNK the great nations assembled to UNK not merely for europe , but for the world STOP
START thus the congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century STOP
START international law had to fit the conditions of europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great european nations UNK , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense STOP
START essentially this imposed two conditions : first , international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive , UNK , and UNK in their political UNK with one another ; ; STOP
START second , it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared STOP
START in both respects , international law was UNK STOP
START it was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions STOP
START on the one hand , the major european nations had to maintain UNK each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal UNK -- thus UNK for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of UNK '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a UNK of the UNK UNK experience STOP
START but there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world STOP
START thus , theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller european states did not really UNK fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere STOP
START political interference in africa and asia and even in latin america ( though limited in latin america by the special interest of the united states as expressed in the UNK doctrine , itself from the UNK related to european politics and long dependent upon the `` balance of power '' system in europe ) was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values and the european `` balance '' itself STOP
START a nation such as UNK could be UNK by agreement and could be UNK upon to protect its UNK ; ; STOP
START more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the north ) was the UNK of the latin american countries ; ; STOP
START out of the question was the UNK of asia and africa STOP
START this UNK of the law was made explicit by a number of UNK century scholars STOP
START more emphasis was put upon the fact that international law was the law of `` UNK nations '' ; ; STOP
START UNK and story , the great early american scholars , repeatedly made use of this phrase , or of `` christian nations '' , which is a substantial equivalent STOP
START UNK stated that the public law was essentially `` limited to the UNK and christian peoples of europe or to those of european origin '' STOP
START of course it had always been of european origin in fact , but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural law theory STOP
START now , with virtually every writer , not only was the european origin of public law UNK as a historical phenomenon , but the rules thus established by the advanced UNK of europe were to be imposed on others STOP
START the european customs on which international law was based were to become , by force and UNK , the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states STOP
START hall , for example , was quite explicit on this point when he said states outside european civilization must UNK enter into the circle of UNK countries STOP
START they must do something with the UNK of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its UNK beyond all possibility of UNK '' STOP
START during the nineteenth century these views were UNK by virtually all the latin american writers , though UNK , just as the new nations of africa and asia protest them , with more effect , today STOP
START a number of other nineteenth-century developments contributed to the UNK of the law of nations into international law ; ; STOP
START that is , from aspects of a universal system of justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states STOP
START the difference is important , for although the older law of nations did cover relationships among UNK , this was by no means its exclusive UNK STOP
START the law of nature governed UNK in their relationship to their own citizens , to UNK , and to each other in a UNK UNK system STOP
START the theory of international law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in europe and america , broke this unity and this UNK STOP
START it lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules UNK the exercise of state power for reasons essentially UNK with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations STOP
START no longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine what he ought to do ; ; STOP
START his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action STOP
START to appreciate this development , we must UNK it to other aspects of nineteenth-century philosophy STOP
START first , and most obvious , was the growing nationalism and the tendency to regard the state , and the individual's identification with the state , as UNK other ties of social UNK STOP
START national identification was not new , but it was UNK in intensity and scope throughout europe as new UNK occurred STOP
START it reached its ultimate philosophical statement in notions of `` state will '' put forward by the germans , especially by UNK , although political UNK will recognize its UNK in the rejected UNK of UNK STOP
START national identification was reflected UNK in law theories which incorporated this UNK abstraction and saw law , domestic and international , simply as its formal reflection STOP
START in the international community this reduced law to UNK UNK STOP
START a state , the highest form of human organization in fact and theory , could be subjected to law only by a UNK of UNK , or consent STOP
START according to the new theories , the nineteenth century corporate sovereign was `` sovereign '' in a quite new and different sense from his historical UNK STOP
START he no longer sought to find the law ; ; STOP
START he made it ; ; STOP
START he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be STOP
START there was no law , domestic or international , except that UNK by , UNK by , or UNK to by states STOP
START UNK behind UNK UNK were more practical reasons for a changing UNK STOP
START related to , but UNK from , nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another STOP
START increased participation in politics and the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions STOP
START the efforts of various interest groups to control or influence governmental decisions , particularly when taken in conjunction with the impact of UNK , led to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby policy could be formulated and enforced as law through UNK institutions STOP
START law became a conscious process , something more than simply doing justice and looking to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms STOP
START particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no longer satisfactory to many , when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were UNK STOP
START the old way of doing things , which UNK on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations , was no longer adequate to the task STOP
START first was the period of UNK of existing law : the code UNK in france and the peculiar UNK that , in fact , resulted from UNK UNK and ordering of the common law in england STOP
START UNK was followed in all countries by a growing amount of legislation , some changing and UNK the older law , much dealing with entirely new situations STOP
START the legislative mills have been UNK ever since , and when its UNK processes were no longer adequate to the task , a limited legislative authority was UNK in one form or another , to the executive STOP
START whereas the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice , the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law STOP
START indeed , with developed UNK , the separation of law from justice , or from morality generally , became quite specific STOP
START in municipal systems we tend to view what is called UNK as UNK a movement to UNK policy by increasing the power of parliament -- the elected representatives -- at the expense of the more conservative UNK STOP
START when the power of the latter was made both limited and explicit -- when norms were UNK and made more precise and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in UNK hands -- two purposes were served : government was made UNK to an UNK popular will , and law became a rational system for UNK that will , for serving conscious goals , for UNK the `` public policy '' STOP
START it is true that , initially , the task was to remove restrictions that , it was thought , UNK the free flow of money , goods , and labor ; ; STOP
START but even UNK was a conscious policy STOP
START law was seen as an UNK of the `` sovereign will '' STOP
START however , the sovereign was not UNK absolute UNK but rather the UNK sovereign of UNK STOP
START it was , too , an optimistic philosophy , and , though it separated law from morality , it was by no means an UNK or UNK one STOP
START man , through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom , was master of his destiny STOP
START the theory did not require , though it unfortunately might acquire , a UNK UNK STOP
START it was merely a UNK and ordering of new institutions of popular government STOP
START it was not opposed to either justice or morality ; ; STOP
START it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who UNK public authority STOP
START particularly was this true as UNK UNK became the dominant UNK of western society STOP
START to free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising UNK , and this objective required that governmental authority -- administrative officials and judges -- be limited as precisely and UNK as possible ; ; STOP
START that old customs which UNK trade be UNK ; ; STOP
START that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might UNK the automatic adjustments of the free market ; ; STOP
START that obligations of status that were UNK with the new politics and the new economics be done away with STOP
START contract -- conceived as the free UNK of formal UNK -- replaced the implied obligations of a more UNK and UNK society STOP
START indeed , contract was the dominant legal theme of the century , the UNK of the free society STOP
START government itself was based upon contract ; ; STOP
START business organization -- the corporation -- was analyzed in UNK terms ; ; STOP
START trade was based on freedom of contract , and money was UNK and UNK on UNK terms ; ; STOP
START even marriage and the family was seen as a UNK arrangement STOP
START it is not surprising that the international obligations of states were also viewed in terms of contract STOP
START in fact , some -- UNK is the principle example -- went so far as to say that all international law could be traced to the single legal UNK , UNK UNK UNK STOP
START the displacement ( at least to a considerable extent ) of the ethical UNK of the UNK and eighteenth centuries by UNK UNK both international law theory and doctrine STOP
START in the first place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law , UNK the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal system STOP
START one result was to UNK much that had been regarded as the law of nations STOP
START UNK law , the law merchant , and the host of problems which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country were all UNK from the older law of nations and made dependent on the several national laws STOP
START private international law ( which americans call the `` conflict of laws '' ) was thus segregated from international law proper , or , as it is often called , public international law STOP
START states were free to UNK , within broad , though ( perhaps ) UNK limits , their own rules as to the application of foreign law by their courts , to vary the law merchant , and to UNK legislation with regard to many claims arising on the high UNK STOP
START the change was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in fact common norms continued to be UNK by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation , and then largely in marginal situations STOP
START mrjustice black was one of the minority that UNK on the article 1 , power STOP
START in this view , supported by only three members of the court , a power denied by the specific provisions of article 3 , was granted by the UNK of article 1 STOP
START if this seems arbitrary , its effect was to treat citizens of the district of columbia equally with citizens of the states -- at the expense of expanding a UNK jurisdiction STOP
START federal question jurisdiction STOP
START for almost a hundred years we UNK upon state courts ( subject to review by the supreme court ) for the protection of most rights arising under national law STOP
START then in UNK , apparently in response to the UNK influence of the civil war , congress first gave the lower federal courts general authority -- UNK with state UNK -- to decide cases involving UNK questions STOP
START one purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights UNK by the civil war UNK against state interference STOP
START serious difficulty UNK with the UNK of UNK due process STOP
START an UNK , presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly UNK slaves , became a `` UNK '' UNK upon state economic policy STOP
START a flood of federal lower court UNK seriously UNK the processes of local government STOP
START congress UNK with a series of measures UNK in various ways what it had granted in UNK STOP
START in 1910 it required the UNK of a special UNK court for the UNK of certain UNK and allowed direct UNK to the supreme court STOP
START such legislation was UNK and extended from time to time thereafter STOP
START in UNK an UNK provision was made for the stay of federal UNK proceedings upon institution of state court test cases STOP
START the essential UNK of these measures resulted in UNK in substantial UNK of federal jurisdiction to UNK state public utility rate orders STOP
START three years later similar UNK were imposed upon UNK against collection of state taxes STOP
START this saved for state UNK , in the first instance , the two major areas where federal UNK had been most UNK , but other areas remained UNK STOP
START meanwhile , the supreme court , like congress , showed UNK concerning this aspect of government by UNK STOP
START drawing upon the traditional discretion of the UNK , mrjustice holmes introduced a series of UNK judicial UNK that UNK in mrjustice UNK famous doctrine of UNK STOP
START whereas the earlier cases turned rather UNK upon the availability of adequate state UNK , the new emphasis is upon the nature of the state policy at issue STOP
START the classic case is railroad commission UNK STOP
START the commission had issued an administrative order which was UNK as UNK against negroes STOP
START its enforcement was UNK by a federal trial court STOP
START on review the supreme court , via mrjustice frankfurter , found southern racial problems `` a sensitive area of social policy on which the federal courts ought not to enter unless no alternative to UNK is open '' STOP
START an alternative was found in the UNK of state law as to whether the UNK order had in fact been authorized STOP
START UNK , as usual , to UNK state legislation -- such interpretation can only be a `` UNK rather than a determination '' -- mrjustice frankfurter led a UNK court to UNK the UNK STOP
START but it is crucial that here , unlike UNK , the trial court was ordered to UNK the case until the state courts had had a reasonable opportunity to settle the UNK question STOP
START `` the resources of UNK are equal to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a UNK decision as well as the friction of a UNK constitutional UNK '' STOP
START temporary UNK , i.e, UNK , is one thing ; ; STOP
START refusal to UNK is another STOP
START to the extent that the UNK principle of UNK stands UNK by subsequent legislation , federal UNK relief against state action must be available -- or so it seems to mrjustice frankfurter STOP
START in alabama public service commission UNK UNK the commission had refused to permit UNK of certain `` UNK '' train facilities STOP
START the railroad , UNK UNK of property without due process of law , sought UNK relief STOP
START the court held that federal jurisdiction should not be exercised UNK the domestic policy of the state be UNK ; ; STOP
START this in the name of UNK discretion STOP
START UNK frankfurter and jackson UNK in the UNK result , for they found no merit in the UNK claim STOP
START but they UNK UNK to the proposition that federal courts may UNK to exercise jurisdiction UNK in a valid act of congress : STOP
START `` by one fell UNK the court now finds that congress UNK in UNK legislation in the acts of 1910 , UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK STOP
START by these measures , congress , so the court ( in effect ) now UNK , gave not only UNK but inadequate relief , since it now appears that the federal courts have inherent power to UNK the act of UNK against all proceedings UNK local regulation '' STOP
START a most UNK recent case is textile workers union UNK mills STOP
START the UNK act gave the federal courts jurisdiction over `` suits for violation of contracts between an UNK and a labor organization representing employees in an industry UNK commerce '' STOP
START on its face this merely provides a federal UNK ; ; STOP
START it does not establish any law ( rights ) for the federal judges to UNK STOP
START how can judges exercise jurisdiction to UNK national rights when congress has created none ? ? STOP
START the court held that congress had intended the federal UNK to `` fashion '' an appropriate law of UNK contracts STOP
START in short , UNK power to grant UNK authority to federal courts is now apparently so broad that congress need not create , or specify , the right to be enforced STOP
START the lincoln mills decision UNK a whole new body of federal `` common law '' which , as mrjustice frankfurter pointed out in UNK , leads to one of the following `` UNK '' : `` ( ( 1 ) conflict in federal and state court UNK of collective UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START ( 2 ) displacement of state law by federal law in state courts in all actions regarding collective UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START or ( 3 ) UNK of state court jurisdiction over these matters '' STOP
START the UNK elaborate examination of the legislative history of the provision in question suggests that UNK purpose was merely to make UNK UNK STOP
START with a few exceptions , the UNK seemed UNK of the technical problems of federal jurisdiction involved -- to say nothing of the UNK of UNK power to judges STOP
START to avoid these constitutional difficulties , mrjustice frankfurter was prepared to read the UNK provision as concerned with diversity , rather than federal question , jurisdiction STOP
START this would satisfy what presumably was UNK major purpose -- the UNK of UNK STOP
START it would also leave UNK the UNK traditional authority in the realm of contract law STOP
START ( as we have seen , the UNK and york decisions require federal courts in diversity cases to follow state UNK rules STOP
START ) here again mrjustice frankfurter could not lightly accept the principle of UNK judicial legislation STOP
START if congress wants to UNK the states from areas which they have UNK occupied , let it do so UNK and UNK STOP
START and let it do its own UNK and not leave that to federal judges STOP
START does lincoln mills suggest that if congress granted jurisdiction over UNK divorce cases , the federal courts would be authorized to fashion a national law for the UNK of marriages ? ? STOP
START there is a common problem behind most of these federal question and diversity cases STOP
START congress has not clearly defined the UNK between state and federal court competence STOP
START it has the power to do so but for the most part has left the matter for solution by judges on a UNK basis STOP
START a careful student has suggested that `` in any new UNK ( of the judicial code ) the UNK would do well to remember that the allocation of power to the federal courts should be limited to those matters in which their UNK in federal law might be used , leaving to the state UNK the primary obligation of UNK state law '' STOP
START obviously , the goal here proposed is the UNK principle in mrjustice UNK opinions -- to the extent that congress leaves the problem to judicial discretion STOP
START the same rule of UNK and division of labor UNK him in the UNK UNK cases , in the administrative law area , and indeed in the whole realm of judicial review STOP
START mrjustice black no doubt UNK in principle but is more apt to make exceptions to achieve a generous and `` just '' result STOP
START he will not be `` UNK by UNK '' STOP
START federal review of state decisions STOP
START with few exceptions , congress has not given federal courts exclusive authority to UNK rights arising under federal law STOP
START to put it UNK , state and federal courts have UNK jurisdiction with respect to most claims of federal right STOP
START to insure uniformity in the meaning of national law , however , state UNK are subject to supreme court review STOP
START it may be noted , UNK , that to UNK `` desegregation '' an UNK and former southern governor has urged congress to UNK this UNK authority STOP
START the result , of course , would be that federal law inevitably would mean different things in different states STOP
START it would also probably mean different things within the same state -- depending upon what court ( state or federal ) rendered decision STOP
START we consider here only a few of many problems involved in this crucial UNK relationship STOP
START the first is that enforcement of national law in state litigation raises in reverse the old diversity UNK of the relation of procedure to substance STOP
START subject to certain constitutional UNK in favor of fair trials , each level of government is free to UNK its own judicial procedures STOP
START UNK who choose to assert federal claims in a state court go into that court subject to its rules of procedure STOP
START a similar UNK applies to those who press state claims in federal UNK , e.g, in diversity cases STOP
START in an UNK controversy the state court followed established state procedure by UNK a vague UNK `` most strongly against '' the UNK STOP
START in other words the burden of UNK clearly UNK upon the UNK by state law STOP
START the result was that the UNK case was UNK STOP
START mrjustice black led a UNK majority : `` UNK local rules of UNK cannot be used to UNK UNK UNK upon rights of recovery authorized by federal law '' STOP
START here , as in the UNK case , another element of state procedure was UNK to federal UNK law STOP
START UNK frankfurter and jackson UNK : `` one state may UNK UNK more than another , one state may be more UNK than another to UNK UNK STOP
START if a UNK UNK to UNK a federal right in a state court , he cannot be heard to object if he is treated exactly as are UNK who press like claims arising under state law with regard to the form in which the claim must be stated -- the UNK , for instance , with which a cause of action must be described STOP
START federal law , though UNK in a state court , UNK the federal claim -- UNK what gives a right to recovery and what goes to prove it STOP
START but the form in which the claim must be stated need not be different from what the state UNK in the enforcement of like obligations created by it , so long as a requirement does not add to , or UNK , the right as defined by federal law , nor burden the realization of this right in the UNK of litigation '' STOP
START another problem in the area of UNK relationships is this : what UNK UNK error in a state decision ? ? STOP
START UNK UNK involved a conviction for UNK conduct under a local UNK STOP
START the conduct in question was a speech STOP
START the accused did not object to the trial UNK charge to the jury that UNK `` may constitute a UNK of the peace if it UNK the public to anger , UNK dispute , brings about a condition of UNK STOP
START '' for present purposes it may be assumed that this charge so UNK limited speech as to UNK the federal constitution STOP
START though the accused raised many other UNK , he did not object on this crucial point at any stage of the proceedings STOP
START that is , he did not claim in any of the four courts through which his case UNK that the jury charge had denied him any federal right STOP
START how else can one explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to UNK bond discount and UNK ( section UNK ) , but not the right to UNK bond issue expenses ; ; STOP
START or allowing a UNK for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section UNK ) , but not a UNK for UNK losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; STOP
START or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of UNK ( section UNK ) , but not allowing rapid UNK of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; STOP
START or allowing survival of a UNK carryover to a personal holding company ( section UNK ) , but not carryover of excess tax UNK for foreign taxes ? ? STOP
START these items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section UNK STOP
START there does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax UNK or in terms of UNK possibilities STOP
START with respect to items such as these the provisions of section UNK , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are UNK or UNK to the UNK corporation STOP
START to this extent some UNK of the literal meaning of the committee report seems justified , since the literal meaning UNK with the clear UNK , if not the language , of the statute STOP
START it is not contended that section UNK should UNK the survival of all of the UNK tax attributes STOP
START such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone ; ; STOP
START it would certainly UNK the intention of congress as expressed in the committee report ; ; STOP
START and in at least one instance , involving refund claims , it might be contrary to another provision of the united states code STOP
START refund claims STOP
START section UNK of the united states code UNK an assignment of a claim against the government unless made after it has been allowed , the amount due has been UNK , and a warrant for its payment has been issued STOP
START if it were not for judicial development of certain exceptions , this section would UNK a suit for refund by an UNK corporation for taxes paid by a transferor corporation , even though the reorganization meets the requirements of section UNK STOP
START a clearly recognized exception is a statutory UNK or UNK STOP
START the leading case , UNK air line UNK UNK states , held that the UNK could UNK for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor , and it has been consistently followed STOP
START the court said the purpose of the section was UNK to spare the government the UNK and trouble of dealing with several parties , one of them a UNK to the claim , and to prevent traffic in claims , particularly UNK claims , against the government STOP
START neither reason , said the court , applied to the case at hand ; ; STOP
START furthermore , congress could not be UNK to have intended to UNK UNK approved by the states STOP
START other exceptions are assignments for the benefit of UNK , corporate UNK , UNK by UNK , or UNK by UNK STOP
START exceptions are often classified as UNK by `` operation of law '' STOP
START a UNK reorganization not UNK with the UNK or UNK UNK of the states involved is difficult to fit into an `` operation of law '' mold STOP
START although it is in some ways comparable to a voluntary sale of UNK for cash , to which section UNK quite clearly applies , the courts and treasury have held that UNK corporations in several types of UNK UNK may UNK for refund of taxes paid by UNK STOP
START a recent case in point is UNK UNK UNK states , in which a claim against the government was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership , whose UNK were former stockholders , and then to another corporation formed by the UNK STOP
START holding the final corporation entitled to UNK on the claim , the court cited the UNK , UNK trading , and UNK cases for the proposition that `` UNK by operation of law or in conjunction with changes of corporate structure are not assignments UNK by the statute '' STOP
START in an earlier case , UNK & UNK states , an american corporation was formed for the purpose of UNK the stock of a british corporation in exchange for its own stock and then UNK the british corporation STOP
START the UNK statute was held not to prevent the american corporation from UNK for a refund of taxes paid by the british corporation STOP
START the UNK presumably would have qualified under section UNK as a UNK reorganization , followed by a section UNK UNK , but not under section UNK as a statutory UNK of UNK STOP
START the court , nevertheless , UNK on the UNK case and also mentioned that the UNK of the two corporations were the same STOP
START in substance , said the court , there was no transfer of UNK title STOP
START the treasury UNK at substantially the same conclusion , but UNK the problem of section UNK of the united states code STOP
START revenue ruling UNK provides that if the corporation against which a tax was UNK has since been UNK by UNK with a successor corporation , a claim for refund should be filed by the successor in the name and on behalf of the corporation which paid the tax , followed by the name of the successor corporation STOP
START proper evidence of the UNK and succession must also be filed STOP
START if the succession is a matter of public record , UNK of the UNK of state or other public officials having UNK of the documents will UNK ; ; STOP
START if the succession is not of record , all documents relating to such succession , properly UNK , are required STOP
START the former proof seems applicable to a statutory UNK or UNK , the latter to a UNK acquisition STOP
START the ruling would not , however , apply to an acquisition of UNK for cash STOP
START a recent ruling , although rather UNK , UNK and follows UNK STOP
START the ruling suggests also that it applies to either a statutory or UNK reorganization STOP
START hence , a successor corporation in a c reorganization appears entitled to UNK for a refund of taxes paid by the UNK corporation despite section UNK STOP
START in a b reorganization , followed by a section UNK UNK , those cases which hold that section UNK is UNK to UNK in UNK appear to permit the successor corporation to UNK for refund of taxes paid by the transferor STOP
START in fact , a cash purchase of a UNK stock followed by UNK might also be an effective way to transfer a claim for refund if the UNK doctrine is not applied to eliminate the intermediate step STOP
START these results appear sound STOP
START as stated in UNK and numerous other cases , the two primary reasons for the UNK of section UNK of the united states code were to prevent the government from having to deal with more than one UNK and to prevent the assignment of UNK claims on a UNK basis STOP
START the cases have allowed transfer of claims if UNK ownership is not changed STOP
START the first reason would never apply to a reorganization transfer which meets the conditions of section UNK , which is the only type presently under discussion STOP
START section UNK applies only to a transfer by UNK of a UNK owned to the extent of at least UNK per cent , a statutory UNK or UNK , an acquisition of substantially all a UNK UNK solely in exchange for voting stock , or a change of identity , form , or place of organization STOP
START in virtually every case the transferor corporation is UNK , and its former stockholders either own UNK , or have a continuing stock interest in , the UNK which gave rise to the tax STOP
START in these circumstances the possibility of multiple or UNK claims is UNK remote STOP
START furthermore , in a c reorganization the continuing interest of stockholders of the corporation which paid the tax must be greater than is necessary in a statutory UNK , to which the statute is clearly UNK STOP
START nor is it at all likely that a `` desperate '' claim against the government will be assigned on a UNK basis in the UNK of a UNK reorganization STOP
START if the transferor has substantial UNK other than the claim , it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to acquire all of its properties in the UNK hope of UNK a claim for refund of taxes STOP
START if such an UNK UNK were to take place , it would more UNK be accomplished by a stock purchase , followed by the UNK of the claim by the UNK UNK , followed by UNK STOP
START in the rare case where a UNK only substantial UNK , or its most important one , is a claim for refund , perhaps its transfer should not be permitted , whether the reorganization takes the form of a statutory UNK or of the acquisition of UNK for stock STOP
START it appears , then , that although the matter is not dealt with in section UNK , a successor corporation in a reorganization of a type specified in section UNK is entitled to UNK for refund of taxes paid by a transferor corporation STOP
START section UNK of the united states code has been interpreted as not applying to claims against the government transferred in UNK UNK STOP
START the successor corporations have been held entitled to UNK on such claims STOP
START other tax attributes of the transferor STOP
START there are certain tax attributes of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the facts of the particular reorganization involved STOP
START for example , property `` used in the trade or business '' of a transferor corporation , as defined in section UNK , presumably would not UNK its special status following a UNK reorganization if it is not so used in the business of the UNK corporation STOP
START the parent of a group filing UNK returns might be treated as the same corporation following a reorganization defined in section UNK , but as a different corporation for this purpose after a UNK acquisition by another corporation which had not , for example , elected to file UNK returns with its own UNK STOP
START similar considerations presumably made it difficult to UNK a general rule where the acquired and UNK corporations have different methods of accounting ( section UNK ) or UNK ( section UNK ) STOP
START other sections of the 1954 internal revenue code provide for survival of certain of a UNK tax attributes following a UNK reorganization STOP
START section UNK requires carryover of the transferor UNK basis for property transferred , and section UNK provides for UNK on the UNK holding period for such property to that of the UNK STOP
START section UNK permits a person UNK UNK facilities to UNK to continue UNK over a UNK period STOP
START however , a similar privilege was not specifically provided in section UNK for a person UNK emergency facilities STOP
START attributes similar to a loss carryover STOP
START there may be certain items which are quite similar to a net operating loss carryover or operating UNK and whose right to survive a reorganization should perhaps be subject to the conditions applicable to those items STOP
START for example , suppose another excess profits tax similar to prior laws is enacted , providing for carryover of excess profits UNK STOP
START this carryover right has a number of things in common with a net operating loss carryover STOP
START it is an UNK device intended to ease the tax burden of UNK income ; ; STOP
START it is a tax benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which UNK to have a high excess profits tax STOP
START under the UNK code this item was permitted to survive a UNK reorganization in the UNK UNK case , but only over the UNK of judge learned hand , who wrote the majority opinion in the UNK case , a leading case requiring carryover of UNK and profits in a UNK reorganization STOP
START since this type of item was not in the statute when section UNK was enacted in 1954 , one cannot say with certainty what effect the UNK of that section should have STOP
START with respect to this type of item , one might properly apply the language of the committee report , quoted above , which UNK against using section UNK as a basis for UNK other tax attributes not mentioned UNK STOP
START actually , there do not presently appear to be items in the statute comparable to a net operating loss carryover STOP
START probably the primary reason for special treatment of a net operating loss carryover is the unique opportunity it presents for tax UNK STOP
START a STOP
START reasons for selecting mail questionnaire method STOP
START there were two methods that could have been used for UNK the study within the resources available : ( 1 ) interviews in depth with a few selected companies , and ( 2 ) the more limited UNK of a large number of companies by means of a mail questionnaire STOP
START while the method of UNK a small number of companies was UNK because of the opportunity it might have furnished to UNK fully the reasons and circumstances of a company's practices and opinions , it also involved the risk of paying UNK attention to the unique and peculiar problems of just a few individual companies STOP
START as a result , it was decided that a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more effective in determining the general practices and opinions of small firms and in UNK some of the fundamental and UNK problems of defense procurement that concern both industry and government STOP
START it was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest UNK inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more detailed nature STOP
START it is recognized that a mail questionnaire has inherent limitations STOP
START there is the danger that the questions will mean different things to different UNK STOP
START simple `` yes '' or `` no '' answers do not reveal the different UNK of opinion that the various UNK may have STOP
START a UNK may want to make alternative answers because he does not know the precise circumstances assumed in the question STOP
START there is also the problem of the UNK frame of reference STOP
START is the UNK making a recommendation for his own benefit , for the benefit of his industry , for the benefit of a specific government department or service , for the benefit of the defense program , for the benefit of small business , or for the benefit of the UNK ? ? STOP
START there is also the question of whether the UNK based his answers on UNK information and carefully considered judgment , or whether his answers were UNK UNK STOP
START finally , there is the question of how strongly an expressed opinion is held -- whether it is a firm opinion or one that the UNK UNK only slightly over the alternatives STOP
START the research team was very UNK of these UNK and limitations of a mail questionnaire STOP
START under the circumstances , however , the team considered it would provide the most useful information at this point STOP
START in the preparation of the questionnaire the problems noted above were carefully considered , and the structure and UNK used were designed to minimize the effects of these limitations STOP
START b STOP
START design of the questionnaire STOP
START the questionnaire was designed to UNK three types of information : ( 1 ) the facts regarding certain characteristics of the UNK , including their experience with , and interest in , UNK defense business ; ; STOP
START ( 2 ) the actual selling and buying practices of the UNK ; ; STOP
START and ( 3 ) the attitudes and opinions of the UNK concerning UNK procedures and the methods of UNK defense contracts STOP
START it was hoped that the facts concerning the characteristics and practices of the UNK would offer UNK to the reasons why they took the positions and made the recommendations which they did STOP
START the major sections of the questionnaire ( see UNK b ) are devoted to the following : 1 STOP
START information for UNK UNK ( part a of the questionnaire ) 2 STOP
START characteristics of defense sales activities ( part b of the questionnaire ) 3 STOP
START UNK practices in UNK in UNK UNK for defense business ( part c of the questionnaire ) 4 STOP
START UNK practices in UNK in UNK UNK for defense purposes ( part d of the questionnaire ) 5 STOP
START UNK opinions regarding UNK UNK ( part e of the questionnaire ) 6 STOP
START UNK opinions regarding UNK UNK ( part f of the questionnaire ) 7 STOP
START UNK UNK regarding the methods of UNK defense contracts ( part g of the questionnaire ) STOP
START the questionnaire provided a place for the name of the UNK but stated that identification of the UNK was UNK STOP
START the questionnaire also stated that , in any event , all UNK would be treated UNK STOP
START it is interesting to note that 75 per cent of those who returned the questionnaire identified themselves STOP
START c STOP
START preparation and UNK of the questionnaire STOP
START the research team prepared and then revised the questionnaire over a period of six months STOP
START in june , 1960 , an early draft of the questionnaire , along with a cover letter , was mailed to fourteen companies in the state of washington STOP
START several days after the companies had received the questionnaire , members of the research team UNK the UNK of eleven of these companies in person or by UNK to discuss any UNK or difficulties the UNK might have experienced in UNK the questionnaire STOP
START this test resulted in further UNK of the questionnaire STOP
START the research team was concerned that responses from firms in the state of washington might not be typical of those throughout the country , or that the results might be different when no UNK or personal UNK was made STOP
START accordingly , another test of the UNK was made STOP
START the revised draft was mailed in july , 1960 , to 100 firms throughout the united states STOP
START fifty of the 100 firms were selected on a random basis from UNK names submitted by member companies of the UNK industries association ( UNK list ) and fifty were selected in a similar manner from a list of UNK names UNK by the research team from the thomas register ( UNK list ) STOP
START the method of UNK the UNK and UNK lists will be described later STOP
START ten days after the UNK were mailed , UNK UNK UNK were sent UNK those companies which had not yet returned their UNK to do so at once STOP
START UNK returns in all were received STOP
START the responses were carefully checked for obvious errors in the answers or for questions that were apparently not understood by the UNK STOP
START the cover letter , questionnaire , and UNK UNK were then revised into final form ( see UNK a , b , and c ) STOP
START d STOP
START UNK of UNK lists STOP
START the objective of the study was to determine the opinions and practices of small firms selling to defense programs STOP
START the firms to receive the UNK were selected with this objective in mind STOP
START three lists of companies were made and used in the study STOP
START the first was a list of fourteen manufacturing companies located in the state of washington which were personally known to the research team to be active in defense work STOP
START the primary consideration in the UNK of this list was UNK in discussing the questionnaire with company officers STOP
START the second list was derived from a group of approximately UNK names supplied to the research team by the UNK industries association STOP
START these names were UNK from member companies by the association from the UNK sources listed in UNK aj STOP
START each source selected from its approved UNK list about 200 firms which it believed to be small businesses that UNK in the production of weapons and weapon support systems STOP
START where possible , the name of an executive was supplied along with the company name and address STOP
START the UNK lists supplied by the UNK member companies were UNK and UNK names were eliminated STOP
START there was further UNK of all companies that were not accompanied by the name of a responsible company executive STOP
START the remaining names were then checked against the thomas register list ( see below ) and UNK names were removed from the UNK lists STOP
START by these steps the final UNK list was reduced from UNK to UNK STOP
START the third list was selected by the research team on a random basis from the thomas register STOP
START it was UNK as a control sample to determine if the opinions and practices of companies on the lists submitted by the members of the UNK industries association were UNK different from those of other small firms selling to defense programs STOP
START such a difference might have resulted from : 1 STOP
START the fact that the UNK industries association members whose lists were used did not UNK all firms engaged in defense programs STOP
START 2 STOP
START the fact that companies on the UNK lists were already UNK in the defense program because of the manner of their selection STOP
START accordingly , as `` UNK '' , they might have different opinions and practices than an `` UNK '' composed of those companies not so UNK but interested in defense business STOP
START 3 STOP
START the fact that UNK lists might not have been selected on a random basis STOP
START the control sample was selected by taking the bottom name of each of the two columns of names on each page of the UNK UNK of manufacturers in the thomas register STOP
START if the bottom name in each column did not have a responsible executive identified , the next name above which identified such a responsible executive was substituted STOP
START fifteen hundred names were selected in this fashion STOP
START e STOP
START UNK the questionnaire STOP
START each questionnaire was mailed with a cover letter UNK personally to the president or other executive of each firm STOP
START the UNK were mailed in UNK , washington , and sent by regular mail to addresses in the states of UNK , UNK , UNK , and washington STOP
START UNK was used for the addresses outside the pacific northwest STOP
START each letter contained a UNK return UNK by regular mail for addresses in the pacific northwest , and by UNK for those outside the pacific northwest STOP
START approximately ten days after the questionnaire was mailed , a UNK UNK UNK was sent to each of the original names STOP
START the first test UNK ( to 14 companies ) was made in june , 1960 STOP
START the second test UNK ( to 100 companies ) was made in july , 1960 STOP
START the final UNK of the questionnaire was made late in august , 1960 , to UNK firms consisting of UNK from the UNK list and UNK from the UNK list STOP
START f STOP
START returns received STOP
START over UNK returns were received within two weeks after the final UNK was made STOP
START they continued to arrive until the end of december , 1960 , by which time a total of UNK returns were received representing UNK per cent of the UNK UNK sent out STOP
START UNK returns could not be used because they were incomplete or received too late to be processed STOP
START the remaining UNK returns that were processed came from the categories in table 2 STOP
START g STOP
START processing the returns STOP
START each questionnaire was UNK for obvious UNK and for comments , and was identified by a UNK number , by the source list from which the company name was selected , and by the geographical location of the company as determined by the UNK on the return UNK STOP
START all responses , except comments , were UNK UNK to permit use of UNK equipment STOP
START the codes were UNK into UNK UNK cards and UNK STOP
START each return required three cards and involved key UNK UNK UNK columns STOP
START in order to be able to properly UNK the data for a single company each of the three cards UNK the set for each firm was identified with the appropriate UNK number of the UNK STOP
START the cards were then processed using standard UNK UNK card equipment , including an UNK UNK UNK STOP
START the first step in processing was to UNK the returns from questions 1 , 2 , and 3 to determine whether the UNK were large businesses or small businesses , in accordance with the UNK contained in UNK section UNK STOP
START ( see chapter 2 STOP
START ) the results are shown in table 3 STOP
START the returns from companies classified as large businesses were set aside and not used because they were not relevant to a study of the opinions and practices of small firms STOP
START the second step in processing was to compare the responses from companies on the UNK list with those from companies on the UNK list in order to determine whether it would be appropriate to UNK the responses for the purposes of the study STOP
START the methods and results of this comparative analysis are described in UNK aj STOP
START it was concluded that it would be appropriate to process the two groups of responses as a single sample of all small businesses engaged in , or UNK to sell to , defense programs STOP
START in the first place , the two groups of firms , when combined , had characteristics and practices that were more representative of companies that were the subject of this study than did the firms from the UNK list alone STOP
START the vast central valley of california is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world STOP
START during the summer of 1960 , it became the setting for a bitter and basic UNK struggle STOP
START the UNK in this economic struggle are the agricultural workers UNK committee ( UNK ) of the UNK and the agricultural UNK of the state STOP
START by virtue of the legal responsibilities of the department of employment in the farm placement program , we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces STOP
START it is not a pleasant or easy position , but one we have UNK to maintain STOP
START we have sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties , but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they UNK STOP
START inevitably , one side was pleased and the other UNK , regardless of how we ruled STOP
START often the UNK parties interpreted our decision as UNK UNK toward the other STOP
START we have UNK ourselves with the thought that this is a normal human reaction and is one of the consequences of any decision in an UNK proceeding STOP
START it is UNK , nevertheless , to read in a labor weekly , `` UNK UNK down to UNK '' , and then to be confronted with a UNK publication which states , `` UNK UNK obviously UNK and UNK strikes as UNK UNK '' STOP
START for a number of years , there have been UNK attempts in california to UNK farm workers STOP
START these attempts met with little UNK for a variety of reasons STOP
START they were UNK financed , without experienced leadership , and lacked the general support of organized labor as a whole STOP
START this past year the pattern has been different : the UNK program had the full support of the UNK , which supplied staff and money to the UNK , as well as moral support STOP
START leadership was experienced and UNK , and financial resources were significant STOP
START regardless of where personal UNK may lie as between the parties , failure to recognize these changed conditions would be to ignore the facts of life STOP
START as a result of these changed conditions , the impact of the UNK effort on agricultural UNK relations has been much greater than in the past STOP
START the UNK has been able to UNK the traditional weapons of labor -- the strike and the UNK line -- with considerable success , particularly in the area of wages STOP
START by the very nature of the situation , it is the union which has been able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management STOP
START to date , at least , the strategy of the UNK has been selective ; ; STOP
START that is to say , to UNK on a particular crop or activity in a particular area at a strategic time , rather than any UNK UNK with management throughout an area or the state STOP
START primarily , we became involved in these UNK because of our UNK obligations under our farm placement program STOP
START normally , because agricultural labor is not covered by UNK insurance , we would not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit payments under the trade dispute provision of the UNK insurance code , although such a situation is quite within the realm of possibility STOP
START but the current issues UNK out of the UNK act concerning UNK to an establishment where a labor dispute exists , and out of public law UNK and the UNK labor agreement if mexican UNK were employed at the ranch STOP
START most of us remember and think of the UNK act in its historical sense , as a major UNK in the development of public placement services STOP
START UNK do we think of it as a living , continuing , operating control over the system STOP
START however , when labor UNK arise , its provisions come clearly into play STOP
START california has accepted the provisions of that act ( as have all other states ) by UNK into our code ( section UNK ) a provision that STOP
START the state of california UNK the provisions of the UNK act , and will observe and UNK with the requirements of that act STOP
START with respect to labor UNK , the UNK act states only , STOP
START in carrying out the provisions of this act , the secretary is authorized and directed to provide for the giving of notice of strikes or UNK to UNK before they are referred to employment STOP
START other provisions of the act UNK the secretary to UNK regulations necessary to carry out its provisions , and he has done so STOP
START the pertinent regulation for our purposes is section UNK ( , ) , as follows : STOP
START UNK in labor dispute situations STOP
START no person shall be referred to a position the filling of which will aid directly or indirectly in filling a job which ( 1 ) is UNK because the former UNK is on strike or is being locked out in the course of a labor dispute , or ( 2 ) the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute STOP
START with respect to positions not covered by UNK ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) of this UNK , any individual may be referred to a place of employment in which a labor dispute exists , provided he is given written notice of such dispute prior to or at the time of his UNK STOP
START in UNK this regulation , let us take the last sentence first STOP
START it permits UNK under certain circumstances even when there is a labor dispute , provided the individual is given written notice of such a dispute STOP
START assume , for example , a situation where a farm has a packing UNK and fields STOP
START the packing UNK workers go on strike STOP
START there is no dispute involving UNK STOP
START we concluded that we may refer workers to the UNK ( but not the packing UNK work ) provided we give them written notice of the packing UNK dispute STOP
START so far , no UNK cases have UNK under this provision STOP
START it is the first part of the regulation that is currently at issue STOP
START note that it UNK UNK under either condition ( 1 ) or condition ( 2 ) STOP
START UNK representatives have contended that the secretary has gone beyond his authority by such a UNK , on the grounds that the UNK act requires only written notice to the prospective worker that a dispute exists STOP
START into court STOP
START the matter got into the courts this way : one of the early strikes called by the UNK was at the UNK UNK UNK in UNK county STOP
START we found that a labor dispute existed , and that the workers had left their jobs , which were then UNK because of the dispute STOP
START accordingly , under UNK ( 1 ) of the UNK regulation , we suspended UNK to the UNK STOP
START ( UNK , no mexican UNK were involved STOP
START ) the UNK , seeking to continue his UNK , UNK our right to cease UNK to him , and sought relief in the superior court of UNK county STOP
START the court issued a temporary UNK order , UNK us to UNK UNK STOP
START we , of course , UNK the court order STOP
START however , the attorney general of california , at the request of the secretary of labor , sought to have the jurisdiction over the issue removed to the federal district court , on grounds that it was UNK a federal issue since the validity of the UNK regulation was being UNK STOP
START however , the federal court held that since the state had accepted the provisions of the UNK act into its own code , and presumably therefore also the regulations , it was now a state matter STOP
START it accordingly refused to assume jurisdiction , UNK the california superior court made the UNK order permanent STOP
START under that order , we have continued referring workers to the ranch STOP
START a similar case UNK at the UNK ranch in UNK county , and the superior court of that county issued similar UNK orders STOP
START the UNK have UNK argued that i should have accepted the superior court decisions as UNK and issued UNK instructions to our staff to ignore this provision in the UNK regulation STOP
START i cannot accept that view , either as a lawyer or as an UNK STOP
START legal considerations STOP
START first , let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved STOP
START it is an accepted UNK principle in california that a superior court decision does not constitute a binding legal UNK STOP
START it is UNK , unless UNK , only upon the particular parties to the particular action which was heard STOP
START it is not binding upon another superior court , which could rule to the contrary STOP
START only when a decision is rendered by the district court of appeal ( or , of course , the supreme court ) is a binding UNK established STOP
START in that event , we can correctly say that we have received an UNK interpretation of the matter , and one which we can follow UNK with confidence that the policy will not be UNK in other superior courts STOP
START but over and beyond the UNK need for a binding UNK decision , i am convinced that the decisions of the superior courts which in effect UNK the UNK regulation are not a correct interpretation of the UNK power under the federal law STOP
START i believe i am in good company in this view STOP
START the attorney general of california UNK in this interpretation and has filed an appeal from these decisions to the district court of appeal STOP
START the attorney general of the united states , in considering the power of the secretary to issue similar regulations under the UNK act relating to the UNK UNK of farm workers , has rendered an opinion UNK his authority STOP
START further , and as an evidence of legislative UNK only , the senate of the united states recently UNK by a substantial majority the `` UNK UNK '' to the fair labor standards act , which would have specifically limited the UNK authority of the secretary in these matters STOP
START next , let us consider briefly the program and administrative implications of a failure on our part to pursue our UNK STOP
START there is far too much at UNK for all of the parties concerned to leave the matter UNK in UNK STOP
START the UNK of the issue are enormous STOP
START a decision to refer workers to jobs UNK because of a strike would have to be applied equally to UNK situations , and might in effect place the public employment services in the position of acting as UNK STOP
START the public interest is so dominant in such an issue that i cannot be so UNK as to attempt to settle it by an administrative order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action in one or two superior courts in the state STOP
START it is an issue which may well reach the supreme court of the united states before judicial UNK is achieved STOP
START as an UNK , i cannot place the employment service in california in UNK of being out of UNK with the federal laws by my failure to pursue the UNK of appeal open to me STOP
START to have applied UNK the decisions of the two cases heard in superior court , in my opinion , would have placed us clearly out of UNK with the UNK act and would have immediately opened the way for the secretary of labor , were he so inclined , to UNK the governor of such UNK , set a date for hearing , and issue his finding STOP
START the impact of UNK under the UNK act is clear : the UNK of some UNK million a year of administrative funds which finance our employment service program or , as a UNK , the taking over by the federal government of its operation STOP
START thus far , the cases which have come before the courts have involved only the issue of UNK where the job is UNK due to a strike -- condition ( 1 ) in the regulation of the secretary STOP
START none has yet UNK under condition ( 2 ) , relating to UNK to jobs `` the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute '' STOP
START here the problem is essentially one of UNK the word `` filling '' STOP
START should it be defined in a narrow sense to include only such elements as job UNK , union membership , union jurisdiction , and the like ? ? STOP
START or should it have a broader UNK of including wage demands and other factors not necessarily associated with the mechanics of `` filling '' the job STOP
START because of the uncertainty of this definition , i UNK the interpretation of the secretary of labor STOP
START he has advised me that the UNK interpretation is the proper one ; ; STOP
START that is , that if wages , for example , is the only issue in a labor dispute , and no workers have left their jobs because of the dispute , we may continue to make UNK STOP
START 9 STOP
START UNK and UNK present evidence that UNK and young children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple UNK level simply by UNK objects and UNK them STOP
START after they have developed concepts , they are free from the necessity of UNK objects ; ; STOP
START they do UNK what they once had to do UNK STOP
START the ability to think seems to increase consistently with age STOP
START one experiment showed the greatest UNK difference occurring between the UNK and UNK years STOP
START 10 STOP
START many studies indicate that UNK children's interests cover the whole field of science ; ; STOP
START that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes and events ; ; STOP
START and that as they mature their interests and capabilities change and UNK STOP
START emotional characteristics STOP
START how a child feels about himself , about other people , and about the tasks UNK him in school may have as much influence on his success in school as his physical and intellectual characteristics STOP
START a considerable amount of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and UNK child is not likely to do well in school subjects STOP
START emotional maturity is the result of many factors , the principal ones being the experiences of the first few years of the child's life STOP
START however , the teacher who UNK the influence of emotions on behavior may be highly influential in helping pupils gain confidence , security , and satisfaction STOP
START concerning this responsibility of the teacher , suggestions for helping children gain better control of the emotions are presented in chapter 11 STOP
START the following UNK about the emotional characteristics of UNK children may be helpful STOP
START 1 STOP
START typically , the young child's emotional reactions last for a relatively short time , as UNK to those of an adult STOP
START 2 STOP
START as the child grows older , his emotional reactions lead to `` UNK '' , or emotional states drawn out over a period of time and expressed slowly , rather than in short , abrupt UNK STOP
START 3 STOP
START studies of the growth and decline of children's fears indicate that fears due to strange objects , UNK , falling , and unexpected movement decline during the UNK years , but that fears of the dark , of being alone , and of imaginary creatures or UNK increase STOP
START 4 STOP
START UNK a child for being afraid or UNK him to meet the UNK situation alone are poor ways of dealing with the problem ; ; STOP
START more effective solutions include UNK , the example of another child , or conditioning by UNK the UNK object , place , or person with something pleasant STOP
START 5 STOP
START children need help in learning to control their emotions STOP
START the young child UNK from parents and teachers that UNK UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK will not get him what he wants ; ; STOP
START the older child UNK that intense emotional UNK will not win approval by his UNK , and , therefore , makes a real effort to control his emotions STOP
START 6 STOP
START children differ widely in their emotional responses STOP
START among UNK the patterns of emotional responses are similar ; ; STOP
START as the influence of learning and environment are felt , emotional behavior becomes UNK STOP
START social characteristics STOP
START although no national norms exist for the social development of children , the teacher can find a great deal of information concerning types of social behavior normally displayed by children at various age levels STOP
START the following summary will give the student some idea about the social characteristics of UNK children ; ; STOP
START the student will certainly want to UNK more deeply into the UNK study of UNK individuals , struggling to meet their UNK needs , and at the same time trying to learn the rules of the game in the UNK number of groups in which they hold membership STOP
START 1 STOP
START during early childhood , children are more interested in the approval of their parents and teachers than they are in the approval of other children ; ; STOP
START after they have been in school a few years , their interest in UNK of their own age increases , and their interest in adults UNK ; ; STOP
START the child who had once considered it a treat to UNK his parents on UNK and family UNK now considers it a bore STOP
START in late childhood the influence of the group on the social behavior of the child continues to increase ; ; STOP
START the group sets the styles in clothing , the kind of play engaged in , and the ideals of right and wrong behavior STOP
START 2 STOP
START in early childhood the choice of a UNK is likely to be for another child of his own age or a year or two older , who can do the things he likes to do ; ; STOP
START such factors as sex , intelligence , and status in the group do not influence his choice much at this time STOP
START 3 STOP
START in later childhood , an interest in team games UNK individual play ; ; STOP
START loyalty to the group , a feeling of UNK over those who are not members , and UNK to play with members of the opposite sex become dominant UNK STOP
START 4 STOP
START during early childhood boys UNK and UNK , on the average , more than girls ; ; STOP
START those who feel UNK or UNK UNK in these activities more than do UNK children STOP
START 5 STOP
START during late childhood boys like to UNK , UNK , and talk UNK to girls ; ; STOP
START girls , who are more mature than boys , UNK upon the UNK UNK of boys of their own age STOP
START 6 STOP
START by the time pupils reach the sixth grade , their ethical and moral standards are fairly well developed ; ; STOP
START they exhibit a UNK interest in social , political , and economic problems , but they frequently have vague and UNK notions about the terms they use rather UNK in their routine school work STOP
START 7 STOP
START between the ages of two and four years , UNK or resistance to adult authority is UNK ; ; STOP
START after the fourth year it begins to decline STOP
START however , as we have seen , in later childhood the child begins to substitute the standards of the UNK group for those of parents and teachers STOP
START 8 STOP
START the UNK child grows gradually in his ability to work in groups STOP
START the child in the primary grades can play UNK with one UNK , but his desire to be first in everything gets him into trouble when the group gets larger ; ; STOP
START he wants to be with people , but he UNK yet learned to UNK STOP
START in the middle grades , however , he begins to participate more effectively in group activities such as selecting a leader , helping to make plans and carry on group activities , and setting up rules governing the enterprise STOP
START why the teacher should study the individual pupil STOP
START much progress has been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for understanding children , yet in almost any classroom today can be found children whose needs are not being met by the school program STOP
START some are UNK to achieve as much as their ability would permit ; ; STOP
START others never seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom STOP
START these children have been described as those who were trying to say something to adults who did not understand STOP
START many school systems now UNK school psychologists and child guidance specialists STOP
START these specialists perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children who need special attention , by UNK ways of meeting the needs of individual children in the regular classroom , and by providing clinical services for severely UNK children STOP
START it is the classroom teacher , however , who has daily contacts with pupils , and who is in a unique position to put sound psychological principles into practice STOP
START indeed , a study of the individual child is an integral part of the work of the UNK teacher , rather than merely an additional UNK STOP
START teachers and UNK in many UNK schools have assumed that UNK the pupils in any grade into groups on the basis of test scores UNK the problem of meeting the needs of individuals STOP
START what they should recognize is that children who have been placed in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still differ widely in attributes that influence success , and that they still must be treated as individuals STOP
START although the teacher must be concerned with maintaining standards , he must also be concerned about understanding differences in ability , background , and experience STOP
START factors that UNK learning and lead to UNK STOP
START studies conducted in various sections of the united states indicate that many children in UNK schools are UNK UNK , and that many of them are UNK to make satisfactory progress in school subjects STOP
START one study , which involved UNK pupils in grades one to six , found that 12 percent of the pupils were seriously UNK and that 23 percent were reading a year below capacity STOP
START it is apparent , therefore , that the teacher needs to know what factors have a vital bearing on the learning and adjustment of children STOP
START when a child UNK to meet the standards of the school in his rate of learning , UNK , UNK , and other forms of UNK frequently follow STOP
START these UNK in turn UNK learning , and a UNK cycle is completed STOP
START it is easy for the teacher to UNK that the child who is not achieving in accordance with his known ability is just plain UNK , or that the child who UNK interest in school , who UNK the teacher , or who is UNK is a UNK UNK STOP
START the causes of UNK and UNK may be found in physical factors , such as UNK speech or hearing , UNK vision , UNK motor coordination , a UNK constitution , UNK disease , UNK , and UNK UNK STOP
START they may be caused by poor health habits , such as UNK UNK and sleeping habits STOP
START they may be related to mental UNK or lack of UNK for certain types of school work STOP
START the curriculum may be too difficult for some and too easy for others STOP
START teaching methods , learning materials , and promotion policies may UNK learning and lead to UNK for some children STOP
START UNK family relations , broken homes , and UNK community influences may also be contributing factors STOP
START this is only a minimum list of the factors that UNK learning and contribute to UNK among children STOP
START moreover , these conditions do not influence all children in the same manner STOP
START a vision UNK that may produce UNK tension and reading UNK for one child may UNK another child on to even greater achievement in reading STOP
START an UNK home that may UNK one child may constitute the UNK causing another to work harder for successful achievement in school STOP
START at any rate , the teacher who UNK common causes of UNK and UNK can frequently do a great deal to eliminate the causes of pupil UNK , failure , and UNK STOP
START sources of information about children STOP
START successful teaching involves getting enough information about each pupil to understand why he UNK as he does in certain situations and how his achievement in school is being influenced by various factors in his environment STOP
START the classroom teacher cannot be expected to be as UNK in the use of the techniques of child study as the clinical UNK ; ; STOP
START he cannot be expected to UNK all the tests and UNK all the information needed about each child in his classroom STOP
START he can be expected , however , to examine and UNK the information already available ; ; STOP
START to UNK and extend his own techniques for studying individual children ; ; STOP
START and to UNK opportunities , arising in connection with regular classroom activities , for UNK a better understanding of his pupils STOP
START this section deals with some of the sources of information that can be UNK by the classroom teacher ; ; STOP
START chapter 15 provides more detailed information about specific techniques used in UNK pupil progress STOP
START cumulative records STOP
START most school systems today maintain a system of cumulative records of pupils STOP
START these records , when UNK maintained , provide much information about the children , which the teacher can use in guidance , instruction , UNK , and reporting to parents STOP
START each teacher has in his classroom a metal file , equipped with a UNK , which is used to store cumulative record UNK STOP
START during summer vacation periods these records are stored in the office of the principal STOP
START only the teacher and other professional personnel are permitted to see or use these records STOP
START each new teacher to whom the pupil goes is expected to study the information in the cumulative record and to bring it up to date STOP
START some school systems provide written instructions to UNK and teachers UNK when certain information is to be recorded on cumulative record forms and UNK how the information is to be UNK and used STOP
START the summary report on desegregation progress in education in the UNK region , 1959 - 1960 '' clearly shows two pieces of information STOP
START the summary report , which was prepared for this conference , indicates , first , that actual or UNK school desegregation is increasing ; ; STOP
START second , that both actual and UNK desegregation is , with few exceptions , the product or result of court order STOP
START the report together with other information suggests that desegregation in the schools is slow STOP
START the UNK region , as defined by the national association of UNK relations officials ( UNK ) , consists of the states of UNK , maryland , tennessee , west virginia , delaware , virginia and the district of columbia STOP
START the states and the nation's capital all have some desegregation , in fact some UNK back to 1954 ; ; STOP
START but the region also UNK some of the UNK opposition STOP
START desegregation has been opposed by massive resistance , UNK , pupil assignment ( with no assignments of negro children ) , and hate UNK STOP
START desegregation and court order STOP
START now UNK look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation and such increase as a result of court order STOP
START first UNK STOP
START UNK school desegregation came to UNK and union counties , which already had high school desegregation STOP
START the action was a result of a court order , the UNK for which ( and for other court action mentioned in this paper ) is taken from the summary report for this conference STOP
START in maryland the UNK county board of education had prepared a desegregation plan which the court approved but which a UNK had UNK ; ; STOP
START thus , county school board and federal court joined hands here to promote school desegregation STOP
START additional school desegregation in tennessee resulted from a court order opening a school serving children of military personnel STOP
START similarly , further desegregation may come from suits UNK in three tennessee cities , UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START in west virginia the number of white and negro children attending the same school has increased almost UNK STOP
START there are no court decisions here STOP
START as in maryland , a district court has approved an official plan of school desegregation in delaware STOP
START as a result of the state board of education plan , negro children entered UNK white UNK schools in five districts STOP
START the third circuit court of UNK is UNK an appeal from the plan STOP
START in virginia court orders led to desegregation in UNK and UNK counties STOP
START desegregation in UNK county is UNK because of court order , although date of admission is not yet determined STOP
START negro parents have filed application for admission of additional children to schools in UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK counties STOP
START desegregation can also result from additional suits brought by negro UNK against school boards in newport news , UNK county , UNK county , and UNK STOP
START as a school district , the district of columbia has had UNK schools since 1954 , shortly after the supreme court decision STOP
START this UNK makes it clear that school desegregation continues , including the old UNK state , in spite of its UNK resistance STOP
START the record is clear that increase in school desegregation last year came largely as a result of a court order ; ; STOP
START that on the immediate horizon , if further UNK ( relatively speaking ) desegregation comes , it will result from court orders on suits filed in several UNK states STOP
START knowledge that thousands of school districts are involved and observation that school desegregation has occurred in only a UNK in UNK leads to a conclusion that UNK is slow STOP
START before turning to my views as to the problems and issues before us at this regional conference , i wish to note a small item in the summary report as it refers to the district of columbia STOP
START that reference in the report is `` continuation of the trend toward an UNK school system '' , a remark apparently UNK by the increase of negro school population from UNK per cent to UNK per cent STOP
START i see no real prospects for an UNK school population STOP
START west of rock UNK park is still UNK white and is in fact increasingly white as a result of UNK UNK housing program STOP
START nearby UNK bottom is UNK negroes STOP
START the large UNK in the southwest UNK area UNK white people -- what with UNK town houses and UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK hill rehabilitation , like UNK bottom , UNK negroes with UNK ( but also UNK some UNK with other UNK ) STOP
START the UNK break with tradition , the past and present of `` white ring around a black core '' , may come with the opening of nearby UNK county suburbs to negro UNK and , presumably , the UNK conclusion of some UNK that they cannot escape the negro by UNK to the suburbs STOP
START in fact , short of UNK to UNK , virginia , or UNK , maryland , white people may have to live with negroes STOP
START all of this must be taken into account before the image of an `` UNK '' UNK school system is UNK up STOP
START problems to solve STOP
START from the summary report before us at this conference , a number of problems are apparent STOP
START they UNK us and UNK us but generally do not divide us like the issues which follow the problems STOP
START first , how can we step up the desegregation movement ? ? STOP
START it is slow STOP
START i believe we all want more schools where white and negro together can and do attend STOP
START i believe we all want no child denied admission to a school on account of his color STOP
START in general , members of UNK would certainly want a child admitted to a school nearest his residence or within his residence UNK STOP
START how to achieve this objective is a problem , but we are not divided on what we want STOP
START second , as we increase the number of UNK school districts and schools themselves , how can we achieve this action through school board action ? ? STOP
START it may be county school board or state school board action , as well as that of municipal school boards STOP
START UNK , can we reduce the role of the district courts , so that the action is that of the people of the community or other school district and not that of the law court ? ? STOP
START this is a problem , and i believe there is little difference of opinion that wherever possible a local school board should UNK and effect a plan of desegregation STOP
START third , how can we insure a systematic and continuing group relations education in the schools ? ? STOP
START not simply a brief program when the schools are actually UNK but a continuing program that also UNK integration , that UNK the children and teachers not to look at each other as white or negro , but as human beings STOP
START again the problem is how to get it done and in what form to offer the group relations education ; ; STOP
START not whether it should be done STOP
START fourth , in the segregated school system , during the period before desegregation , how can we assure equal opportunity ? ? STOP
START in fact , in the UNK school system which may have a good many schools with UNK population , how can we assure equal opportunity ? ? STOP
START this is a problem , but we are not divided over its importance or by its existence STOP
START fifth , in the segregated school system or in the UNK or UNK schools , how can we encourage better group relations or an improved attitude toward people who do not belong to the group ? ? STOP
START can we help children adjust to `` images of other children '' when the latter are not actually present STOP
START now , the issues STOP
START if we have five problems whose solution we seek in relatively united fashion , then there are twice as many issues which , i judge , sharply divide us , UNK relations UNK and lay people STOP
START issue UNK STOP
START pupil assignment STOP
START since on the one hand school desegregation has come in virginia UNK with pupil assignment , shall we support the plan ? ? STOP
START on the basis of pupil assignment UNK , judge albert UNK has assigned negro children to formerly white schools in UNK and UNK , virginia STOP
START shall we support pupil assignment ? ? STOP
START on the other hand , looking at the larger picture , is it true that pupil assignment has effectively cut off , UNK , or reduced school desegregation to a `` UNK '' ? ? STOP
START shall we therefore UNK the plan ? ? STOP
START this question is an issue because it likely UNK us into two camps -- those for or against pupil assignment STOP
START issue UNK STOP
START teacher assignment in order to UNK STOP
START in large cities like baltimore , UNK , and washington , UNK should school desegregation be extended to UNK and UNK schools by UNK white and negro teachers , respectively ? ? STOP
START on the one hand do we argue the supreme court decision required only that a child not be denied admission to a school on account of his race ? ? STOP
START or should we argue that if we want adjustment of children to children of different races and that that is impossible in an UNK school , we must at least provide him some opportunity to adjust to people of another race within the school -- namely , to a teacher of another race STOP
START we can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation impossible teacher assignment can create a partially UNK situation STOP
START issue UNK STOP
START the UNK in school desegregation cases STOP
START the earlier part of my statement deals with the court orders that resulted in desegregation STOP
START in each instance the UNK was a private citizen STOP
START in thousands of school districts , indeed , in the entire state of mississippi , no UNK has come forth STOP
START and i have established that the action of municipal , county , or state school boards or boards of education is small , UNK small in comparison with the number of districts STOP
START is the requirement that the UNK be a person actually denied admission to a school a sound requirement ? ? STOP
START should congress UNK the attorney general to file suit to accomplish admission of a child to a school to which he is denied entrance ? ? STOP
START even though in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the provision for the attorney general to act was eliminated , should we nevertheless support such a UNK ? ? STOP
START this is an issue , for it UNK people rather sharply STOP
START issue UNK STOP
START UNK of funds to schools that deny children on account of race STOP
START this is the UNK UNK , which in 1957 divided even a `` liberal '' group like the american UNK committee ( UNK ) STOP
START should we support a UNK in federal school construction or school assistance legislation that would deny federal funds to a school district that UNK admission to a child on account of his race ? ? STOP
START this is UNK than earlier UNK UNK which would have denied funds to all segregated school districts STOP
START there is UNK considerable argument against the UNK , UNK though it be , on the grounds that federal aid is so necessary to the public schools STOP
START the federal funds UNK UNK the support of many , the opposition of quite a few STOP
START issue UNK STOP
START required public education STOP
START should a political UNK , state or county or UNK , be required to furnish public education ? ? STOP
START for the school year , UNK , the prince edward county ( virginia ) board of UNK voted not to provide funds for public education , and the school board therefore could provide no public education -- for white or negro children STOP
START is public education in this american democracy of such importance that no child should be denied public education ? ? STOP
START or is this subject a matter of UNK , a matter of states rights or county rights ? ? STOP
START if people don't want to provide public education , should they be forced to do so ? ? STOP
START even if we UNK substantial agreement behind UNK public education , we likely cannot expect that all the states will UNK the legislation STOP
START should the requirement , which must therefore be federal in nature , be UNK by the united states congress ? ? STOP
START or must it become law by UNK of the united states constitution ? ? STOP
START we actually have two issues in this question -- goal and method STOP
START issue UNK STOP
START federal responsibility for education of the citizens STOP
START if the above issue is settled by requiring public education for all citizens , issue UNK may be UNK STOP
START if , on the other hand , it is not settled , or while it is being UNK and resolved , does the federal government have a responsibility in situations like that in prince edward county ? ? STOP
START nearly half the children still receive no education STOP
START must or should the federal government help ? ? STOP
START should the government directly provide education for the children who want public education ? ? STOP
START the next question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational UNK STOP
START on the whole , it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way STOP
START seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn STOP
START a UNK issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for UNK youth STOP
START in situations of this sort the board generally UNK the expansion of free education STOP
START UNK studied the records of UNK school board members in twelve western cities over the period of UNK - 40 and found `` little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence '' , as judged by a panel of professional UNK who studied the voting records on educational issues STOP
START the few cases of clear UNK along UNK lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for UNK rather than pay increases for teachers , and such issues are not issues of educational policy STOP
START in general , it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy , and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class values , which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society STOP
START there have been very few cases of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any other class in the field of educational policy STOP
START if there were more such cases , it would be easier to answer the question whether the UNK favor their own social classes STOP
START there is currently a major controversy of public education in which group interests and values are heavily engaged STOP
START this is the issue of segregated schools in the south STOP
START in this case it is primarily a matter of conflict of racial groups rather than UNK groups STOP
START thus , the white middle and lower classes are UNK against the negro middle and lower classes STOP
START this conflict may be resolved in a way which will suit white middle-class people better than it suits white UNK people STOP
START if this happens , there may be some class conflict in the south , with school boards and school teachers taking the middle-class position STOP
START the educational profession STOP
START the members of the educational profession have a major voice in the determination of educational policy , their position being strongest in the universities STOP
START they are mostly UNK and UNK people , with a few in the upper class STOP
START do they make UNK decisions ? ? STOP
START in a society dominated by middle-class values and working in an institution which UNK and UNK these social values , it is clear that the educational profession must work for the values which are characteristic of the society STOP
START there is no problem here STOP
START the problem UNK , if it does arise , when the UNK has to make a choice or a decision within the area of his professional competence , but which bears some relation to the social structure STOP
START for instance , in giving school grades or in making recommendations for the award of a college scholarship , does he UNK or UNK favor students of one or another social class ? ? STOP
START again , in UNK on the content and method of his teaching , does he favor a curriculum which will make his students stronger UNK in the race for higher economic status , or does he favor a curriculum which UNK students in other ways ? ? STOP
START the answers to questions such as these certainly depend to some extent upon the UNK own UNK position and also upon his social history , as well as upon his personality and what he UNK his mission to be as an UNK STOP
START in a set of case studies of teachers with various UNK UNK , UNK UNK a variety of approaches to students and to teaching which depend upon the UNK personality as well as on his UNK background STOP
START one UNK teacher may be a hard UNK for UNK pupils because she wants them to develop the attitudes and skills that will enable them to UNK , while another UNK teacher may be a very UNK person with UNK pupils because he knows their UNK and UNK at home , and he hopes to encourage them by friendly treatment STOP
START one UNK factor which plays a large part in educational policy today is the fact that a great many school and college teachers are upward mobile from urban UNK and UNK families STOP
START their own experience in the social system influences their work and attitudes as teachers STOP
START while this influence is a complex matter , depending upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his UNK experience , there probably are some general statements about UNK background and educational policy that can be made with a fair degree of truth STOP
START teachers who have been upward mobile probably see education as most valuable for their students if it serves students as it has served them ; ; STOP
START that is , they are likely to favor a kind of education that has UNK value STOP
START this does not necessarily mean that such teachers will favor vocational education , as UNK with liberal education , but they are likely to favor an approach to liberal education which has a UNK UNK value , as against a kind of `` pure '' liberal education that is not designed to help people get better jobs STOP
START there is no doubt that higher education since world war 2 , has moved away from `` pure '' liberal education toward greater emphasis on technology and UNK STOP
START there are several causes for this , one being rapid economic development with increasing numbers of of middle-class positions requiring engineering or scientific training STOP
START but another cause may lie in the experience of so many new postwar faculty members with their own use of education as a means of social UNK STOP
START compared with the college and university faculty members of the period from 1900 to UNK , the new postwar faculty members consist of more children of UNK and more children of urban UNK fathers STOP
START their experience is quite in contrast with that of children of UNK and UNK UNK parents , who are more likely to regard education as good for its own sake and to discount the vocational UNK in the curriculum STOP
START the `` public interest '' groups STOP
START educational policies are formed by several groups who are UNK or UNK appointed to act in the public interest STOP
START UNK are one such group , and state UNK have major responsibility for educational legislation STOP
START they generally vote so as to serve their own UNK , and if the UNK should be UNK middle class or UNK lower class , they might be expected to vote and work for UNK or for UNK interests in education STOP
START however , there are relatively few such political UNK , and , as has been pointed out , there is seldom a UNK distinction between the educational interests of one social class and those of another STOP
START another public interest group is the commission of UNK or UNK which is appointed to study an educational problem and to make recommendations STOP
START generally these UNK work UNK to represent the interest of the entire society , as they conceive it STOP
START nevertheless , their conclusions and recommendations cannot please everybody , and they often represent a particular economic or political point of view STOP
START for instance , there have been two presidential UNK on higher education since world war 2 STOP
START president UNK commission on higher education tended to take a liberal , UNK position , while president UNK committee on education beyond the high school was slightly more conservative STOP
START both UNK consisted of UNK and UNK people , who attempted to act in the public interest STOP
START an example of a more definite class UNK is noted in proceedings of the commission on the financing of higher education sponsored by the association of american universities and supported by the UNK foundation and the UNK corporation STOP
START this commission recommended against the use of federal government funds for the assistance of private universities and against a broad program of UNK UNK STOP
START this might be said to be an UNK or an UNK UNK , but the commission published as one of its staff studies a book by UNK UNK entitled who should go to college ? ? STOP
START which recommended a federal government scholarship program STOP
START furthermore , the commission set up the council for financial aid to education as a means of encouraging private business to increase its support of private higher education STOP
START thus , the commission UNK with a sense of social responsibility within the area of its own convictions about the problem of government support to private education STOP
START then there are the trustees and officers of the great educational foundations , who inevitably UNK an influence on educational decisions by their support or refusal to support various educational programs , experiments , and UNK STOP
START these people are practically always UNK or UNK persons , who attempt to act in what they regard as the interest of the entire society STOP
START finally there are the parent organizations and the UNK organizations such as the national association of parents and teachers , and the citizens committee on public schools STOP
START these have an UNK leadership and a middle-class membership , with rare exceptions , where UNK parents are active in local UNK STOP
START like the other UNK groups , these are middle class in their educational attitudes , and they attempt to act in the general public interest , as they see it STOP
START in general , it appears that educational decisions and educational policies are made by people who UNK to act in the interests of the society as a whole STOP
START they are UNK UNK and UNK people , and undoubtedly share the values and attitudes of those classes STOP
START they may be UNK of the existence of UNK values and consequently fail to take them into account STOP
START but there is very little frank and conscious UNK of the interests of any one social class by the people who have the power to make decisions in education STOP
START they think of themselves as trustees for the entire society and try to serve the entire society STOP
START attempts to influence social structure through education STOP
START educational policy in the united states has as an explicit goal the UNK of economic and cultural opportunity STOP
START in so far as this goal is achieved , the society becomes more fluid , artificial UNK to social UNK are reduced , and people at the lower end of the social UNK share more fully in the material and cultural goods of society STOP
START on the other hand , there is a UNK purpose in education which is to pass on the advantages of the parents to their children STOP
START this leads to efforts at UNK through private schools and to the maintenance of social UNK in the schools STOP
START both of these purposes exist side by side without much UNK conflict under present conditions STOP
START UNK economic and cultural opportunity STOP
START the broad expansion of free education results both in raising the average economic and cultural level of the society and in promoting UNK within the social structure STOP
START fifty years ago the general raising of the UNK age to sixteen was an example of this movement STOP
START during the past decade the program has been carried on through expansion of free higher education in state universities , state colleges , and community colleges STOP
START the UNK of american faith in the comprehensive high school , as expressed in the UNK study , is another indication of the UNK of the ideal of UNK opportunity through the UNK of educational opportunity STOP
START the recent federal UNK UNK program is another step in the direction of making higher education more available to UNK youth STOP
START it is probably more effective than the expanded scholarship programs of the past decade , because the scholarship programs mainly UNK the students with the best academic records ( who were usually middle-class ) , and these students tended to use the scholarship funds to go to more expensive colleges STOP
START meanwhile , the private colleges have increased their UNK rates so much that they have raised an economic UNK which UNK their scholarship funds STOP
START the UNK in educational opportunity during the past decade have taken place largely in the publicly supported institutions STOP
START unfortunately , however , and for reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely UNK as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues STOP
START and this fact may explain some of the UNK among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the UNK of total costs among different units of service STOP
START one such UNK , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the UNK of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs STOP
START here , the choice is that between the UNK of a dilemma STOP
START two major types of fully distributed cost analysis STOP
START 1 STOP
START the UNK type STOP
START despite an UNK due to its failure clearly to define `` relative costs '' , the above UNK of fully distributed UNK goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice STOP
START for more explicit UNK , one must distinguish different types of analyses STOP
START by all means the most important distinction is that between those UNK UNK which UNK a distribution of UNK UNK cost UNK on estimates of UNK or marginal costs , and those other UNK which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere UNK distribution STOP
START the first , or UNK , type might also be called the `` railroad type '' because of its application to UNK ( and other transportation agencies ) by the cost section of the UNK commerce commission STOP
START the cost section UNK between ( directly ) variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding chapter STOP
START the variable costs alone are assigned to the different units of freight traffic as representing `` UNK UNK costs '' -- a term with a meaning here not UNK different from that of the UNK `` UNK marginal costs '' STOP
START there remains a UNK of total costs , or total `` revenue requirements '' which , since it is found to UNK as if it were constant over substantial variations in traffic density , is strictly UNK on a UNK basis STOP
START nevertheless , because the cost section has felt UNK to make some kind of a distribution of total costs , it has UNK this UNK , which it sometimes calls `` burden '' , among the units of UNK traffic on a basis ( partly ton , partly UNK ) which is UNK quite arbitrary from the UNK of cost determination STOP
START in recent years , this burden ( which includes allowances for revenue UNK in the UNK business and in UNK freight traffic ! ! STOP
START ) has UNK to about one third of those total revenue requirements which the UNK freight business is supposed to be called upon to meet STOP
START since this book is concerned only UNK with railroad rates , it will not attempt to UNK the methods by which the staff of the UNK commerce commission has estimated UNK costs and UNK UNK costs STOP
START UNK it to say that the UNK of the latter UNK is UNK STOP
START but in any event , full credit should be given to the cost section for its express and UNK recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in UNK analyses : namely , that between a cost allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates of output of different classes of utility service ; ; STOP
START and a mere cost UNK which somehow UNK among the classes and units of service even those costs that are strictly UNK from the UNK of specific cost determination STOP
START 2 STOP
START the UNK type STOP
START we turn now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which , unlike the `` railroad type '' , draws no distinction between cost allocation and cost UNK : the UNK type STOP
START it might be called the `` public utility '' type because of the considerable use to which it has been put in gas and electric utility rate cases STOP
START here no attempt is made , first to determine UNK or marginal costs and then to UNK on these costs `` reasonably distributed '' UNK of total costs STOP
START instead , all of the total costs are treated as variable costs , although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be functions of different variables STOP
START moreover , whereas in UNK commerce commission UNK `` variable cost '' means a cost deemed to vary in direct proportion to changes in rate of output , in the type of analysis now under review `` variable cost '' has been used more UNK , so as to cover costs which , while a function of some one variable ( such as output of energy , or number of customers ) , are not necessarily a linear function STOP
START as already noted in an earlier UNK , the more familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes of service , such as residential , commercial , industrial power , street lighting , etc STOP
START this `` grand division '' permits many costs to be assigned in their UNK to some one class , such as street lighting , or at least to be UNK completely from some important class or classes STOP
START UNK industrial power service , for example , would not be charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of the UNK distribution lines STOP
START but the major UNK of the total costs of a utility business are common or joint to all , or nearly all , classes of customers ; ; STOP
START and these costs must somehow be UNK among the various classes and then must somehow be UNK among the units of service in order to report unit costs that can serve as UNK measures of reasonable rates STOP
START the general basis on which these common costs are assigned to UNK measured units of service will be illustrated by the following highly UNK problem of an UNK cost analysis STOP
START but before turning to this example , we must distinguish two UNK of analysis , both of which belong to the UNK type rather than to the UNK type STOP
START in the first UNK , the UNK ( following the practice of railroad analysis in this particular respect ) UNK both total operating costs and total annual capital costs ( including an allowance for `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return '' ) among the different classes and units of service STOP
START here , an UNK , say , of UNK of the total costs to residential service as a class would include an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential UNK STOP
START but in the second UNK , which i take to be the one more frequently applied , only the operating expenses and not the `` cost of capital '' or `` fair return '' are UNK directly among the various classes of service STOP
START to be sure , the capital UNK in ( or , UNK , the estimated `` fair values '' of ) the plant and equipment are UNK among the different classes , as are also the gross revenues received from the sales of the different services STOP
START but any resulting excess of revenues received from a given class of service over the operating costs UNK to this class is reported as a `` return '' realized on the capital investment attributed to the same service STOP
START thus , during any given year ( a ) if the revenues from the residential service are UNK , ( b ) if the operating expenses UNK to this class of service come to UNK , and ( c ) if the net investment in ( or value of ) the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this service amounts to UNK , the cost UNK will report that residential service , in the UNK , has UNK a return of UNK or UNK per cent STOP
START other services will show different rates of return , some probably much lower and some higher STOP
START there are obvious reasons of UNK for this practice of excluding `` cost of capital '' from the direct UNK of annual costs among the different classes of service -- notably , the UNK of the UNK question what rate of return should be held to constitute `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return '' STOP
START but the practice is likely to be UNK , since it may seem to support a conclusion that , as long as the revenues from any class of service cover the UNK operating expenses plus some return on capital investment , however low , the rates of charge for this service are UNK STOP
START UNK to say , any such UNK would be quite UNK STOP
START for the reason just suggested , i shall assume the use of the first UNK of fully distributed cost UNK in the following UNK example STOP
START that is to say , an allowance for `` cost of capital '' will be assumed to be included directly in the cost UNK STOP
START UNK analysis of the costs of an electric utility business STOP
START in order to UNK the UNK of a typical fully UNK cost analysis , let us assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company supplying a single city with power UNK by its own UNK plant STOP
START let us also assume the existence of only one class or type of service , all of which is supplied at the same voltage , phase , UNK residential , commercial , and industrial customers STOP
START this latter assumption will permit us to center attention on the most UNK aspect of modern public utility cost analysis -- the distinction among costs that are functions of UNK of the same service measured along different dimensions STOP
START since the company under review is supplying what we are here regarding as only one kind of service , we might suppose that the problem of total cost UNK would be very simple ; ; STOP
START indeed , that it would be limited to a finding of the total annual operating and capital costs of the business , followed by a calculation of this total in terms of annual cost per UNK of consumption STOP
START in fact , however , the problem is not so simple STOP
START for a statement of costs per UNK would ignore the fact that many of these costs are not a function of UNK output ( or consumption ) of energy STOP
START a recognition of multiple cost functions is therefore required STOP
START the UNK division , and the one most frequently used ( with UNK ) in gas and electric rate cases , is a UNK division of the total operating and capital costs into `` customer costs '' , `` energy '' or `` UNK costs '' , and `` demand '' or `` capacity '' costs STOP
START if this UNK division of costs were to have its UNK in the actual rates of charge for service , as it actually does have in some rates , there would result a UNK rate for any one class of service STOP
START for example , the monthly bill of a residential consumer might be the sum of a UNK customer charge , a UNK charge for UNK UNK of energy at STOP
START per UNK , and a UNK charge for a maximum demand of 2 UNK during the month at the rate of UNK per UNK -- a total bill of UNK for that month STOP
START but our present interest lies in the measurement of costs of service , and only indirectly in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these costs STOP
START let us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn , UNK that this UNK classification is used only for UNK purposes ; ; STOP
START costs actually vary in much more complex ways STOP
START 1 STOP
START the customer costs STOP
START these are those operating and capital costs found to vary with number of customers regardless , or almost regardless , of power consumption STOP
START included as a minimum are the costs of UNK and UNK along with whatever other expenses the company must UNK in taking on another consumer STOP
START these minimum costs may come to UNK per month , more or less , for residential and small commercial customers , although they are substantially higher for large industrial UNK , who require more UNK UNK and UNK devices STOP
START while costs on this order are sometimes UNK charged for in residential and commercial rates , in the form of a mere `` service charge '' , they are more frequently wholly or partly covered by a minimum charge which UNK the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no further payment STOP
START but the really UNK aspect of UNK UNK UNK because of the cost UNK frequent practice of including , not just those costs that can be UNK UNK as UNK for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary ( UNK ) distribution system -- a fraction equal to the estimated annual costs of a UNK system of minimum capacity STOP
START the UNK of sociology have remained largely UNK by the UNK STOP
START like primitive numbers in mathematics , the entire UNK UNK is taken to rest upon its operational worth STOP
START but what is the operational worth of a sociology which UNK UNK the idea of physical models ? ? STOP
START is it not the task of philosophy to see what UNK meaning can be assigned to the most sacred UNK in social science ? ? STOP
START it has become UNK clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by UNK mathematical and physical models , is itself a conditioned response to a world which UNK a UNK price for technological UNK STOP
START this push to UNK the study of mass UNK to the measurements of UNK involved in differential UNK has led sociology UNK close to the reduction of the word `` mass '' to mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals in such a group can be studied STOP
START ( UNK , 1959 : : STOP
START UNK STOP
START ) here i think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent STOP
START the simple UNK success of the sociology of small groups needs to be questioned STOP
START for if the small group notion involves the UNK claim that the phenomena of UNK investigations are of atomic or UNK proportions , the philosopher needs to know the extent to which such UNK are valid STOP
START the mere exploration of the unconscious ground of present-day sociology offers a rich vein of philosophical and logical investigation STOP
START ( UNK , 1959 : : STOP
START UNK STOP
START ) STOP
START a parallel function for philosophy is the study of the relation between UNK UNK received and UNK UNK formed STOP
START philosophy can supply adequate UNK of meaning in the selection of UNK UNK categories STOP
START this involves a UNK of the empirical and rational elements entering into each social science statement STOP
START UNK functional sociology may have great practical use in the study of different cultures , yet it is perfectly clear , as UNK ( 1957 : : STOP
START UNK - UNK ) and UNK ( 1959 : : STOP
START UNK - UNK ) indicate , that the concept of function in sociology has been built up from physiological and biological models , in which the notions of UNK , i.e, metaphysical purpose , are central STOP
START ( UNK 9 STOP
START ) UNK as a UNK UNK is , therefore , not a direct consequence of observations , but rather an indirect consequence of philosophical UNK and judgment STOP
START the purpose of this sort of philosophical study of sociology is not to UNK but to clarify the principles of social science STOP
START it is absurd to speak of philosophy as a superior enterprise to sociology , since the former is a logical , rational discipline , where sociology is essentially UNK and empirical STOP
START such a position UNK the UNK of philosophy in its UNK form as something UNK above and UNK the empirical and mathematical sciences STOP
START but contrary to UNK , philosophy is not a UNK for plato STOP
START the uses of philosophy as a logical UNK house are UNK to any approach that does not UNK to pure UNK STOP
START however , when philosophy attempts to stand above the sciences , to UNK the conditions of empirical research , it becomes formal metaphysics ; ; STOP
START UNK the contours of life to fit the needs of UNK STOP
START the notion of philosophy as queen UNK may fit well with UNK UNK of political UNK , but it has been noted that the price of such an UNK notion of philosophy is the UNK and UNK of the social sciences STOP
START ( UNK , 1952 : : STOP
START UNK , UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK STOP
START ) STOP
START metaphysics is no longer a direct UNK with nature as it was in UNK STOP
START it has UNK any claims of description in favor of psychological accounts of UNK , as in UNK system ( UNK ) STOP
START science is UNK for UNK to know nothing of nothing , in a last UNK effort to save the UNK at the expense of men STOP
START it is not UNK which has isolated metaphysics from reality by UNK between description and UNK STOP
START it is simply UNK the state to which metaphysical thinking has fallen during this century STOP
START consider the traditional `` four fields '' of philosophy : UNK , ethics , UNK and UNK STOP
START it is a commonplace that to the degree these special UNK of past UNK hunting grounds establish an empirical content and suitable UNK UNK , they move away from philosophy as such STOP
START what is left to traditional systems of philosophy is , in effect , only the history of these fields prior to their becoming UNK enough to UNK by the UNK of scientific method STOP
START in this situation , philosophy has UNK by UNK itself from metaphysics , by showing the ultimate questions to be the UNK questions STOP
START the UNK by philosophy of UNK claims to empirical UNK gives it an ability to treat problems of meaning and truth which in the past it was unable to examine because of its missionary attitude to knowledge of more humble UNK STOP
START in the new situation , philosophy is able to provide the social sciences with the same guidance that mathematics offers the physical sciences , a UNK of logical relations that can be used in UNK UNK having UNK and UNK value STOP
START beyond this , philosophy may urge the social sciences forward by asking the type of question that falls outside the present scope of social inquiry , but within its potential UNK of UNK STOP
START in this connection , it might be noted that the theory of games was a mathematical discovery long before its uses in political science were UNK STOP
START likewise , UNK formulated the UNK hypothesis , according to which the solar system was UNK from a rotating mass of UNK gas , nearly a half century before its scientific value was made plain by UNK in his UNK du UNK STOP
START this does not mean that philosophy UNK the problems it UNK , any more so than UNK UNK settled the physical status of the UNK UNK STOP
START but the UNK presentation of new issues for the sciences to work on is itself a UNK task STOP
START to those raised on UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK UNK , this may seem a UNK role for philosophy STOP
START however , UNK and UNK are different qualities STOP
START philosophy conceived of as servant to the sciences might appear as less dramatic than philosophy which UNK as the sciences UNK STOP
START the UNK effort to understand and measure the distance mankind has UNK since its primitive UNK status offers a more UNK sort of drama STOP
START by UNK fundamental UNK in the social sciences , and UNK the logical problems UNK at the UNK of each new scientific discipline , philosophy can offer the sort of distinction that can UNK growth in human understanding STOP
START philosophy can prevent the working UNK from becoming UNK and UNK by noting the assumptions and level at which a hypothesis or theory is UNK STOP
START the UNK of scientific theory , the examination of a theory from the UNK of language , UNK , and ethics , is itself a distinct contribution to knowledge , no less so because of its removal from empirical research STOP
START the realm of science , whatever the degree of precision in formulations , covers the range of UNK and explanation STOP
START ( UNK and UNK , 1948 : : STOP
START UNK - 75 STOP
START ) whatever philosophy is conceived to be , its UNK , UNK attitude to evidence should make it clear that it is something other than science STOP
START for some forms of philosophy , this very division between the empirical and the rational becomes a sign of the metaphysical UNK of the latter STOP
START UNK and UNK UNK that `` the secret is the center of a philosophy '' and thereafter a hundred UNK UNK UNK a higher UNK STOP
START this is simply a UNK of intellectual UNK UNK up to look UNK STOP
START for as UNK indicated ( 1953 ) , it is not the secret which is important , but the removal of UNK STOP
START in this , philosophy and science share a common goal STOP
START the UNK of the secret UNK UNK that the division of UNK and synthetic UNK shall not be overcome by even the most UNK argument ; ; STOP
START for this division is but an abstract representation of the social struggle between UNK and science STOP
START the UNK of metaphysical systems does not UNK the UNK of philosophy , only the close of a UNK age which demanded metaphysics to be rational and logical STOP
START the UNK with which present metaphysical attitudes UNK private intuition offers the strongest evidence that the UNK between scientific and UNK ways of UNK is built into the present conflict over the limits and purpose of science , religion and UNK STOP
START ( UNK : 1958 STOP
START ) scientific systems , and this includes even the relation of UNK to UNK physics , are built upon , UNK and UNK STOP
START UNK systems , by the very nature of their UNK , are UNK by UNK systems STOP
START in addition to the UNK of science and the UNK of metaphysics , they differ in that science is essentially UNK , while philosophy in its UNK forms , tends to be UNK , UNK and UNK STOP
START the UNK notion that belief , unlike UNK , is not subject to objective analysis , has placed UNK metaphysics UNK against the sociology of knowledge , since it is precisely the job of the sociology of knowledge to treat beliefs as social facts no less UNK than social UNK STOP
START when dealing with the actual relation of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge , or better the role of philosophy in UNK research on the social sources of ideas , one has to become necessarily selective STOP
START certain features we have UNK upon : philosophy as a logical , UNK system from which a social science UNK can be built up ; ; STOP
START UNK analysis of the assumptions and UNK of the social sciences ; ; STOP
START and philosophy as a guide to possible integration of UNK UNK UNK investigations STOP
START the objection will be raised that the most important role of philosophy in relation to social science has been UNK , namely the status of ultimate value questions and norms UNK in the social sciences STOP
START specifically , it will be asked whether the `` real '' questions people ask are not the `` ultimate '' questions that social science finds itself UNK in the face of STOP
START what then is the status of such questions as : is society the ground of human existence or a means to an individual goal ? ? STOP
START do societies develop according to cosmic patterns or are they subject only to the free choice of individuals ? ? STOP
START does society really exist as an UNK over and above the UNK of men ? ? STOP
START i think it must be said that , contrary to metaphysical UNK , these are questions so UNK as to UNK either empirical exploration or rational solutions STOP
START as UNK ( UNK ) and UNK ( UNK ) indicated , questions of whether the value of life is individual or social are not questions , but UNK of faith made to appear as legitimate questions STOP
START such UNK assume that answers of concrete significance can be supplied to statements involving UNK UNK STOP
START social theory has no more right to expect results from UNK questions , than physics has the right to expect a theological solution to the UNK controversy STOP
START it is not that such questions are not asked STOP
START it is rather that UNK them into social analysis reflects not so much a search for truth as for certainty STOP
START an operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract certainty , since it is certainty which every new discovery in science either UNK or UNK STOP
START to raise the added objection that men require certainty on psychological grounds , answers to ultimate questions having an UNK rather than scientific basis , is in a real sense to UNK the objection itself STOP
START for what concerns all scientific UNK is precisely that which can be captured for the rational , i.e, for the scientific determination of what in past ages was considered ultimate and UNK STOP
START a philosophy which attempts to supply ultimate answers in an ultimate way reveals its UNK in the UNK of men , an UNK with UNK , UNK solutions STOP
START men have always lived in a UNK world , and in UNK of ultimate judgments where and when necessary STOP
START uncertainty UNK itself is the UNK of the quest for new and more precise information about the world STOP
START without such uncertainty we are left with a set of UNK and UNK STOP
START the functional UNK of philosophy and science should , as a minimum , UNK a meaningful UNK to UNK STOP
START a degree of UNK is a UNK condition for the growth of science STOP
START but neither was the statement empirical , for UNK was not a quality like red or UNK that could be seen or heard STOP
START what were they to do , then , with these UNK judgments of value ? ? STOP
START to find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to UNK the theory UNK , and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery STOP
START it appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only STOP
START if it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at all , that they asserted nothing true or false , but merely expressed emotions like `` UNK '' or `` UNK '' , then these UNK judgments would cease from UNK and UNK heads could be at rest STOP
START this is the course the UNK took STOP
START they explained value judgments by UNK them away STOP
START now i do not think their view will do STOP
START but before discussing it , i should like to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they have stated their case STOP
START it has been said of john UNK UNK that he wrote so clearly that he could be found out STOP
START this theory has been put so clearly and precisely that it UNK criticism of the same kind , and this i will do my best to supply STOP
START the theory claims to show by analysis that when we say , `` that is good '' , we do not mean to assert a character of the subject of which we are thinking STOP
START i shall argue that we do mean to do just that STOP
START let us work through an example , and the simpler and UNK the better STOP
START there is perhaps no value statement on which people would more UNK agree than the statement that intense pain is bad STOP
START let us take a set of circumstances in which i happen to be interested on the legislative side and in which i think every one of us might naturally make such a statement STOP
START we come upon a UNK that has been caught in one of the UNK UNK in common use STOP
START there are signs that it has UNK for days to escape and that in a UNK of hunger , pain , and fear , it has all but UNK off its own leg STOP
START the attempt failed : the animal is now dead STOP
START as we think of the long and UNK pain it must have suffered , we are very likely to say : `` it was a bad thing that the little animal should suffer so '' STOP
START the UNK tells us that when we say this we are only expressing our present emotion STOP
START i hold , on the contrary , that we mean to assert something of the pain itself , namely , that it was bad -- bad when and as it occurred STOP
START consider what follows from the UNK view STOP
START on that view , nothing good or bad happened in the case until i came on the scene and made my remark STOP
START for what i express in my remark is something going on in me at the time , and that of course did not exist until i did come on the scene STOP
START the pain of the UNK was not itself bad ; ; STOP
START nothing evil was happening when that pain was being UNK ; ; STOP
START UNK , in the only sense in which it is involved at all , waited for its appearance till i came and looked and felt STOP
START now that this is at UNK with our meaning may be shown as follows STOP
START let us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the scene and that the UNK never was discovered STOP
START are we prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it did ? ? STOP
START clearly not STOP
START indeed , we should say , on the contrary , that the accident of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the UNK of the UNK pain , that it would have been every UNK as bad whether a chance UNK happened later to discover the body and feel UNK or not STOP
START if so , then it is clear that in saying the suffering was bad we are not expressing our feelings only STOP
START we are saying that the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an attitude toward it STOP
START the first argument is thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference STOP
START it UNK our present expression and shows that the UNK we meant would not be affected by this , whereas on UNK grounds it should be STOP
START the second argument applies the method in the reverse way STOP
START it UNK UNK the past event , and shows that this would UNK false what we mean to say , whereas on UNK grounds it should not STOP
START let us suppose that the animal did not in fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at all , but that we UNK believe it did , and say as before that its suffering was an evil thing STOP
START on the UNK theory , everything i sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second STOP
START in the only sense in which UNK is involved at all , whatever was bad in the first case is still present in its UNK , since all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling , and that feeling is still there STOP
START and our question is , is such an UNK consistent with what we meant ? ? STOP
START clearly it is not STOP
START if anyone asked us , after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing , whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all , we should say that it made all the difference in the world , that what we were UNK to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there , that if this had not occurred , there was nothing left to be bad , and that our UNK was in that case UNK STOP
START the suggestion that in saying something evil had occurred we were after all making no mistake , because we had never meant UNK to say anything about the past suffering , seems to me merely UNK STOP
START if we did not mean to say this , why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering had not occurred ? ? STOP
START on the theory before us , such relief would be UNK , for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at all , and hence in its UNK there would be nothing to be relieved about STOP
START the UNK theory would here UNK our meaning beyond recognition STOP
START so far as i can see , there is only one way out for the UNK STOP
START he holds that UNK and UNK lie in feelings of approval or disapproval STOP
START and there is a way in which he might hold that UNK did in this case UNK our own feeling of disapproval without UNK to the pain itself STOP
START the pain in itself was neutral ; ; STOP
START but unfortunately the UNK , on no grounds at all , took up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for the first time , and in the only UNK sense , bad STOP
START this way of escape is UNK possible , but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not , so far as i know , been urged by UNK , it is perhaps best not to spend time over it STOP
START i come now to a third argument , which again is very simple STOP
START when we come upon the UNK and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing , we presumably make it with some feeling ; ; STOP
START the UNK are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling STOP
START but suppose that a week later we UNK to the incident in thought and make our statement again STOP
START and suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that the feeling with which we made the remark in the first place has UNK STOP
START the UNK evidence is no longer before us ; ; STOP
START and we are now so UNK in body and mind that feeling is , as we say , quite dead STOP
START in these circumstances , since what was expressed by the remark when first made is , on the theory before us , simply absent , the remark now UNK nothing STOP
START it is as empty as the word `` UNK '' would be when there was no enthusiasm behind it STOP
START and this seems to me UNK STOP
START when we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing , the feeling with which we made it last week may be at or near the UNK point , but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before , we should certainly answer yes STOP
START we should say that we made our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time , but that it was the same point we were making STOP
START and if we can see that what we meant to say remains the same , while the feeling UNK from intensity to near zero , it is not the feeling that we primarily meant to express STOP
START i come now to a fourth consideration STOP
START we all believe that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting and another not ; ; STOP
START but on the theory before us such a belief would not make sense STOP
START broad and UNK have UNK contended that this UNK is one of the main facts of ethics , and i suspect they are right STOP
START but that is not exactly my point STOP
START my point is this : whether there is such UNK or not , we all assume that there is , and if we do , we express in moral judgments more than the UNK say we do STOP
START let me illustrate STOP
START in his novel the house of the dead , UNK tells of his experiences in a UNK prison camp STOP
START whatever the unhappy UNK of such camps are like today , UNK UNK were about as UNK a lot as can be UNK STOP
START `` i have heard stories '' , he writes , `` of the most terrible , the most UNK actions , of the most UNK UNK , told with the most spontaneous , UNK UNK UNK '' STOP
START most of us would say that in this delight at the UNK of others or the causing of suffering there is something very UNK STOP
START if we were asked why we thought so , we should say that these things involve great evil and are wrong , and that to take delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly UNK STOP
START now on the UNK view , this answer is ruled out STOP
START for before someone takes up an attitude toward death , suffering , or their UNK , they have no moral quality at all STOP
START there is therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or UNK could be fitting STOP
START they are in themselves neutral , and , so far as they get a moral quality , they get it only through being UNK with it by the attitude of the UNK STOP
START but if that is true , why is any attitude more fitting than any other ? ? STOP
START would UNK , for example , be fitting if , apart from the UNK , there were nothing good to UNK ? ? STOP
START would UNK be fitting if , independently of the UNK , there were nothing bad to UNK ? ? STOP
START in such a case , any attitude would be as fitting or UNK as any other , which means that the notion of UNK has lost all point STOP
START indeed , we are forced to go much farther STOP
START if UNK and UNK lie in attitudes only and hence are brought into being by them , those men who UNK death and misery with UNK UNK UNK are taking the only UNK line STOP
START if there is nothing evil in these things , if they get their moral UNK only from our feeling about them , why UNK they be UNK with a UNK ? ? STOP
START to UNK them with UNK would turn what before was neutral into something bad ; ; STOP
START it would UNK bring UNK into the world ; ; STOP
START and even on UNK assumptions that does not seem very bright STOP
START on the other hand , to UNK them with delight would UNK what before was neutral into something good ; ; STOP
START it would bring UNK into the world STOP
START the UNK german veteran was a former UNK , UNK years old , who had been wounded by UNK in the back of the head STOP
START this resulted in damage to the UNK UNK and very probably to the left side of the UNK also STOP
START in any event , the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became `` UNK blind '' , while at the same time , apparently , the sense of touch remained essentially UNK STOP
START UNK blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual UNK , a condition in which , for example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to UNK up a UNK of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence STOP
START this circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his UNK capacity remained basically in sound working order UNK its exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no UNK ( that is , UNK ) awareness UNK STOP
START the necessary UNK , as the authors themselves UNK it , would seem to be this : `` ( ( 1 ) UNK qualities are not among those UNK by the sense of touch , as such STOP
START we do not arrive at UNK images by means of the sense of touch by itself STOP
START ( 2 ) UNK becomes part of the UNK UNK only by way of visual UNK ; ; STOP
START that is , there is , in the true sense , only a visual space '' STOP
START the underlying assumption , of course , is that only sight and touch enable us , in any precise and fully UNK way , to locate objects in space beyond us , the other UNK being UNK UNK , if not UNK inadequate , in this regard STOP
START this is an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel STOP
START therefore , if the sense of touch is UNK normally and there is a complete absence of UNK awareness in a UNK person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled , the conclusion seems UNK that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the UNK of things and that actual sight or visual UNK are necessary STOP
START the force of the UNK analysis ( if indeed it has any force ) can be felt by the reader , i believe , only after three questions have been successfully answered STOP
START ( 1 ) what allows us to think that the patient had no UNK UNK when his eyes were closed ? ? STOP
START ( 2 ) what evidence is there that he was UNK blind ? ? STOP
START ( 3 ) how can we be sure that his sense of touch was not UNK disturbed by his head injury ? ? STOP
START we shall consider these in the UNK order of their presentation STOP
START obviously , a satisfactory answer to the third question is UNK , if the argument is to get under way at all , for if there is any possibility of doubt whether the patient's UNK sensitivity had been UNK by the UNK UNK , any findings UNK in regard to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether , of course , as evidence to establish the desired conclusion STOP
START the answer the authors give to it , therefore , is of supreme importance STOP
START it is as follows : `` the usual sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of UNK ( pressure , pain , temperature ) , as well as the UNK UNK ( UNK feelings , feelings in the UNK and UNK ) , were , as such , essentially UNK , although they seemed , in comparison with normal reactions , to be somewhat UNK over the entire body STOP
START the supposed UNK sense of UNK location and orientation in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member , as well as the direction and scope of a movement , UNK UNK ( with one of his members ) , proved to have been , on the contrary , very considerably affected '' STOP
START the authors insist , however , that these UNK in the sense of touch were due absolutely to no organic UNK in that sense faculty but rather to the UNK which the patient had sustained to the sense of sight STOP
START first of all , what is their evidence that the UNK apparatus was UNK UNK ? ? STOP
START ( 1 ) when an object was placed in the patient's hand , he had no difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold , sharp or UNK , rough or smooth , flexible , soft , or hard ; ; STOP
START and he could tell , simply by the feel of it , whether it was made of wood , iron , cloth , UNK , and so on STOP
START and he could recognize , by touch alone , articles which he had handled immediately before , even though they were altogether UNK to him and could not be identified by him ; ; STOP
START that is , he was UNK what kind of objects they were or what their use was STOP
START ( 2 ) the patient UNK an UNK efficiency in a new trade STOP
START because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line of work , that of a UNK , an occupation requiring a great deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly UNK sense of form and UNK STOP
START it seems clear , when one takes into consideration the UNK UNK UNK of the patient ( we shall describe it in detail in connection with our second question , the one concerning the UNK blindness of the patient ) , that he had to UNK on his sense of touch much more than the usual UNK and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision STOP
START and so the authors conclude : `` the conduct of the patient in his UNK life and in his work , even more than the UNK facts ( mentioned above under 1 ) , leave UNK no room for doubt that the sense of touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was UNK ; ; STOP
START or , to put the same thing in physiological terms , that the UNK of the UNK apparatus , from the UNK up to the UNK centers in the brain , -- that is , from one end to the other -- was UNK '' STOP
START if the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point , it remains for us to consider whether the patient's difficulties in UNK himself UNK and in locating objects in space with the sense of touch can be explained by his UNK visual condition STOP
START but before we can do this , we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2 ; ; STOP
START then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at hand STOP
START in what ways , then , did the patient's UNK blindness UNK itself ? ? STOP
START he could not see objects as UNK , UNK , and organized figures , as a person does with normal vision STOP
START the meaning of this , as we shall see , is that he had no fund of visual UNK of objects as objects ; ; STOP
START and , therefore , he could not recognize even UNK things upon seeing them again STOP
START instead , he constantly became lost in parts and components of them , confused some of their details with those of neighboring objects , and so on , unless he allowed time to `` trace '' the object in question through minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover its contours STOP
START according to his own testimony , he never actually saw things as shaped but only as generally UNK `` UNK '' of color of a more or less UNK size ; ; STOP
START at their edges they UNK pretty much out of focus altogether STOP
START but by the tracing procedure , he could , in a strange obviously UNK manner , find the UNK form ; ; STOP
START could piece , as it were , the UNK mass together into an organized whole and then recognize it as a man or a UNK or whatever it turned out to be STOP
START if , however , the figure to be UNK were complicated , composed of several UNK UNK , and so on , even the tracing process failed him , and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes among its parts STOP
START this meant , UNK , that the patient could not read at all without making UNK movements of the head or body , became easily confused by `` UNK marks '' inserted between UNK words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters , and could recognize a simple straight line or a UNK one only by tracing it STOP
START the patient himself denied that he had any visual UNK at all ; ; STOP
START and there was ample evidence of the following sort to UNK him STOP
START after a conversation with another man , he was able to UNK practically everything that had been said but could not describe at all what the other man looked like STOP
START nor could he call up UNK of close friends or relatives STOP
START in short , both his own UNK and his UNK blindness , when he looked at objects , seem to present UNK evidence that he had simply no visual memory at all STOP
START he was UNK of the form of the object actually being viewed , precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape , already learned and held in visual memory , as persons of normal vision do STOP
START he could not recognize it ; ; STOP
START he was absolutely UNK with it because he had no visual memory at all STOP
START therefore , his only UNK was to learn the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same individual object or type of object ; ; STOP
START and this he could do only by going over its mass with the tracing procedure STOP
START then he might finally recognize it , apparently by UNK the visual UNK , actually being seen , with UNK feelings in the head or body accompanying the tracing movements STOP
START this would mean , it can readily be seen , that , again , for each new visual experience , the tracing UNK would have to be repeated because of the absence of visual UNK STOP
START as one would UNK , the procedure , however , could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough , so that the corresponding visual UNK and the UNK beginning of the tracing movement would provide UNK as to the actual shape , which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of UNK STOP
START men , trees , automobiles , houses , and so on -- objects continually confronted in UNK life -- had each its characteristic UNK and became easily UNK , at the very beginning of tracing , by an UNK as to what each was STOP
START UNK , for example , he UNK from black UNK on a white surface STOP
START he evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects , but their size and the UNK gave them away STOP
START and the authors give numerous instances of calculated UNK on the patient's part to show how large a role it played in his process of UNK himself and how UNK he became at it STOP
START often he seems even to have been able to UNK correctly , without the tracing UNK , solely on the basis of UNK differences among the UNK things which appeared in his visual experience STOP
START perhaps the very important question -- what is , then , exactly the role of UNK UNK in the patient's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing movements when he is actually looking at things ? ? STOP
START -- has now been raised in the UNK mind and in the following form STOP
START if the patient can perceive figure UNK when he cannot perceive it UNK , then , it would seem , the sense of touch has immediate contact with the UNK aspects of things in independence of visual UNK , at least in regard to two dimensions , and , as we shall see , even this much UNK awareness on the part of UNK touch is denied by the authors STOP
START how , then , do the UNK UNK function in all this ? ? STOP
START the authors set about UNK this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient's ability , UNK , ( 1 ) to perceive figure and ( 2 ) to locate objects in space , with his eyes closed ( or turned away from the object concerned ) STOP
START quite naturally , they make the investigation , first , by UNK the patient from making any movements at all and then , later , by UNK it and allowing the patient to move in any way he wanted to STOP
START when the patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at all , the following striking results occurred STOP
START whenever artists , indeed , turned to actual UNK or molded UNK figures , which were rare down to 800 UNK they tended to reflect reality ( see UNK UNK , UNK ) ; ; STOP
START a UNK , abstract treatment of men and animals , by UNK , rose only in the late eighth century STOP
START to speak of this underlying view of the world is to UNK upon matters of subjective judgment STOP
START at the least , however , one may conclude that geometric UNK UNK a logical order ; ; STOP
START their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the homeric UNK and the UNK line STOP
START their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the UNK of life STOP
START and perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in UNK that the outlook of their makers and UNK was basically stable and secure STOP
START the UNK of the past had died away , and the great UNK which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to UNK UNK minds STOP
START throughout the work of the later UNK century a calm , severe UNK displays itself STOP
START in the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or UNK one in its internal UNK , but the best of the geometric UNK have UNK been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the greek world STOP
START the UNK century was in its artistic work `` the UNK UNK and most UNK between past and future '' , and the UNK skill spent by its artists upon their products is a UNK to their sense that what they were doing was important and was UNK STOP
START the aegean in 800 UNK STOP
START geometric pottery has not yet received the thorough , detailed study which it UNK , partly because the task is a UNK one and partly because some of its local UNK , as at UNK , are only now coming to light STOP
START from even a UNK inspection of its many aspects , however , the historian can UNK several fundamental conclusions about the progress of the aegean world down to 800 UNK STOP
START STOP
START the general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the UNK century was now UNK to a significant degree STOP
START much which was in UNK in UNK had become reasonably well developed by 800 STOP
START in this process the UNK UNK had been UNK or finally rejected ; ; STOP
START the aegean world which had existed before UNK UNK from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800 STOP
START those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of aegean development from earliest times -- granted occasional UNK of peoples and ideas from outside -- are correct ; ; STOP
START but all too many observers have been UNK by this fact into UNK the degree of change which took place in the early first UNK STOP
START the focus of UNK in this world now lay in the UNK districts of the greek UNK , and by 800 virtually the entire aegean , always UNK its northern UNK , had accepted the geometric style of pottery STOP
START while UNK vases usually turn up , especially outside greece proper , together with as many or more examples of local UNK , these `` UNK '' patterns had mostly UNK by the later UNK century STOP
START in their place came local variations within the common style -- UNK , as it were , in UNK products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the geometric spirit developed STOP
START UNK , though important , was not the only teacher of this age STOP
START one can take a UNK of about 800 UNK , without any knowledge of its place of origin , venture to assign it to a specific area ; ; STOP
START imitation and UNK of UNK now become UNK STOP
START the UNK of the aegean islands thus stood apart from those of the UNK , and in greece itself UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , and other geometric UNK have each their own UNK STOP
START these local variations were to become ever UNK in the next century and a half STOP
START the same conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the dark ages , from UNK distribution , and from the UNK of early social , political , and religious patterns into later ages STOP
START by 800 UNK aegean was an area of common tongue and of common culture STOP
START on these UNK UNK that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be UNK in the remarkably unlimited UNK of the iliad STOP
START everywhere within the common pattern , however , one finds local diversity ; ; STOP
START greek history and culture were UNK UNK , and UNK , by the UNK of these UNK yet opposed factors STOP
START further we cannot go , for the dark ages UNK their name STOP
START many aspects of civilization were not yet sufficiently UNK to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a UNK structure STOP
START the epic poems , the UNK of the greek UNK , the rise of firm political units , the UNK which could permit painted and UNK UNK of men -- all these had to UNK the progress of following decades STOP
START what we have seen in this chapter , we have seen only UNK , and yet the results , however general , are worth the search STOP
START these are the centuries in which the UNK of the aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the UNK outlook , independent of outside forces STOP
START to UNK , indeed , the era from UNK to 800 as a period mainly of UNK may be a necessary but unfortunate UNK born of our lack of detailed information ; ; STOP
START if we could see more deeply , we probably would find many side issues and wrong UNK which came to an end within the period STOP
START the historian can only point out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence , and must hope that future UNK will UNK our understanding STOP
START throughout the dark ages , it is clear , the greek world had been developing slowly but consistently STOP
START the pace could now be UNK , for the UNK of the aegean stood on firm ground STOP
START chapter 5 the early eighth century STOP

START the first UNK UNK of the new day cannot yet UNK all the dark UNK which lie across the aegean world ; ; STOP
START but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more UNK some of the lines of change STOP
START for this period , as for earlier centuries , pottery remains the most secure source ; ; STOP
START the UNK material of the age is more UNK , more UNK , and more UNK of the hopes and fears of its makers , who begin to show scenes of human life and death STOP
START UNK and simple UNK UNK the UNK of UNK and UNK in greece ; ; STOP
START objects in gold , UNK , and UNK grow more numerous STOP
START since writing was UNK in the aegean before the end of the century , we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful STOP
START though it is not easy to apply the evidence of the iliad to any specific era , this UNK product of the epic tradition had certainly taken UNK shape by UNK STOP
START the UNK geometric pottery of UNK and the iliad are amazing UNK of the inherent UNK of greek civilization ; ; STOP
START but both were among the last products of a phase which was ending STOP
START greek civilization was UNK toward its great revolution , in which the developed qualities of the UNK outlook were suddenly to break forth STOP
START the revolution was well under way before UNK UNK and UNK signs go back virtually across the century STOP
START the era , however , is UNK STOP
START while many UNK point forward , the main achievements stand as a UNK of the simple patterns of the dark ages STOP
START the dominant pottery of the century was geometric ; ; STOP
START political organization UNK about the UNK ; ; STOP
START trade was just beginning to UNK ; ; STOP
START the UNK who protected the greek UNK were only now putting on their sharply UNK dress STOP
START the modern student , who knows what was to come next , is likely to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth century STOP
START not all men of the period would have accepted this emphasis STOP
START many UNK UNK to the past the more UNK as they were confronted with UNK new ideas ; ; STOP
START the poet of the iliad deliberately UNK STOP
START although it is not possible to UNK old and new in this era , i shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decades of the eighth century and shall UNK them as an UNK of the first stage of greek civilization STOP
START on this principle of division i must UNK the evolution of UNK , UNK , society , and politics ; ; STOP
START for the developments in these areas make sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself STOP
START the growing contacts between aegean and UNK are also a phase which should be linked primarily to the remarkable UNK of UNK culture after UNK STOP
START we shall not be able entirely to pass over these UNK to the east as we consider UNK geometric pottery , the epic and the myth , and the religious evolution of early greece ; ; STOP
START the important point , however , is that these magnificent achievements , unlike those of later decades , were only UNK influenced by UNK models STOP
START the UNK of UNK vases and of the iliad lie in the aegean past STOP
START UNK pottery STOP
START the pottery of the first half of the eighth century is commonly called UNK geometric STOP
START the severe yet UNK vases of the previous fifty years , the strong geometric style of the late UNK century , display as firm a UNK of the principles underlying geometric pottery ; ; STOP
START but artists now were ready to UNK and elaborate their UNK STOP
START the vases which resulted had different shapes , far more complex UNK , and a larger sense of style STOP
START beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader lines STOP
START in earlier centuries men had had enough to do in UNK a fundamental sense of order after chaos STOP
START they had had to work on very simple foundations and had not UNK to give UNK to UNK STOP
START the UNK , in particular , had virtually UNK UNK drawing , elaborate UNK , and the UNK lines of nature , while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe STOP
START in their vases were UNK the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of greek civilization , at first UNK in UNK work , and then more UNK in the initial stages of the geometric style STOP
START by 800 social and cultural security had been achieved , at least on a simple plane ; ; STOP
START it was time to take bigger steps , to venture on experiments STOP
START UNK geometric UNK continued to UNK the old UNK of UNK and shapes and made use of the UNK though limited range of UNK which they had UNK STOP
START in these respects the vases of the early eighth century represent a UNK of earlier lines of progress STOP
START to the UNK UNK , however , new materials were added STOP
START UNK left less and less of a UNK in a plain dark color ; ; STOP
START instead they divided the surface into many UNK or covered it by UNK patterns into which UNK drawing began to UNK STOP
START UNK lines , UNK patterns , UNK of UNK UNK nature , birds either UNK or in UNK rows , animals in UNK frieze UNK ( see plates 11 - 12 ) -- all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary signs that the UNK were UNK their UNK STOP
START the rows of animals and birds , in particular , suggest awareness of UNK animal UNK , UNK perhaps via UNK silver UNK and UNK , but the specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are UNK greek STOP
START though the spread of this type of UNK in the aegean has not yet been precisely determined , it seems to appear first in the UNK , which were among the leading UNK of pottery throughout the century STOP
START as the material at the command of the UNK grew and the volume of their production increased , the local variations within a common style became more evident STOP
START UNK 12 UNK four examples , which are UNK or late geometric work of common spirit but of different schools STOP
START cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and , when he could not show the UNK , UNK him STOP

START three weeks later , following his recovery , armed with a UNK issued by the UNK justice on UNK prepared by the district attorney , cook and UNK rode to UNK UNK STOP
START arriving at UNK , they found UNK in his UNK and demanded that he surrender STOP
START instead , he UNK and ran to his house for a gun , UNK them to kill him , cook reported STOP
START both UNK and UNK lives were threatened by the mexicans following the UNK , but the company officers felt that in the end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion STOP
START general manager UNK even suggested that it might be wise to keep the mexicans in UNK rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away , and try to have a few UNK STOP
START on february 17 , UNK and cook were sent to the UNK UNK community on the UNK to see about UNK out UNK the company had purchased STOP
START while talking with UNK UNK , francisco UNK and UNK UNK appeared , both heavily armed , and after watching the house for a while , rode away STOP

START indeed , it is even surprising in the UNK of christ church and UNK professor of UNK history , who UNK this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant professor of medieval and renaissance english at cambridge , who UNK it and is now its most UNK UNK STOP
START but to return to the main line of our inquiry , it is doubtful that utopia is still widely read because more was medieval or even because he was a UNK -- indeed , it is likely that these days many who read utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a UNK STOP
START utopia is still widely read because in a sense more stood on the UNK of UNK STOP
START and if he did stand on the UNK of UNK , it was not in UNK a UNK for such unity as UNK UNK might be able to force on western UNK STOP
START it was not even in writing latin UNK , sometimes UNK ones , or in UNK UNK from greek into latin or in UNK the study of greek against the attack of conservative UNK , or in UNK the conservative UNK who opposed UNK UNK study of the new testament STOP
START similar literary exercises were the common UNK of a christian UNK of the first two decades of the UNK century STOP
START had UNK writings been wholly limited to such exercises , they would be almost as UNK remembered as those of a dozen or so other authors living in his time , whose works UNK survive in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in UNK of their very specialized occasions read those works STOP
START more stands on the UNK of UNK for one reason alone -- because he wrote utopia STOP
START and the evidence that he does , indeed , stand there UNK quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather UNK readers have responded to that book for the past century or so STOP
START only one other contemporary of UNK UNK so immediate and direct a response , and only one other contemporary work -- UNK UNK and the prince STOP
START can we discover what it is in utopia that has UNK this response ? ? STOP
START remember that in seeking the modern in utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the renaissance there ; ; STOP
START we do not even need to UNK ourselves to UNK on the same UNK scale the relative importance of the medieval , the renaissance , and the modern STOP
START the medieval was the most important to UNK because he sought to place thomas more , the author of utopia , in some UNK relation with UNK more , the UNK STOP
START to others whose concern it is to UNK the significance of christian UNK , the renaissance elements are of primary concern STOP
START but here we have a UNK modern UNK ; ; STOP
START we want to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has ; ; STOP
START we want to know what is UNK new about utopia STOP
START what is new about it ? ? STOP
START to that question the answer is simple ; ; STOP
START it can be made in two words , utopian communism STOP
START but it is an answer which UNK the door wide to an UNK of UNK and UNK STOP
START surely there is nothing new about communism STOP
START we find it in plato's republic , and in utopia more UNK his UNK to that book STOP
START we find it in that `` common way of life UNK to christ and still in use among the UNK societies of christians '' , that is , the better UNK which made it easier to UNK the UNK to christianity STOP
START we find it in the later UNK conception of man's natural condition which included the community of all UNK STOP
START this conception was taken up by the early church fathers and by UNK lawyers and UNK in the middle ages ; ; STOP
START and more was far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it STOP
START but although the idea of communism is very old even in UNK day and did not spring UNK from his imagination in UNK , it is not communism as such that we are concerned with STOP
START we are concerned not with the UNK communism nor with other species of the UNK : UNK , UNK , early christian , UNK , UNK or theological communism ; ; STOP
START we are concerned with utopian communism -- that is , simply communism as it appears in the imaginary UNK of utopia , as more conceived it STOP
START perhaps one way to UNK our sense of the UNK of utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier types of UNK theory STOP
START we will achieve a more vivid sense of what it is by UNK what it is not STOP
START in plato's republic communism is -- to speak UNK -- a communism of UNK STOP
START its function is to separate from the base ruled mass , among whom private ownership UNK , the governing UNK UNK STOP
START moreover , it is too readily forgotten that in the republic what gave the initial UNK to plato's UNK into the construction of an imaginary UNK with its UNK communism of goods , wives , and children , was his quest for a UNK for the proper ordering of the individual human UNK ; ; STOP
START and it is to this problem that the republic ultimately returns STOP
START in UNK utopia communism is not a means of UNK out a UNK UNK from the UNK mass STOP
START utopian communism applies to all UNK STOP
START and in the economy of the book it is not UNK but central STOP
START the concern of utopia is with the UNK UNK UNK , the best ordering of a civil society ; ; STOP
START and it is again and again made clear that utopian communism provides the UNK UNK UNK to that best ordering STOP
START to derive utopian communism from the UNK christian community of the UNK age or from its medieval UNK , the UNK communities , is with an appropriate shift of UNK , UNK in the same way as to derive it from plato's republic : in the republic we have to do with an UNK of physical and intellectual UNK , in the UNK and UNK communities with an UNK of spiritual and religious UNK STOP
START the UNK community was literally an UNK : chosen by christ himself STOP
START and the UNK communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only after a UNK which would test their religious UNK for UNK UNK , their spiritual UNK STOP
START finally , the conception of the natural community of all UNK which UNK with the UNK was firmly fixed in a tradition by UNK time , although it was not accepted by all the UNK of the middle ages STOP
START in that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the fall of man STOP
START it did not serve to contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order , because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man had UNK STOP
START the actual function of UNK communism was adequately set forth by UNK almost a UNK before more wrote utopia STOP
START `` the soil is common to all men STOP
START when we give the necessities of life to the poor , we UNK to them what is already theirs STOP
START we should think of it more as an act of justice than UNK '' STOP
START because community not UNK of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely UNK right to what is his STOP
START indeed , of all that is his every man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience UNK to regard himself as a UNK STOP
START he is a UNK for the common good , however UNK the UNK which the positive or municipal law of property provides against his UNK of that share of the common fund , UNK or UNK , UNK to his keeping STOP
START in contrast to this UNK view , utopia implies that the nature of man is such that to UNK on individual conscience to supply the UNK of municipal law is to UNK on the UNK sea of human UNK in a UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK conscience with legal UNK STOP
START in a properly ordered society the massive force of public law UNK the function which in natural law theory UNK is left altogether to a small voice so often still STOP
START in all the respects just indicated utopian communism UNK from previous UNK in which community of UNK and living plays a role STOP
START neither from one of these UNK nor from a combination of them can it be UNK STOP
START we do not deny UNK to the UNK because UNK found the tales of the house of UNK among the folk UNK of the UNK STOP
START in a like sense whatever UNK or UNK of previous UNK one may find in it , utopian communism remains , as an integral whole , original -- a new thing STOP
START it is not merely a new thing ; ; STOP
START it is one of the very few new things in utopia ; ; STOP
START most of the rest is medieval or UNK or part of an old tradition of social criticism STOP
START but to say that at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern ; ; STOP
START and for this statement the best evidence comes within the five years following the publication of utopia , when UNK UNK UNK a new perception of the nature of the UNK encounter with man STOP
START new , indeed , is UNK perception , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make UNK to modern students what UNK was getting at STOP
START although utopian communism is both new in UNK and also modern , it is not modern communism or even modern socialism , as they exist or have ever existed in theory or in practice STOP
START consider the features of utopian communism : generous public provision for the UNK ; ; STOP
START democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests , meals taken publicly in common UNK ; ; STOP
START a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens ; ; STOP
START even houses changed once a decade ; ; STOP
START six hours of UNK labor a day for all but a UNK of UNK and scholars , and careful measures to prevent anyone from UNK ; ; STOP
START no private property , no money ; ; STOP
START no sort of UNK at all for any goods or services , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term STOP
START whatever the UNK of its UNK , utopian communism is far too naive , far too UNK , to suit any modern socialist or communist STOP
START it is not the details of utopian communism that make utopia modern , it is the spirit , the attitude of mind that UNK those details STOP
START what that spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it UNK with the communist tradition with the UNK continuous history , the one which reached christianity by the way of UNK through the church fathers of late UNK STOP
START during the UNK trial the democratic press condemned the proceedings and UNK UNK as a UNK to the principles of the declaration of independence STOP
START during the brown trial , however , the state's most powerful democratic newspaper , the providence daily post , stated that brown was a UNK , a man of blood , and that he and his UNK , with the assistance of UNK and UNK , had UNK not only the UNK of the slaves but also the UNK of state and federal governments STOP
START the providence daily journal answered the daily post by stating that the UNK of john brown was characteristic of democratic acts of violence and that `` he was acting in direct opposition to the republican party , who UNK as one of their UNK principles that they do not UNK with slavery in the states '' STOP
START the two major newspapers in providence continued , throughout the crisis , to UNK each other of UNK the facts and attempting to UNK history STOP
START while the daily post continued to UNK UNK and the daily journal continued to UNK democrats , the UNK UNK complained that the virginia authorities showed UNK and UNK UNK to UNK brown and his men STOP
START editor UNK stated , `` of their guilt there can be no doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial '' STOP
START the providence daily post thought that there were probably good reasons for the UNK in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be UNK feelings STOP
START the providence daily journal stated that although the guilt of brown was evident , the south must UNK him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace STOP
START on october 31 , UNK , john brown was found guilty of UNK against the state of virginia , UNK slave UNK , and murder STOP
START for these UNK he was UNK to be UNK in public on friday , december 2 , UNK STOP

START on UNK morning , november 2 , UNK , the providence daily journal stated that although brown UNK UNK the extreme UNK , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the UNK without a fair trial STOP
START the UNK main criticism of the trial was the UNK with which it was conducted STOP
START the readers of the providence daily post , however , learned that it was generally UNK that `` old brown '' had a fair trial STOP
START concerning the sentence the editor asked , `` what else can virginia do than to UNK the men who have UNK her laws , organized UNK , and UNK her citizens '' STOP
START in the eastern section of the state the UNK reaction to brown's trial and sentence were basically identical STOP
START UNK smith , editor of the UNK telegraph stated that `` the ends of justice must be satisfied , a UNK example must be set , in order that all those UNK UNK , who , UNK by a blind UNK , dare to UNK UNK , UNK , and murder , may UNK it and shape their future course accordingly '' STOP
START the editor of the newport UNK could discover no evidence of UNK circumstances in the brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the UNK of capital punishment STOP
START in direct contrast to the other rhode island editors , samuel UNK of the UNK UNK UNK condemned the trial as being completely UNK STOP
START concerning the sentence , UNK wrote , `` if it be possible that mercy shall UNK UNK and that john brown's sentence shall be UNK to UNK , it would be well -- well for the country and for virginia '' STOP
START despite the excitement being caused by the trial and sentence of john brown , rhode UNK turned their attention to the state elections STOP
START the state had elected republican candidates in the past two years STOP
START there was no doubt as to the control the republican party exercised throughout the state STOP
START if it failed on occasion to UNK its candidates for general state offices by UNK , the failure was due to a UNK UNK of the UNK party , which called itself the american republican party STOP
START the american UNK and the UNK both UNK UNK UNK for governor STOP
START UNK UNK was the democratic UNK STOP
START the results of the election of UNK found republican candidates not only winning the offices of governor and UNK but also UNK the two UNK offices from the eastern and western sections of the state STOP

START whereas , john brown has UNK UNK his life in UNK to deliver those who are denied all rights and is this day UNK to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no UNK : therefore , STOP
START resolved that , while we most UNK UNK the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects , yet in his UNK to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom , we still recognize the qualities of a UNK nature and the exercise of a spirit which true men have always UNK and which history never UNK to honor STOP
START resolved that his UNK and UNK in kansas , UNK by the violence and UNK of those who were UNK on the UNK of slavery in that territory , call for a UNK judgment upon his recent efforts in virginia to UNK the UNK from which he had suffered , and UNK his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who UNK suffering and UNK justice STOP
START resolved that the anti-slavery sentiment is becoming UNK for UNK action STOP
START resolved , that we find in this UNK tragedy at UNK UNK a reason for more earnest effort to remove the evil of slavery from the whole land as UNK as possible STOP
START on the morning following the UNK hall meeting the editor of the providence daily journal wrote that although the meeting was UNK and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes , it could have been avoided completely STOP
START rather than being UNK , the eye is UNK ; ; STOP
START instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture STOP
START through UNK and 1912 , as the UNK UNK tendency to UNK to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at UNK length fell all the more to UNK UNK STOP
START to UNK , and sometimes to replace , the UNK UNK , UNK and picasso began to UNK sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; STOP
START the UNK UNK thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas STOP
START in certain other pictures , however , UNK began to paint areas in exact UNK of wood UNK or UNK STOP
START these areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the UNK printing into a depth from which it could be UNK -- and set to UNK again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; STOP
START that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms UNK within the illusion that these forms left no room for the UNK except near the surface STOP
START the UNK of such devices , however , soon had the effect of UNK , even while UNK , surface and depth STOP
START the process of UNK seemed UNK , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from UNK with the illusion STOP
START it was for this reason , and no other that i can see , that in september 1912 , UNK took the radical and revolutionary step of UNK actual pieces of UNK UNK to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to UNK its UNK in paint STOP
START picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of UNK , when he glued a piece of UNK UNK to a painting on UNK STOP
START it is true that his first collage looks more UNK than UNK , which would confirm the date he UNK it STOP
START but it is also true that UNK was the consistent pioneer in the use of UNK UNK as well as of UNK ; ; STOP
START and moreover , he had already begun to UNK and UNK the UNK of UNK cubism as far back as the end of 1910 STOP
START when we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each STOP
START ( it makes no real difference that UNK collage is on paper and UNK out in UNK , while UNK is on UNK and UNK out in oil STOP
START ) by its greater UNK presence and its greater UNK , the affixed paper or cloth serves for a UNK moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the UNK printing or UNK UNK had ever done STOP
START but here again , the UNK device both UNK and falls short of its aim STOP
START for the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in UNK , which gives way in turn , and with equal UNK , to an illusion that seems to contain both -- or neither STOP
START because of the size of the areas it covers , the UNK paper UNK UNK UNK UNK , as more than an indication or sign STOP
START literal UNK now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture , and the device UNK : the illusion of depth is rendered even more UNK than before STOP
START instead of UNK the literal UNK by UNK and UNK it , the UNK paper or cloth UNK and UNK it , and the artist seems to have nothing left but this UNK UNK with which to finish as well as start his picture STOP
START the actual surface becomes both ground and background , and it turns out -- suddenly and UNK -- that the only place left for a UNK illusion is in front of , upon , the surface STOP
START in their very first UNK , UNK and picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth , so that certain of the principal features of their subjects as UNK seem to UNK out into real , UNK space -- or to be about to do so -- while the rest of the subject remains UNK in , or flat upon , the surface STOP
START and the surface is driven back , in its very UNK , only by this contrast STOP
START in the upper center of UNK first collage , fruit UNK ( in UNK UNK collection ) , a UNK of UNK is rendered with such UNK vivid UNK effect as to UNK it practically off the picture plane STOP
START the UNK illusion here is no longer UNK between parallel UNK , but seems to UNK through the surface of the drawing paper and establish depth on top of it STOP
START yet the violent UNK of the UNK strips UNK to the paper , and the only lesser UNK of block UNK that UNK window UNK , manage somehow to push the UNK UNK back into place on the picture plane so that it does not `` UNK '' STOP
START at the same time , the UNK strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and UNK of UNK UNK upon them , and by their placing in relation to the block UNK ; ; STOP
START and these UNK seem in turn to be pushed back by their placing , and by contrast with the UNK of the UNK STOP
START thus every part and plane of the picture UNK changing place in relative depth with every other part and plane ; ; STOP
START and it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts of the picture is the UNK and ambiguous one that each has with the surface STOP
START and the same thing , more or less , can be said of the UNK of UNK first collage STOP
START in later UNK of both UNK , a variety of UNK materials are used , sometimes in the same work , and almost always in conjunction with every other UNK and UNK device they can think of STOP
START the area UNK to one edge of a piece of affixed material -- or simply of a UNK form -- will be UNK to UNK that edge away from the surface , while something will be drawn , painted or even UNK over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth STOP
START planes defined as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space , and a depth is suggested UNK which is greater than that established UNK STOP
START all this UNK the UNK between surface and depth so as to UNK UNK space in front of the surface as well as behind it STOP
START UNK may now UNK everything , but it is a UNK become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself -- at least an optical if not , properly speaking , a UNK illusion STOP
START UNK , UNK UNK is now almost completely UNK to the literal , UNK kind , but at the same time it UNK upon and largely UNK the UNK kind -- and it does so , moreover , without UNK the latter of its UNK ; ; STOP
START rather , it UNK and UNK that UNK , UNK it STOP
START out of this UNK UNK , the UNK subject UNK STOP
START for it had turned out , by a further UNK of cubism , that the means to an illusion of depth and UNK had now become widely UNK from the means of representation or UNK STOP
START in the UNK phase of their cubism , UNK and picasso had not only had to minimize UNK simply in order to preserve it ; ; STOP
START they had also had to UNK it -- to the point , finally , where the illusion of depth and relief became UNK from specific UNK UNK and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as such : as a UNK UNK and UNK property UNK from everything not itself STOP
START in order to be saved , UNK had had to be isolated ; ; STOP
START and as the aspect of the subject was UNK into those UNK of more or less UNK and UNK UNK by which UNK was isolated under the UNK method , the subject itself became largely UNK STOP
START cubism , in its UNK phase ( which the french , with justice , call `` UNK '' ) was on the UNK of abstract art STOP
START it was then that picasso and UNK were confronted with a unique dilemma : they had to choose between illusion and representation STOP
START if they UNK for illusion , it could only be illusion per UNK -- an illusion of depth , and of relief , so general and UNK as to UNK the representation of individual objects STOP
START if , on the other hand , they UNK for representation , it had to be representation per UNK -- representation as image pure and simple , without UNK ( at least , without more than UNK ones ) of the UNK space in which the objects represented originally existed STOP
START it was the collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear : the UNK could be UNK and preserved only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become , for the first time , mutually exclusive alternatives STOP
START in the end , picasso and UNK UNK for the UNK , and it would seem they did so deliberately STOP
START ( this provides whatever real justification there is for the talk about `` reality '' STOP
START ) but the inner , formal UNK of cubism , as it worked itself out through the collage , had just as much to do with UNK their decision STOP
START when the smaller UNK of UNK cubism were placed upon or UNK with the large , UNK shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage , they had to UNK -- become `` UNK '' -- into larger UNK shapes themselves simply in order to maintain the UNK of the picture plane STOP
START left in their previous UNK UNK , they would have cut away too UNK into depth ; ; STOP
START and the broad , UNK shapes of UNK paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them UNK out of plane STOP
START large planes UNK with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes , and to the extent that they are flat , they also assert themselves as UNK ; ; STOP
START and independent UNK are apt to UNK with the UNK contours of the subject from which a picture starts ( if it does start from a subject ) STOP
START it was because of this UNK as much as for any other reason -- that is , because of the growing independence of the UNK unit in collage as a shape -- that the identity of UNK objects , or at least parts of them , UNK in UNK and UNK UNK UNK and continued to remain more UNK there -- but only as UNK UNK -- than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of UNK STOP
START UNK cubism came to an end in the collage , but not UNK ; ; STOP
START nor did synthetic cubism fully begin there STOP
START only when the collage had been UNK UNK into oil , and transformed by this translation , did cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , UNK UNK whose UNK and placement created UNK to , if not the illusion of , UNK UNK UNK STOP
START synthetic cubism began with picasso alone , late in UNK or early in UNK ; ; STOP
START this was the point at which he finally took the lead in UNK UNK away from UNK , never again to UNK it STOP
START but even before that , picasso had UNK and entered , for a moment , a certain revolutionary path in which no one had UNK him STOP
START it was as though , in that UNK , he had felt the UNK of collage as too UNK and had suddenly tried to escape all the way back -- or forward -- to literal UNK STOP
START this he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage ( and of cubism in general ) literally into the literal space in front of the picture plane STOP

START meanwhile , the automobile and its friend the UNK have cost the central city some of its industrial UNK STOP
START in ever greater numbers , factories are locating in the suburbs or in `` industrial parks '' removed from the UNK political jurisdiction STOP
START the appeal of the UNK is particularly strong for heavy industry , which must move UNK objects along a UNK assembly line and wants enough land area to do the entire job on one floor STOP
START to light industry , the UNK of being on one floor are much UNK , but efficiency engineers usually believe in them , and manufacturers looking for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers STOP
START this movement of industry away from the central cities is not so UNK new as some UNK seem to believe STOP
START it is merely the latest example of the UNK growth which formed the pattern of virtually all american cities STOP
START the big factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities -- the UNK factories in UNK , UNK UNK plants , UNK UNK works -- often began on these sites at a time when that was the edge of the city , yet close to transport ( river ) , storage ( UNK ) and power ( river ) STOP
START the `` UNK '' was a phenomenon of the railroad and the UNK UNK , and the time when the UNK of residence surrounding the old factory area were not yet UNK STOP
START the UNK and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his plant site STOP
START until internal combustion became UNK , he had to be near a railroad UNK and a UNK line or an existing large community of UNK homes STOP
START the railroad UNK is still important -- it is usually , though not always , true that UNK UNK by UNK is UNK than UNK STOP
START but anybody who UNK a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short UNK to his plant these days , and many businesses can live without the railroad STOP
START and there are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking lot , which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of UNK hour traffic and UNK bus lines , is actually more convenient than the UNK factory STOP
START UNK run , general UNK enormous installations at UNK and UNK , the UNK , UNK in UNK , UNK and UNK in los angeles , the new automobile assembly plants everywhere -- none of these is substantially served by any sort of conventional mass rapid transit STOP
START they are all suburban plants , UNK on the roads to keep them supplied with workers STOP
START and wherever the new UNK go up their banks are UNK by UNK glass and metal and colored UNK light industry STOP
START the drive along UNK route UNK , the UNK which makes an arc about twenty miles from downtown boston , may be a vision of the future STOP
START the future could be worse STOP
START the plants along route UNK are mostly well designed and UNK set against the new england UNK and trees STOP
START they can even be rather grand , like edward UNK monument to the UNK success of UNK STOP
START but they deny the values of the city -- the UNK , competitive , UNK city , the `` melting UNK '' which gave off so many of the most UNK american qualities STOP
START they are segregated businesses , UNK again on one site the factory and the office , drawing their work force from segregated communities STOP
START it is interesting to note how many of the plants on UNK route UNK draw most of their income either from the government in UNK UNK arrangements , or from the UNK of patents which grant at least a UNK UNK STOP
START while the factories were always the center of the labor market , they were often on the UNK UNK STOP
START in UNK the factories even farther , the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities STOP
START even the loss of hotel business to the UNK UNK has been relatively UNK ; ; STOP
START the UNK UNK is becoming harder to find every year STOP
START what UNK most is the damage the automobile has done to UNK UNK , especially in those cities where public transit is UNK STOP
START some UNK , of course , always UNK with the population -- UNK stores , UNK , local UNK and dress UNK , UNK stores and the like STOP
START but whenever a major purchase was UNK forty years ago -- a new UNK set or a winter coat , an UNK UNK , a UNK for junior -- the family set off for the downtown department store , where the selection would be greatest STOP
START department stores UNK in the `` one hundred per cent location '' , where all the transit lines UNK STOP
START these stores are still there , but the volume of the `` downtown store '' has been on a relative decline , while in many cities the suburban `` branch '' UNK more and more dry goods STOP
START if the UNK and UNK downtown unit sales have been UNK , however , his dollar volume continues to rise , and it is dollars which you put in the bank STOP
START in most discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially UNK STOP
START no suburban UNK branch -- not even hudson's vast UNK outside UNK -- does anything like the unit volume of business or UNK anything like the variety of UNK to be found in the home store STOP
START telephone orders UNK the picture : the UNK naturally calls a local rather than a UNK number if both are listed in an UNK , especially if the local call UNK city sales tax STOP
START the suburban branch is thereby UNK with a sale which would have been made even if its glass UNK had never opened STOP
START accounting procedures which continue to charge a UNK UNK and UNK expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are STOP
START in many cases that statement -- `` we break even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches '' -- would be turned around if the cost analysis were UNK on terms less UNK to the old store STOP
START fear of the competition -- always a great UNK force in the american economy -- makes UNK who do not have suburban operations UNK both the volume and the UNK of their UNK UNK new branches STOP
START the fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are UNK , that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown , and that even highly UNK cities will support only so many big branches STOP
START moreover , the cost of operations is always high in any new store , as the conservative UNK who act as UNK for retail UNK are beginning to discover STOP
START when all has been said , however , the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of american UNK STOP
START just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping center may seem far easier than to the downtown department store , though both are the same distance from home STOP
START indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping UNK customers who are UNK much UNK to downtown STOP
START UNK vernon reports that UNK of east UNK have been driving across the mississippi , through the heart of downtown UNK and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town STOP
START to the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of UNK brothers in UNK , ohio , can fight back successfully by building a UNK on the lot next door STOP
START if the distant UNK of the suburban branch has been UNK away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the UNK to do something about the UNK or UNK the completion of the federal highway program STOP
START and if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` UNK people '' , rather than with the UNK urban mass which UNK the downtown department store , the central location may be in serious trouble STOP
START today , according to land UNK UNK UNK , shopping centers and their associated parking lots cover some UNK acres of land , which is almost exactly the total land area in all the nation's central business districts put together STOP
START the downtown store continues to offer the great UNK of variety , both within its gates and across the street , where other department stores are immediately convenient for the UNK who wants to see what is available before making up her mind STOP
START if anything may be UNK in the UNK world of UNK , it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to UNK children's clothing ( taking the UNK downtown is too much of a production ) , household UNK and the discount business in UNK items STOP
START department stores were built on dry goods , especially UNK UNK , and in this area , in the long run , the suburban branches will be hard put to compete against downtown STOP
START if this analysis is correct , the suburban branches will turn out to be what UNK cost UNK UNK to UNK , marginal operations rather than major factors STOP
START historically in america the appeal of cities has been their color and life , the variety of experience they offered STOP
START `` how UNK UNK keep 'em down on the farm '' ? ? STOP
START was a question that had to be asked long before they saw UNK STOP
START though americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious belief , they liked to work and shop in the noise and UNK of downtown STOP
START only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central city would be likely to destroy this UNK -- and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change , UNK UNK by so many urban UNK , is actually upon us STOP

START the UNK may be remote , but this is surely the only UNK example of that vigorous UNK in the united states STOP
START UNK brumidi designed the UNK scheme as a whole , in UNK with the architect charles UNK , at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of UNK with the present much larger iron structure STOP
START after many years and many UNK he was able to finish the UNK UNK , and slightly less than half the frieze , beginning with the liberty group opposite the east door , and ending with william UNK , all but one leg , when a tragic accident ended his career STOP
START he left at his death sketches , drawn to scale , for the rest of the circle STOP
START these were carried out not too UNK by UNK UNK , who began by supplying the UNK member to the UNK of pennsylvania and noting in pencil , in italian , that he `` began at this point '' STOP
START when UNK had used up all the sketches UNK feet of empty frieze were left over STOP
START a UNK UNK UNK , UNK in UNK , UNK the wall of the UNK until 1951 STOP
START then , advised by the architect of the UNK , the joint committee for the UNK , UNK responsible for the works of art in the building , ordered the space UNK and painted in UNK , to show `` the peace after the civil war '' , `` the UNK war '' , and `` the birth of UNK '' , to match as nearly as feasible UNK technique and composition STOP
START later the cleaning and UNK were ordered , first of the older part of the frieze , finally of the UNK STOP
START what follows is therefore a description of three separate UNK , the new UNK of the gap , and the UNK UNK in UNK , with some discussion of problems that UNK in connection with each STOP
START for the use of students and future UNK , a full , UNK record was kept of all three UNK , complete technical reports on what we found and what we did STOP
START these may be UNK in the office of the architect of the UNK , or the UNK of congress STOP
START the first preliminary was UNK the UNK length of frieze , a UNK of UNK and finish UNK , all in bad condition STOP
START it was decided to strip the whole area down to the UNK , and to replace the rough UNK up to one inch thickness to agree with the older UNK preparation , with a UNK , one part UNK lime , three parts sand , to be put on in two UNK STOP
START UNK were drawn full size , after sketches had been made to satisfy all the authorities STOP
START there was some difficulty here STOP
START one had to manage the given subjects , three diverse recent events , so as to make them part of a classical frieze , -- that is , a pattern of large figures filling the space , with not much else , against a UNK background STOP
START moreover , all three UNK must be UNK UNK into little more than the length brumidi allowed for each one of his STOP
START when it was all arranged to fit , and not to UNK the UNK flow of movement in the frieze , the UNK were tried in place STOP
START the UNK , a confusion of heavy beams UNK from the UNK above , was strong and safe , but UNK UNK STOP
START nothing could be seen from the floor , but by moving around the UNK one could get UNK ; ; STOP
START and we were able to decide on some UNK of scale STOP
START to be sure of matching color as well as form , pieces of UNK were traced on the UNK , and large samples painted in UNK , then left two months to dry out to their final key STOP
START later it was UNK to note that they had set so UNK as to be hard to remove when the time came STOP
START the UNK was the length of the space to be painted STOP
START what UNK of brumidi and UNK could be reached at either end seemed in good order , though the UNK UNK surface was thick with dust STOP
START washed , they came out surprisingly clear and bright STOP
START it could be seen that both artists used a very thick final coat of plaster , one half inch , and that both followed the traditional italian UNK technique as described by UNK UNK in the UNK century , and current in italy to this day STOP
START that is , they used UNK color throughout , getting solid UNK with active lime white STOP
START painting `` a UNK '' is much in evidence STOP
START a brown UNK UNK and UNK UNK , and much of the background is UNK covered with a dark coat STOP
START this brown is sometimes so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint STOP
START in our own practice , to have the last `` UNK '' plaster coat thick enough to match , and at the same time to avoid fine UNK in drying , we found that it had to be put on in two UNK , letting the first set UNK before applying the second STOP
START the UNK was three parts sand to two of lime STOP
START some of the lime that is always on hand in the UNK basement for plaster UNK was UNK several months for us ; ; STOP
START but to make it UNK , of a really UNK consistency to avoid cracking , we added a little UNK lime -- hard on the hands , but we could see no other UNK STOP
START i am told that a UNK longer UNK might have remained longer in condition for painting STOP
START as it was , it took the UNK well for six hours , enough for our purpose , and held it firmly in setting STOP
START it was obvious that to match brumidi , white must be mixed with all but the UNK UNK STOP
START lime white , hard and brilliant , has a tendency to `` UNK '' away from the other colors in drying , and also by its capacity to set , to UNK the use of UNK UNK , so useful in UNK work STOP
START in older italian practice , lime , dried and UNK `` UNK UNK '' , entered into such prepared UNK STOP
START for UNK we chose a stronger UNK , unknown to the early UNK or to brumidi , UNK UNK , UNK the active lime white for highest lights , put on at the end of the UNK UNK STOP
START other UNK were mostly raw UNK , some UNK UNK , and a little yellow UNK STOP
START this last was probably not in UNK UNK , but was needed to take the UNK , UNK look off the new work next to the old , where UNK effects of time were seen , even after thorough cleaning STOP
START the use of `` UNK '' we tried to UNK to covering UNK STOP
START experience showed , however , that it is very difficult to paint a dark UNK background in UNK that will not dry out UNK and UNK STOP
START later brumidi and UNK will be seen UNK with this same problem STOP
START we were forced , as they were , to work a good deal of UNK into background and dark areas STOP
START we made it by UNK UNK , five parts thoroughly washed UNK UNK to one of lime UNK ; ; STOP
START ground together they made a strong UNK , which became UNK in drying STOP
START figure 1 was taken in 1953 STOP
START the new part is finished STOP
START on the right is the brumidi liberty group , as it looked after cleaning operations , which had not yet come around to the other end ; ; STOP
START where , of UNK , only some UNK has been washed , at the point where his work stopped STOP
START one is led to UNK as to why the empty space was there , left for our century to finish STOP
START UNK said it was UNK UNK in not providing enough material to fill the circle STOP
START UNK son later maintained that UNK had UNK and UNK his father's designs , UNK UNK a bit he could claim for his very own STOP
START this question might be settled by UNK the measurement of the actual UNK with the dimensions noted , presumably in UNK hand , above the various sections of his long UNK drawing , which has been kept STOP
START UNK UNK , it is evident that brumidi intended to fill out the whole frieze with his `` UNK '' and come full circle with the scene of the discovery of california gold STOP
START in painting a UNK , the handling of wet UNK UNK one always to move from top to bottom and from left to right , not to UNK UNK work with today's UNK STOP
START at the very first , then , brumidi was required , by the UNK UNK shape of his central group , to fill in the UNK space above the UNK girl on UNK right , before starting on the UNK figures themselves STOP
START here he put a small man , whose UNK hands might have left his function doubtful , until comparison with the first sketches showed that when the artist came back to the beginning , this was to be the UNK figure of the party of `` UNK '' , and was to hold a UNK STOP
START one sees UNK UNK of the same figure more than thirty feet away STOP
START the UNK , figure 1 of the completed frieze , shows how , having been separated from his fellows in UNK isolation for UNK years , he has now been given a hand , and by UNK ( and the permission of the committee ) , given a new job , to represent the UNK of the first flight at UNK UNK in UNK STOP
START the UNK bright effect of the first UNK led the committee to order the rest of the UNK cycle UNK and UNK to go with them STOP
START the fixed wooden UNK was removed , and , so as to reach all the frieze , one of UNK , on UNK , built up from the floor STOP
START every few days , in the early morning , as the work UNK , twenty men would appear to push it ahead and to shift the UNK foundation that distributed its weight widely on the UNK UNK , supported as it is by ancient UNK UNK STOP
START on this UNK and UNK platform over fifty feet from the floor , after a first UNK , we began to wash STOP
START a most useful tool for UNK the surface without running down was made from a UNK `` UNK spray '' UNK UNK to a UNK connection , to be used at low water pressure STOP
START a UNK in the handle let us cut the pressure still lower STOP
START one man UNK , with a UNK in hand to check excess UNK STOP
START a second assistant UNK with two UNK STOP
START in parts a repeated UNK was needed , but everywhere we found that water alone was enough to UNK the original brightness STOP
START no soap or other cleaning agent was used that might bring in UNK chemical reactions STOP
START the painting `` a UNK '' stood up UNK ; ; STOP
START a little of the `` UNK '' came off STOP
START necessary UNK was put on at once STOP
START altogether we found the UNK first rate , especially UNK STOP
START we were greatly helped by there being no UNK of former UNK STOP
START apparently not more than UNK had ever been done , and not much of that STOP
START the plaster was sound , the UNK firmly attached all over , and the UNK UNK incorporated with it in all but a few UNK places STOP
START the greatest source of trouble was rain which had repeatedly UNK from UNK above , UNK the surface and leaving UNK of dissolved lime , very UNK even after cleaning , particularly in the `` landing of UNK '' , `` UNK and the indians '' , and `` UNK '' STOP

START those whom i wish to address with this letter are for the most part unknown to me STOP
START it may well be that , when UNK UNK and i visited your country last spring , you were living and working close to the places we saw and the streets we walked STOP
START as american artists , it was natural that we would want to meet as many soviet artists as possible STOP
START this letter might not have been necessary had our efforts to meet and talk with you been more successful STOP
START even though we did not see many of your faces , it appears now quite evident that a considerable number of your profession heard , from those whom we had the UNK to encounter , that we had been in your UNK STOP
START i am very pleased that quite a number of you found ways to UNK to me your desire to hear of our reactions and experiences in the UNK STOP
START i can well understand your UNK STOP
START we , ourselves , are always eager to know how others feel about us and the way in which we live STOP
START it is my hope that this written message and report will reach you through the good offices of the union of soviet artists STOP
START there should be no reason to UNK or ignore the UNK of this letter STOP
START UNK and i UNK UNK to record our impressions without the UNK that the anxiety of our time so easily UNK STOP
START the UNK of little more than a month cannot UNK me to UNK as an expert on anything i saw STOP
START too much damage is done by `` experts '' who have spent even less time , if any at all , in the UNK STOP
START nevertheless i consider it reasonable , because of my UNK as an artist , to assume that the rights and responsibilities of creative individuals are related to humanity as a whole rather than to specific UNK interests STOP
START if this attitude is seriously questioned in the soviet union , it does not necessarily follow that the majority of the society in which i live is too aware of the necessity for clarity on this ethical as well as aesthetic point of view STOP
START it is a matter of some UNK to me that still many of my own UNK are too UNK to UNK any symbolic significance to the UNK of a minority , such as artists , in any social order STOP
START i encountered many questions and great interest upon my return from the soviet union about my reactions to that experience STOP
START that which i found most profound and most disturbing appeared to UNK a UNK UNK reaction STOP
START almost as if i were talking about something quite UNK STOP
START apparently this is not the time and the climate in which people will listen UNK , or at least UNK , to individual impressions of a subject which UNK a good deal of their UNK moments STOP
START personal UNK tend to UNK the ear and , in turn , the voice as well STOP
START i cannot be content with the UNK small talk of a somewhat unusual UNK STOP
START i am equally UNK with the UNK of the shoulder , UNK of the head of those who no longer care because they have known it for so long ; ; STOP
START the aggressive UNK of those who are UNK lost in a UNK UNK of the word `` revolution '' ; ; STOP
START the UNK UNK by the sick UNK of ignorance who try to build a UNK wall of UNK on our physical UNK STOP
START difficult as it may have been at times , UNK and i saw enough , talked to enough artists , historians and others to realize that the issue is quite clear STOP
START artists and poets are the raw UNK of humanity ; ; STOP
START they are small in number and their contribution is not immediately decisive in UNK life STOP
START by themselves they may not be able to save the life on this UNK , but without them there would be very little left worth saving STOP
START it cannot be said that our very first day in the soviet union turned out to be an ordinary one STOP
START on that cold , but bright , april day we were guests of your government in the UNK stand of red square to witness the UNK UNK for UNK UNK and later on that day we attended the somewhat more exclusive reception for him in one of the impressive UNK of the UNK STOP
START if we thus spent our very first day in the UNK of a large number of your people UNK a new hero and a great national achievement , our last day , to us at least , was equally impressive and very moving , even though the UNK were absent and there was almost complete silence STOP
START we stood under a UNK tree in the UNK country just outside of moscow looking at UNK flowers on the grave of a russian poet and writer who UNK the love for his country to the point of UNK the highest international honor STOP
START the grave , about UNK between his home and the blue UNK of a small church , rose above the forms and UNK of gently UNK UNK of green , the sounds of birds , the silence of other UNK and the UNK UNK through small forests STOP
START just UNK we had met and talked with a living writer , a contemporary of the dead poet , who is known for his ability of UNK his ideas and his UNK more UNK STOP
START but today we were aware of only two men STOP
START one had taken a flight into UNK space , in the service of science , to return as a living hero STOP
START the other had assumed the right to UNK the equally UNK space of the human spirit STOP
START the flowers on his grave UNK to the fact that he as well was UNK hero STOP
START these two UNK form the frame around a series of experiences and UNK which , to me at least , UNK the UNK in the aesthetic as well as ethical conflict between UNK and UNK STOP
START a struggle that is being UNK all over the world in the UNK of UNK STOP
START the UNK opinion which we encountered in a variety of expressions in your country denied not only the existence of this conflict but it was UNK even further with an incredible UNK UNK STOP
START the socialist environment , it was stated , had UNK these two extreme seeds and was about to produce a new plant and fruit STOP
START when i UNK on one such occasion that the new growth , like other UNK , might be unable to UNK , i was immediately accused of preaching racial UNK STOP
START i could not bring myself to answer that `` some of my best friends are UNK UNK '' STOP
START this kind of UNK and UNK takes a little time to get used to STOP
START after a while we were perhaps less UNK , but still UNK , when a friendly discussion would suddenly UNK the track into the most UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START a chance remark about UNK sealed train brought the UNK that this was a myth UNK to george UNK UNK tree STOP
START theories of the behavior pattern of population masses were compared to scientific UNK concerning the UNK of UNK masses STOP
START no wonder that UNK and i had at times difficulty in UNK the real purpose of our presence , namely , cultural exchange STOP
START typical of such an experience was the occasion of a somewhat formal official welcome in the offices of the union of soviet artists STOP
START we had looked forward to what we hoped to be our first UNK meeting with a number of UNK artists STOP
START instead , we became involved in a series of friendly , but UNK formal , UNK addresses to which we had no choice but to UNK in kind STOP
START the terms of friendship , understanding , cooperation , etc, tend to become somewhat UNK because of constant and UNK use STOP
START i can only hope that the continuing exchange of groups and individuals between our countries will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion STOP
START the UNK female UNK , of massive proportions and UNK appearance , initially did not contribute to the expressions of friendship and welcome by a number of UNK UNK representing the arts STOP
START it was only after we had responded , with what i fear were similar UNK , that she went into action by UNK our desire for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and UNK actions by the UNK in cuba and laos STOP
START she UNK by leaving the room when we suggested that our meeting might well UNK right then and there STOP
START unfortunately she returned later , just as i had taken advantage of the UNK atmosphere in the room by stating that perhaps an unexpected result of the cultural exchange program would be the UNK of abstract art in russia , with social realism UNK UNK in the UNK STOP
START this gave her an opportunity to ring down the UNK with the UNK UNK that we should not UNK to UNK her on abstraction STOP
START she did not go so far as to say , as was done on other occasions , that abstraction as well as UNK were a russian invention that had been UNK as UNK by the people of the UNK STOP
START STOP
START UNK and i could not know then that we would experience this sort of treatment more often in moscow than elsewhere STOP
START we were to discover , in fact , that quite a number of people share with us the impression that , in contrast to other soviet regions , UNK atmosphere is UNK UNK and official STOP
START to have one's UNK deliberately or UNK UNK is always a waste of time STOP
START until our moscow experience , i had not considered it necessary to prepare any argument UNK or UNK STOP
START artists simply do not talk to each other in that fashion ; ; STOP
START and , furthermore , i could not UNK the UNK that i spoke for american artists as a group STOP
START to save time , some UNK seemed necessary STOP
START the following is a statement read to a large and friendly group of your fellow artists in UNK : STOP
START `` we have come to your land with the express intention of understanding and UNK your ideas and your ways STOP
START our presence here should also be considered further , UNK evidence of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to seek any and all possible ways to effect closer , peaceful ties among all people STOP
START we are quite convinced that one of the main hopes for the future depends upon the UNK contacts and UNK of ideas between individuals STOP
START in spite of the relatively short period of time that we have experienced among you , we have already seen many indications of your character and spirit STOP
START we are UNK aware that UNK is a society which , in spite of several wars and many UNK , has developed itself into one of the UNK nations of the world STOP
START your past history is UNK with the fruits of the UNK STOP
START your present history is equally UNK for its industrial and scientific achievements STOP
START we have come to you to experience something of your way of life while also attempting to UNK you with that of ours STOP
START while we , as american artists , believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual activity , we would be less than honest with you , or ourselves , if we failed to state a specific attitude toward our own society as well as the international community as a whole STOP
START in stating this position , we should like to make it clear to you that we cannot expect artists and UNK in other lands to share our opinion in every respect STOP
START as a matter of fact , we prize the diversity among our own people so much that we will not UNK to speak for all other american artists STOP
START but certainly , all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge and search for UNK between you and us , but rather the UNK exploration and acceptance of our differences which may lead us to our respective and desired goals with a minimum of UNK STOP
START like UNK , we have pride and love for our country STOP
START to many of us , this is a land to which we or our parents fled from UNK UNK in order to live in UNK freedom STOP
START as artists we feel the same obligation , as do other individuals , in considering ourselves responsible citizens of a great nation STOP
START the UNK society is an UNK work STOP
START its scope is as broad as the question : what does it mean to live in modern society ? ? STOP
START a work so broad , even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed by a moral vision , must necessarily `` fail '' STOP
START even a UNK reader will easily find in it numerous blind spots , errors of fact and argument , important UNK , areas of ignorance and UNK , UNK UNK on UNK , examples of broad positions supported by UNK evidence , and the like STOP
START such books are easy UNK for critics STOP
START nor need the critic be UNK STOP
START a careful and UNK man , who values precision and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility , might easily be put off by such a book STOP
START it is a simple matter , for one so disposed , to take a work like the UNK society and UNK it into UNK and ends STOP
START the thing can be made to look like the UNK UNK of a large and vigorous family -- a UNK UNK of UNK objects , some UNK and some that were never useful , some once whole and bright but now UNK and UNK , some odd pieces whose history no one UNK , here and there a UNK , everything UNK because it suggests some part of the human condition -- the whole adding up to nothing more than a UNK into the UNK history of the makers and UNK STOP
START that could be easily done , but there is little reason in it STOP
START it would come down to saying that fromm UNK with a broad brush , and that , after all , is not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression he has from the UNK STOP
START i mention these features of the book because they are inherent in the UNK character and therefore must be mentioned STOP
START it would be UNK to build a UNK around them STOP
START there are more substantial UNK to be made of fromm's account of UNK civilization STOP
START it is UNK to recall that fromm's treatment has both UNK and UNK aspects STOP
START since i have already discussed his moral position , that discussion is incorporated by reference into the following pages , which will focus on the empirical and analytic side of fromm's treatment STOP
START i shall first indicate a couple of UNK in fromm's analysis , then argue that , granted these UNK , he still has much left that is valuable , and , finally , raise the general question of a philosophical UNK a UNK approach to the question of alienation STOP
START almost no empirical work has been done on the problem of alienation STOP
START despite its rather long intellectual history , alienation is still a promising hypothesis and not a UNK theory STOP
START the idea has received much attention in philosophy , in literature , and in a few works of general social criticism , such as the UNK society STOP
START what is UNK is work that would answer , presumably by the use of survey methods and UNK attitude UNK , such questions as these : what are the components of the UNK described as alienation ? ? STOP
START how widespread is alienation ? ? STOP
START what is its UNK among the various classes and UNK of the population ? ? STOP
START taking alienation as a dependent variable , with what UNK factors is it most highly associated ? ? STOP
START considered as an independent variable , how does it affect behavior in various UNK of life ? ? STOP
START until such work is done , there must remain the UNK suspicion that alienation may be little more than an expression of the UNK of the intellectual , who , rejected by and in turn UNK the larger society , projects his own fear and despair onto the broader social screen STOP
START i am not UNK that fromm ought to do this kind of work STOP
START nor do i think that alienation is nothing more than a UNK of the UNK of the intellectual STOP
START i am saying only that until a UNK and different kind of evidence comes in , any discussion of alienation must be understood to have certain important limitations STOP
START until such evidence appears , we must make do with the evidence we have STOP
START here , perhaps , fromm is UNK , for he does not always use the best and most recent evidence available , and he sometimes UNK and UNK the evidence in rather special ways STOP
START three examples follow STOP
START fromm's analysis of alienation in the sphere of production centers around the concepts of the UNK of the corporation , the separation of ownership from control , and the broad ( and thus from the point of view of corporate control , UNK ) UNK of stock ownership STOP
START for all these points he UNK exclusively on UNK and UNK study of UNK , the modern corporation and private property STOP
START the broad conclusions of that UNK work remain UNK , but subsequent research has expanded and somewhat altered their empirical support , has suggested important UNK in the general analytic frame of reference , and has UNK the meaning of particular analytic concepts in this area STOP
START fromm seems UNK of these developments STOP
START another example is his very UNK use of the large amount of data from surveys designed to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on a broad range of UNK : he UNK such UNK findings just three times STOP
START moreover , the conclusions he draws from the findings are not always the only ones possible STOP
START for example , he UNK the following data from two studies on job satisfaction : in the first study , UNK per cent of UNK and UNK , UNK per cent of white UNK people , and UNK per cent of factory workers expressed satisfaction with their jobs ; ; STOP
START in the second study , the UNK were UNK for UNK , UNK for UNK persons , UNK for commercial employees , UNK for skilled workers , and UNK for UNK workers STOP
START he UNK that these data show a `` remarkably high '' percentage of UNK UNK and unhappy persons among factory and UNK workers STOP
START starting from other value UNK than fromm's , some UNK might conclude that the UNK really tell us very little at all , while others might even conclude that the figures are remarkably low STOP
START UNK UNK , for example , once said that america was a UNK -- the only one in the history of the world -- for UNK and small children STOP
START what matters is that while fromm's reading of the data is not the only one possible , it is precisely the one we would expect from a writer who UNK believes that every man can and ought to be happy and satisfied STOP
START fromm also UNK a UNK on attitudes toward work UNK conducted by the opinion research corporation in 1945 , in which UNK per cent of UNK workers said a man ought to turn out as much as he could in a UNK work , while UNK per cent said he should not do his best but should turn out only the average amount STOP
START fromm says these data show that job UNK and UNK are widespread STOP
START that is one way to read the findings , but again there are other ways STOP
START one might use such findings to indicate the strength of UNK primary associations in the factory , an interpretation which would run UNK to fromm's theory of alienation STOP
START or , he might UNK fromm that the UNK per cent figure is really UNK low : after all , the medieval UNK system was dedicated to the proposition that 100 per cent of the workers ought to turn out only the average amount ; ; STOP
START and today's trade UNK UNK pretty much the same view STOP
START in view of these UNK in both the amount and the interpretation of UNK findings on public opinion , and considering the UNK which can be brought against fromm's philosophical UNK , such a passage as the following cannot be taken seriously STOP
START `` are people happy , are they as satisfied , UNK , as they believe themselves to be ? ? STOP
START considering the nature of man , and the conditions for happiness , this can hardly be so '' STOP
START the UNK suggested above stem from a more basic difficulty in fromm's style of thought STOP
START he seems to use the term alienation in two different ways STOP
START sometimes he uses it as a subjective , UNK term , and sometimes as an objective , UNK one STOP
START that is , sometimes it is used to describe felt human misery , and other times it is UNK to explain UNK anxiety and UNK STOP
START the failure to keep these two UNK distinct presents UNK to the reader STOP
START it also permits fromm to do some UNK things with empirical findings STOP
START when alienation is used as an objective and UNK category , for example , it becomes clear that fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation goes far toward UNK it STOP
START ( he , in effect , does say this in his discussion of the UNK of the UNK UNK STOP
START ) starting from this , and accepting his estimate of the UNK of modern society , it would follow that the really disturbing evidence of alienation would be that of a UNK survey which reported widespread , stated worker satisfaction , rather than widespread , stated worker UNK STOP
START the point is that in a system such as fromm's which UNK unconscious UNK , and which rests on certain ethical UNK , empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition the writer is UNK at the moment STOP
START thus , in the example cited above fromm rests his whole case on the UNK that the workers are being UNK UNK , UNK , of UNK , and then UNK this with survey data reporting conscious , experienced UNK STOP
START he has his UNK and UNK it too : if the workers say they are UNK , this shows conscious alienation ; ; STOP
START if they say they are satisfied , this shows unconscious alienation STOP
START this sort of UNK is especially UNK in fromm's work because , although his system is derived largely from certain UNK convictions , he UNK that it is based on empirical findings drawn both from social science and from his own UNK room STOP
START while the `` empirical UNK '' UNK which fromm claims UNK no light on the validity of his underlying philosophy , it does increase the UNK of his product STOP
START the final example of the failure to use available evidence , though evidence of a different kind from that which has so far been considered , comes from fromm's treatment of some other writers who have dealt with the same UNK STOP
START in a brief chapter dealing with `` various other UNK '' , he UNK isolated passages from some writers whose views seem to UNK his own , and finds it `` most remarkable that a critical view of UNK society was already held by a number of UNK living in the nineteenth STOP
START '' he finds it equally `` remarkable that their critical UNK and UNK should have so much in common among themselves and with the critics of the twentieth century '' STOP
START there is nothing remarkable about this at all STOP
START it is largely a matter of finding passages that suit one's purposes STOP
START there is a difference between evidence and illustration , and fromm's UNK of the other UNK UNK the latter category STOP
START glance at the list : UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , london , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK STOP
START this is a UNK UNK collection STOP
START one can make them say the same thing only by not UNK to them very carefully and hearing only what one wants to hear STOP
START the method of selection fromm uses UNK exactly that STOP
START furthermore , the list is interesting for its UNK STOP
START it UNK , for example , practically the whole line of great nineteenth century english social critics , nearly all the great writers whose basic position is religious , and all those who are with more or less accuracy called UNK STOP
START of course , the list also UNK all writers who are fairly `` optimistic '' about the modern situation ; ; STOP
START these , almost by definition , are UNK for an UNK UNK STOP
START it is not hard to find that UNK of opinion which fromm finds so remarkable when you ignore all who hold a different opinion STOP
START turning from these problems of the use of evidence , one meets another type of difficulty in fromm's analysis , which is his loose and ambiguous use of certain important terms STOP
START one such instance has already been presented : his use of alienation STOP
START the only other one i shall mention here is his use of the term UNK STOP
START for fromm , UNK is the enemy , the root of all evil STOP
START it is of course useful to have a sovereign cause on one's social criticism , for it makes UNK and UNK much easier than they might otherwise be STOP
START if one characteristic UNK UNK UNK , it is the consistency with which every person on the stage -- including the UNK -- comes alive in the music STOP
START much of this UNK quality results from UNK care in UNK his UNK line on natural speech UNK STOP
START in this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera ; ; STOP
START such UNK as UNK , UNK and UNK , with the same goal in mind , had developed styles of UNK UNK UNK to their own languages STOP
START through long experimentation in his songs , UNK developed a russian UNK as different from others as the language itself STOP
START giving most of his musical continuity to the orchestra , he UNK the speech fall into place as if by UNK , but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words STOP
START the moments of UNK melody , in the usual sense , come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing , as in folk songs and UNK UNK STOP
START otherwise UNK UNK his UNK UNK for prolonged expressions of emotion -- UNK first UNK , for example STOP
START even then , the flexibility of the UNK suggests that the word comes first in importance STOP
START aside from UNK himself , one need but examine the secondary roles to place UNK among the UNK of musical UNK STOP
START even those who appear in only one or two scenes are full UNK , defined with economical precision STOP
START consider the four UNK who figure UNK in the action : UNK , UNK , UNK and the UNK UNK STOP
START under no circumstances could we mistake one for the other ; ; STOP
START each musical setting has an individual touch STOP
START UNK is an old man , weak in body -- his voice rarely rises to a full UNK -- but firm and clear of mind STOP
START his UNK offers contrast to UNK UNK excitement STOP
START a quiet but UNK theme , somewhat UNK in character , appears whenever the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his own past life : STOP
START this theme comes to represent the outer world , the realm of UNK and UNK -- seen from a distance , quite distinct from the UNK spiritual life in the UNK STOP
START it changes and UNK according to the text ; ; STOP
START it UNK UNK when he comes before UNK in the last act STOP
START once he has been identified , however , a new melody is used to UNK his narrative , a UNK UNK with UNK UNK creating a rather ancient effect : STOP
START an imaginative UNK , UNK takes on the character he describes , as if he were UNK the old UNK blindness and UNK cure STOP
START here the composer uses a favorite device of his , the UNK of the UNK through key relationships STOP
START the original d minor seems to UNK blindness , UNK in spite of all attempts to move away from it STOP
START as the child addresses the UNK in a dream , light -- in the form of the major mode -- begins to appear , and at the moment of the UNK we hear a clear and UNK d major STOP
START UNK and UNK always appear together and often sing together , in a UNK , UNK vigorous UNK that UNK them from the more subtle and UNK UNK STOP
START their UNK song might easily be a folk melody : STOP
START the same could be said for the song to which they make their entrance in the final scene STOP
START apparently their origin is humble , their approach to life direct and UNK STOP
START whatever learning they may have had in their order doesn't UNK them now STOP
START UNK is the straight man , not very UNK , UNK when he does speak STOP
START UNK is UNK , UNK , UNK in his UNK and UNK with anyone who is not the same STOP
START a rough UNK figure , heard first in the introduction to the UNK scene , UNK him UNK and UNK whenever he comes into the action : STOP
START the song of UNK , in which this figure becomes a UNK UNK , UNK in the picture of UNK high spirits STOP
START the UNK is UNK , and the abrupt key changes have a primitive UNK STOP
START ( we can imagine how they UNK audiences of the UNK STOP
START ) STOP
START UNK music begins to UNK as he feels the effects of the wine , but he UNK himself together when the need UNK STOP
START both UNK respond to the UNK challenge with a few phrases of their UNK song ; ; STOP
START a UNK UNK touch is UNK UNK reading of the warrant STOP
START as the UNK gradually comes back to him , his rhythm becomes UNK , with the rigid UNK of an UNK reader STOP
START for the only time in the opera , words are not set according to their natural UNK ; ; STOP
START to do so would have UNK the dramatic point of the scene STOP
START UNK and UNK , UNK is as far removed from the conventional monk as UNK STOP
START his music shows a UNK coupled with an UNK quality that suggest somehow a UNK with UNK in UNK UNK STOP
START his speech shows none of the native UNK of the russian characters ; ; STOP
START in spite of the italian name , he sounds french STOP
START his personality appears more striking by contrast with UNK , who is -- perhaps UNK -- rather UNK characterized STOP
START UNK first entrance is a musical shock , a sudden open fifth in a key UNK UNK to what has UNK it STOP
START the effect is as if he had UNK out of nowhere STOP
START he speaks UNK , UNK his authority beneath a smooth UNK , just as the UNK UNK that UNK him all but UNK the firm UNK point beneath them STOP
START he addresses UNK with great UNK , calling her `` UNK '' at first ; ; STOP
START it is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme that he uses her given name , placing himself by UNK in the position of a UNK father STOP
START UNK , this scene is a close parallel to one that UNK was writing at the same time , the scene between UNK and UNK STOP
START UNK and UNK have the same purpose -- UNK the girl to UNK the man she UNK into serving her UNK cause -- and their tactics are much the same STOP
START UNK begins by describing the sad state of the church ; ; STOP
START this brings a reaction of distress from UNK STOP
START the music becomes UNK as he calls up a vision of her own UNK : it is she , he tells her , who can bring the truth to russia and UNK the UNK STOP
START as if in a UNK , she UNK his words -- then UNK , with a shock , her own UNK STOP
START this is no assignment for a UNK girl , she UNK him STOP
START now UNK comes to the point , and we hear , for the first time , a long , downward UNK scale that will become the characteristic UNK of his UNK power STOP
START it is a phrase as UNK as a UNK gesture , with a UNK turn of harmony giving an effect of UNK STOP
START another theme , UNK UNK , appears as he UNK her to gain power over UNK by any means , even at the cost of her honor STOP
START coming from a priest , the music sounds as odd as the advice : STOP
START UNK UNK at this suggestion STOP
START her pride is as much at UNK as her virtue ; ; STOP
START she is the UNK beauty , the UNK who turns away UNK by the dozen STOP
START UNK she UNK UNK for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her STOP
START at once the UNK UNK out all the UNK STOP
START to music of a UNK darkness , he describes the powers of UNK UNK control of the girl , UNK her soul with pride and destroying her beauty STOP
START the combined threat of UNK and UNK is too much for her , and she falls UNK at his feet STOP
START with another sudden change of UNK , he is again calm and UNK , UNK her to trust and UNK him as god's UNK -- and the UNK scale UNK in UNK UNK STOP
START whatever the source of UNK power , UNK is his UNK now ; ; STOP
START we are reminded of this at the end of the next scene , when his theme cuts through the UNK of the love UNK , again UNK a UNK over the atmosphere STOP
START the most unusual feature of UNK , however , is the use of the greatest character of all , the UNK STOP
START this is the real UNK of the drama ; ; STOP
START the conflict is not UNK UNK UNK or UNK or even the UNK of the UNK child , but UNK UNK the russian people STOP
START UNK makes this quite clear by the extent to which UNK scenes UNK the action STOP
START UNK first entrance seems almost a UNK to the UNK of the UNK scene , with its UNK confusion of UNK STOP
START we have a brief UNK of the UNK public personality , the `` official UNK '' , but our real focus is on the excitement of the crowd -- a significant contrast with its UNK UNK in the opening scene , its bitter UNK and UNK in the final act STOP
START one reason for the unique UNK of the UNK is its great variety in expression STOP
START it rarely speaks as a unit STOP
START even in its most conventional appearance , the UNK song of UNK to UNK , there are a few female UNK UNK the UNK for her UNK STOP
START in many passages -- for example , the council of UNK -- each section of the UNK becomes a character group with a particular opinion STOP
START hot UNK arise between UNK and UNK , who will sing in harmony only when they agree on an idea STOP
START the opening scene shows this method at its most individual STOP
START UNK UNK a telling picture of the common people , those who must suffer the effects of their UNK struggle for power without understanding the causes STOP
START they are held in control by force , but barely STOP
START they will UNK and UNK for UNK leadership in a UNK intense song , its phrases UNK broken as if UNK for breath , but when the police with their UNK move away , they UNK and UNK and fight among themselves STOP
START there is a quick change from the UNK song to a UNK tone STOP
START `` UNK , UNK '' , UNK one group , `` what are we UNK about '' ? ? STOP
START and UNK , apparently the intellectual leader of the crowd , UNK that he has no notion STOP
START the UNK and UNK grow UNK until the police return ; ; STOP
START then the people strike up their song with even more UNK than before , ending it with a UNK of despair STOP
START UNK frequently uses UNK music with considerable dramatic force STOP
START in UNK cell the soft prayers of the UNK , heard from UNK , not only help to set the scene but emphasize the contrast between young UNK thoughts and his situation STOP
START this is especially striking between UNK quiet UNK and UNK UNK UNK against UNK STOP
START again , as UNK feels himself UNK death , a UNK UNK into the hall singing a UNK , its UNK UNK adding a UNK touch to the UNK atmosphere : the words are hardly calculated to put the UNK mind at ease STOP
START they UNK the words with which he has described his own vision of the UNK child who `` UNK and UNK for mercy -- and there is no mercy '' STOP
START the living as well as the dead now UNK him ; ; STOP
START this final UNK of his guilt is the fatal one STOP
START one of the outstanding UNK of the present production is the UNK of the UNK scene , usually UNK from performances and rarely included in a published score STOP
START though brief , it has a sharp dramatic edge and great UNK STOP
START in addition , it is an important UNK in the plot , giving us a UNK UNK of the people's attitude toward UNK and the false UNK STOP
START the UNK in the forest of UNK is a natural UNK STOP
START the UNK scene UNK with little groups of UNK milling around the square , the ever present police keeping them under UNK STOP
START in the orchestra we hear first a UNK , UNK UNK figure , then the UNK `` police '' UNK as it appeared in the opening scene STOP
START the service is over , and a number of people come from the church with their UNK UNK in the lead STOP
START they bring the news that the UNK has been UNK ; ; STOP
START this is met with UNK by the UNK , who claim that UNK is lying or UNK STOP
START ( UNK UNK UNK the two groups by their UNK UNK , UNK UNK or UNK UNK STOP
START ) there is still more news , UNK UNK : they have UNK for the soul of the UNK STOP
START so far these remarks , like most UNK of hardy , have UNK assumed that his poetry is all of a piece , one solid mass of verse expressing a UNK at a single stage of development STOP
START for critics , hardy has had no poetic periods -- one does not speak of early hardy or late hardy , or of the london or UNK gate period , but simply of hardy , as of a poetic UNK STOP
START this seems odd when one UNK that he wrote poetry longer than any other major english poet : `` UNK '' is dated `` between UNK and UNK '' ; ; STOP
START `` seeing the moon rise '' is dated august , 1927 STOP
START one might expect that in a poetic career of UNK years , some changes in style and method would have occurred , some development taken place STOP
START this is not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to hardy only in a very limited sense STOP
START in a time when poetic style , and poetic belief as well , seem in a state of UNK flux , hardy stands out as a poet of almost UNK consistency STOP
START though he UNK with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the UNK of his UNK ; ; STOP
START the `` UNK opinion '' of his letter to UNK , written when hardy was UNK years old , is essentially that of his first `` philosophical '' UNK entry , made when he was twenty-five : `` the world does not UNK us : it only UNK us '' ( early life , UNK ) STOP
START and though in his later years he revised his poems many times , the UNK did not UNK the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty ; ; STOP
START so that , while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by hardy , it is difficult to date one STOP
START there is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about hardy's development : he did develop toward a more consistent and more effective control of that tone which we recognize as UNK his STOP
START there is only one hardy style , but in the earlier poems that style is only UNK evident , and when it is not , the style is the style of another poet , or of the fashion of the time STOP
START in the later poems , however , the personal tone UNK STOP
START the bad early poems are bad shakespeare or bad UNK ; ; STOP
START the bad late poems are bad hardy STOP
START there are two ways of getting at a UNK development : through his dated poems , and through the UNK which he made in later UNK of his work STOP
START about a quarter of hardy's poems carry an UNK date line , usually the year of completion , but sometimes UNK years ( `` UNK - 1910 '' ) or two separate dates when hardy worked on the poem ( `` UNK and UNK '' ) or an approximate date ( `` during the war '' ) STOP
START these dates are virtually the only UNK we have to the UNK of the poems , since the separate volumes are neither UNK within themselves nor in relation to each other STOP
START with the exception of UNK of circumstance , each volume contains dated poems ranging over several decades ( winter words UNK UNK years ) ; ; STOP
START the internal organization rarely has any UNK order , except in obvious groups like the `` poems of UNK '' , the `` poems of 1912 - 13 '' , and the war poems STOP
START from the dated poems we can venture certain conclusions about hardy's career in poetry , always UNK that conclusions based on a fraction of the whole must remain UNK STOP
START the dated poems suggest that while hardy's concern with poetry may have been constant , his production was not STOP
START he had two productive periods , one in the late UNK , the other in the decade from 1910 to UNK ( half of the dated poems are from the latter period , and these alone total about UNK of all hardy's poems ) STOP
START there was one UNK period : only one poem is dated between UNK and UNK and , except for the poems written on the trip to italy in UNK , very few from UNK to UNK STOP
START the dated poems also give us an idea of the degree to which hardy drew upon past UNK for his various volumes , and therefore probably are an indication of the amount of poetry he was writing at the time STOP
START poems of the past and the present and UNK UNK UNK , both published while hardy was at work on the UNK , draw heavily on poems written before 1900 STOP
START UNK of circumstance and moments of vision , coming during his most productive decade , are relatively UNK ; ; STOP
START the former contains no poem dated before UNK - 10 -- that is , no poem from a period covered by a previous volume -- and the latter has only a few such STOP
START the last three volumes are again more dependent on the past , as hardy's creative powers UNK in his old age STOP
START these observations about hardy's productivity UNK with the details of his life as we know them STOP
START the first productive period came when he was considering poetry as a UNK , before he had decided to write fiction for a living ( in his note for UNK who he wrote that he `` wrote UNK UNK - UNK ; ; STOP
START gave up verse for prose , UNK - 70 ; ; STOP
START but resumed it later '' ) STOP
START during the UNK UNK years he was writing novels at the rate of almost one a year and was , in addition , UNK with bad health ( he spent six months in bed in UNK , too ill to do more than work slowly and UNK at a UNK ) STOP
START two entries in the early life support the assumption that during this period hardy had virtually suspended the writing of poetry STOP
START UNK records that `` at the end of november ( UNK ) he makes a note of an intention to UNK poetry as soon as possible '' ( early life , UNK ) ; ; STOP
START and on christmas day , UNK , hardy wrote : `` while thinking of UNK ' the UNK wings of UNK before UNK this morning , new UNK seemed to open , and UNK UNK to UNK '' ( early life , UNK ) STOP
START there are more poems dated in the UNK than in the UNK -- hardy had apparently resumed the UNK wings as he UNK the volume of his fiction -- but none in UNK , the year of UNK , and only one in UNK , the year of UNK STOP
START after UNK the number increases , and in the next thirty years there is only one year for which there is no dated poem -- UNK , when hardy was at work on the UNK STOP
START the second productive period , the decade from 1910 to UNK , can be related to three events : the completion of the UNK in UNK , which left hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years ; ; STOP
START the death of UNK hardy in 1912 , which had a profound emotional effect on hardy for which he found release in poetry ; ; STOP
START and the first world war STOP
START it may seem strange that a poet should come to full UNK in his UNK , but we have it on hardy's own authority that `` he was a child till he was sixteen , a youth till he was UNK , and a young man till he was nearly fifty '' ( early life , UNK ) STOP
START we may carry this sequence one step further and say that at UNK he was a poet at the height of his powers , UNK only the UNK of two UNK , one personal , the other national , to loose those powers in poetry STOP
START hardy's two productive decades were separated by forty years , yet between them he developed only in that he became more steadily himself -- it was a UNK , not an expanding process STOP
START like a wise UNK , hardy UNK away the UNK UNK and songs , and the elements of UNK and poetic UNK to which his personal style was not suited , and let the main stock of his talent UNK STOP
START the range of the later poetry is considerably UNK , but the number of successful poems is far greater STOP
START we can see the general characteristics of the earlier decade if we look at two poems of very different qualities : `` UNK '' ( UNK ) and `` neutral UNK '' ( UNK ) STOP
START there is not much to be said for `` UNK '' STOP
START like about half of the UNK - 70 poems , it is a UNK on a conventional theme -- the UNK of love STOP
START almost anyone could have written it ; ; STOP
START it is competent in the sense that it makes a UNK statement without UNK the rules of the UNK form , but it is entirely UNK and entirely unlike hardy STOP
START the language is the conventional language of the form ; ; STOP
START there is no phrase or image that sounds like hardy or that is striking enough to give UNK to the poem STOP
START it is UNK than hardy usually is , but with the UNK of UNK STOP
START it is obviously a young man's poem , written out of books and not out of experience ; ; STOP
START it UNK emotion without UNK it -- that is to say , it is UNK STOP
START there are many such UNK UNK performances among the earlier poems STOP
START `` neutral UNK '' we immediately recognize as a fine poem in hardy's most characteristic style : the plain but not quite UNK language , the hard , particular , UNK images , the slightly odd UNK , the dramatic handling of the occasion , the refusal to UNK the issue -- all these we have seen in hardy's best poems STOP
START the poem does not UNK the UNK of ordinary speech nor draw on UNK sources of UNK , yet it is obviously not ordinary speech -- only hardy would say `` a UNK of UNK swept thereby ; ; STOP
START like an UNK bird UNK '' , or `` UNK with wrong '' , or would describe a winter sun as `` UNK '' STOP
START the details of the setting of `` neutral UNK '' are not , strictly speaking , UNK , but they combine to create a UNK which is appropriate both to a UNK winter day and to the end of love , and in this way love and weather , the emotions and the elements , UNK each other in a way that is common to many of hardy's best poems ( `` UNK '' , `` the UNK UNK '' , and `` during wind and rain '' , for example ) and to some moving passages in the novels as well ( far from the UNK crowd is full of scenes constructed in this way ) STOP
START `` neutral UNK '' is an excellent example of hardy's mature style , drawn from his earliest productive period ; ; STOP
START i UNK it as evidence that he did not develop through new styles as he grew older ( as UNK did ) , but that he simply learned to use better what he already had STOP
START in the poem we recognize and UNK one man's sense of the world ; ; STOP
START if it is UNK , it is also precise , and the precision UNK authority to the vision STOP
START in `` UNK '' , on the other hand , the UNK is a case not UNK ; ; STOP
START the poem offers nothing to UNK us of the UNK right to speak as he does STOP
START in the UNK - 70 decade there are many poems like `` UNK '' , but there is only one `` neutral UNK '' STOP
START hardy was not hardy very often STOP
START the `` poems of 1912 - 13 '' offer a good example of hardy's style as it was UNK in the later productive decade STOP
START these are the poems hardy wrote after the death of his first wife ; ; STOP
START they UNK a painful UNK to what might have been , to a marriage that began with a promise of happiness , and ended in long years of suffering and UNK STOP
START hardy obviously felt that these poems were UNK personal and private ; ; STOP
START he sometimes called them `` an UNK '' , and he would not allow them to be published in UNK STOP
START they are the only poems that he UNK as a group between their first appearance ( in UNK of circumstance ) and the publication of the collected poems STOP
START the UNK tone is hardy's natural tone of voice , and it is not surprising that the 1912 - 13 poems are consistently and UNK his STOP
START the view is always toward the past ; ; STOP
START but the UNK is not quite UNK -- hardy would not allow sentiment to UNK his sense of the UNK UNK of the past , and the eternal UNK of the dead STOP
START the poems are , the UNK tells us , the `` UNK of an ancient UNK '' ; ; STOP
START the fire of love is dead , and hardy stands , as the speaker does in the last poem of the sequence , over the UNK circle of UNK UNK , and UNK of past happiness and present UNK , honest and UNK STOP
START UNK UNK , modern UNK , like UNK and UNK , is UNK only by its effects at more UNK social levels , where it is called UNK STOP
START `` UNK '' , by the way , is the term used by the critic and poet , UNK UNK , who has written several articles on this subject , the first of which , in the nation , quoted as UNK : `` we UNK STOP
START '' -- john UNK STOP
START like the UNK of UNK , like two UNK UNK UNK the entrance to one of UNK circles , stand two great dead UNK UNK -- the heroes of the UNK generation : the great UNK , UNK parker , and dylan thomas STOP
START if the word UNK means anything , both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves STOP
START both of them were overcome by the UNK of the world in which they found themselves , because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely UNK art STOP
START both of them were my friends STOP
START living in san francisco i saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not UNK by UNK or UNK STOP
START so as the years passed , i saw them each time in the light of an UNK personal UNK STOP
START the last time i saw bird , at UNK bob city , he was so gone -- so blind to the world -- that he literally sat down on me before he realized i was there STOP
START `` what happened , man '' ? ? STOP
START i said , referring to the UNK `` jazz concert '' STOP
START `` evil , man , evil '' , he said , and that's all he said for the rest of the night STOP
START about UNK he got up to UNK STOP
START the UNK crowd UNK into UNK and the UNK melody UNK through it STOP
START the last time i saw dylan , his UNK had not just passed the limits of UNK STOP
START it had assumed the UNK UNK of UNK matter STOP
START being with him was like being swept away by a UNK of falling UNK STOP
START now dylan thomas and UNK parker have a great deal more in common than the same UNK end STOP
START as artists , they were very similar STOP
START they were both very UNK STOP
START but this UNK , UNK UNK had , compared with important artists of the past , relatively little content STOP
START neither of them got very far beyond a sort of UNK UNK at his own UNK STOP
START the principal theme of UNK poetry was the UNK of birth and death -- the pain of UNK creation STOP
START music , of course , is not so explicit an art , but anybody who knew UNK parker knows that he felt much the same way about his own gift STOP
START both of them did UNK one central theme : against the UNK of the world , there is only one defense -- the creative act STOP
START this , of course , is the theme of much art -- perhaps most poetry STOP
START it is the theme of UNK , who certainly otherwise bears little UNK to parker or thomas STOP
START the difference is that UNK accepted his theme with a kind of UNK assurance STOP
START to dylan and bird it was an UNK and UNK STOP
START i do not believe that this is due to anything especially UNK about their relationship to their own UNK STOP
START i believe rather that it is due to the UNK world in which that UNK seemed to be the UNK value STOP
START UNK column of UNK verse UNK UNK enough in the UNK air of UNK rome STOP
START art may have been for him the most UNK , UNK , and UNK activity of man STOP
START but the other activities of his life UNK of these values STOP
START they did not UNK UNK them STOP
START dylan UNK verse had to find endurance in a world of burning cities and burning jews STOP
START he was able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the answer to air UNK and gas UNK STOP
START as the world began to take on the UNK of an UNK air UNK or gas UNK , i believe his art became UNK to him STOP
START i think all this could apply to parker just as well , although , because of the nature of music , it is not UNK -- at least not UNK STOP
START thomas and parker have more in common than theme , attitude , life pattern STOP
START in the practice of their art , there is an obvious technical UNK STOP
START contrary to popular belief , they were not great technical UNK STOP
START their effects are only UNK startling STOP
START thomas is a UNK from the technical UNK and UNK of writers like UNK UNK or UNK STOP
START similarly , the UNK of UNK , and of parker particularly , have been UNK UNK by people UNK with music , especially by that UNK , the intellectual UNK , the jazz UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK consist in the introduction of a few UNK used in classical music for centuries STOP
START and there is less UNK difference between progressive jazz , no matter how progressive , and UNK , than there is between two movements of many conventional UNK STOP
START what parker and his UNK -- UNK , davis , monk , UNK ( UNK is an UNK ) , UNK did was to UNK the musical UNK of the older jazz into the basic structure , of which it then became an integral part , and with which it then developed STOP
START this is true of the UNK line which could be put together from selected passages of almost anybody -- UNK UNK , johnny UNK STOP
START it is true of the UNK pattern in which the beat shifts continuously , or at least is continuously UNK , so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow the pattern to be dominated by the long UNK of the phrase or UNK STOP
START this is exactly what happened in the transition from UNK to UNK music STOP
START it is the difference between UNK and UNK STOP
START it is not a UNK analogy to say that this is what thomas did to poetry STOP
START the special UNK effects of a UNK or an UNK UNK -- actually UNK -- become the main concern STOP
START the metaphysical UNK , which UNK the reactionary generation still dominant in UNK american colleges , were UNK STOP
START UNK UNK and UNK are ends in themselves STOP
START the immediate theme , if it exists , is UNK , and his main theme -- the UNK of birth -- is simply UNK STOP
START this is one difference between bird and dylan which should be pointed out STOP
START again , contrary to popular belief , there is nothing UNK or UNK about parker either UNK or UNK STOP
START his UNK melody is a sort of naive UNK of all experience STOP
START UNK it does not UNK UNK or UNK ; ; STOP
START it UNK UNK STOP
START this is true also of a painter like jackson UNK STOP
START he may have been UNK in his behavior , but his paintings are as UNK as UNK UNK STOP
START partly this difference is due to the nature of verbal communication STOP
START the UNK UNK of the general environment UNK into even the most UNK poetry STOP
START it is much more a personal difference STOP
START thomas certainly wanted to tell people about the UNK and UNK of the world STOP
START parker and UNK wanted to substitute a work of art for the world STOP
START technique pure and simple , UNK , is not of major importance , but it is interesting that parker , following UNK young , was one of the leaders of the so-called UNK revolution STOP
START in modern jazz , the UNK is treated as a UNK and played with conventional UNK STOP
START UNK , UNK verse was extremely conventional , as was , UNK , the verse of that other tragic UNK , UNK UNK STOP
START i want to make clear what i consider the one technical development in the first wave of significant UNK arts STOP
START UNK is UNK in the UNK of structure STOP
START a poem by dylan thomas , a UNK UNK by charles parker , a painting by jackson UNK -- these are pure UNK as ends in themselves STOP
START UNK has come to determine structure STOP
START UNK UNK should be distinguished from its exact opposite -- the UNK , UNK invention of the UNK UNK , or present UNK of poetic professors STOP
START just as UNK UNK had little influence on anyone except very reactionary writers -- like UNK UNK , for instance , to whom UNK was the last word in modern poetry and the UNK of an UNK , let alone a paul UNK were UNK -- so dylan UNK influence has been slight indeed STOP
START in fact , his only UNK -- the only person to UNK his style -- was UNK , who seems to have UNK him without much understanding , and who has since moved on to other methods STOP
START UNK principal influence lay in the communication of an attitude -- that of the now UNK british romantic school of the new UNK -- henry UNK , UNK , and others -- all of whom were quite conventional poets STOP
START parker certainly had much more of an influence STOP
START at one time it was the UNK of every UNK UNK in every high school band in america to UNK like bird STOP
START even before his death this influence had begun to UNK STOP
START in fact , the whole generation of the founding fathers of UNK -- UNK , monk , davis , UNK , and the rest -- are just now at a considerable discount STOP
START the main line of development today goes back to UNK young and UNK them STOP
START the point is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts UNK are UNK , UNK STOP
START there is no longer any sense of continuing development of the sort that can be traced from UNK to UNK , or for that matter , from UNK through henry james to UNK UNK STOP
START the UNK generation before world war 1 , , and , on a lower level , the UNK of the period between the wars , both assumed an accepted universe of UNK , in which , to quote UNK UNK , it was possible to make definite advances , exactly as in the sciences STOP
START i doubt if anyone holds such ideas today STOP
START continuity UNK , but like the UNK music developed from UNK young , it is a continuity sustained by popular demand STOP
START in the plastic arts , a very similar situation exists STOP
START UNK like UNK UNK and UNK UNK might talk of creation by UNK -- of UNK pictures by walking on them with painted UNK , or by UNK UNK of paper up in the air STOP
START but it is obvious that they were UNK STOP
START nothing looks anything like an UNK or an UNK but another UNK or UNK STOP
START nothing looks less like their work than the UNK of random occasion STOP
START many of the UNK war 2 , abstract UNK , UNK of the discipline of UNK and UNK , look alike , and do look like UNK STOP
START the aesthetic appeal of pure paint laid on at random may exist , but it is a very UNK appeal STOP
START once again what has happened is an UNK UNK of the UNK , the UNK of painting STOP
START it is curious that at its best , the work of this school of painting -- mark UNK , jackson UNK , UNK still , robert UNK , UNK UNK , and the rest -- UNK nothing so much as the passage painting of quite UNK UNK : the UNK UNK in the background of a henry UNK , itself a formula derived from UNK ; ; STOP
START the UNK of light and black which UNK UNK in the UNK UNK of UNK and UNK STOP
START often work of this sort is presented as UNK -- the pure UNK of the brush UNK seeking only absolute UNK values STOP
START you have only to compare such painting with the work of , say , UNK , to realize that someone is using words and UNK UNK STOP
START at its best the abstract UNK achieve a simple UNK UNK surface STOP
START its UNK shows up immediately when compared with UNK , where the UNK rises to painting of extraordinary UNK and power STOP
START a UNK painting , however UNK , is a universe of tensions in vast depths STOP
START a UNK is an object of art -- UNK -- UNK only by its great size STOP
START in fact , once the size is big enough to cover a whole wall , it turns into nothing more than extremely expensive UNK STOP
START now there is nothing wrong with complicated UNK STOP
START there is just more to UNK STOP
START the great UNK brush UNK painted UNK , too -- at least UNK ones , UNK STOP
START a process of UNK which leaves the artist with nothing but the play of his materials themselves cannot UNK interest in either artist or public for very long STOP
START so , in the last couple of years , abstract UNK has tended toward romantic suggestion -- indications of landscape or living figures STOP
START anglo-saxon and greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly UNK account of the UNK of verse in the heroic age STOP
START UNK court UNK UNK of the UNK at UNK ( lines UNK - UNK ) , and UNK the UNK of UNK UNK in a UNK comparison of the UNK UNK with UNK ( lines UNK - UNK ) ; ; STOP
START UNK court UNK UNK of the discovered UNK of UNK and UNK ( UNK 8 UNK ) , and takes up a UNK of UNK while the UNK UNK UNK on ( UNK 8 UNK ) STOP
START nothing in all this is UNK : unlike the poets of UNK and UNK , the poet of beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ; STOP
START the poet of the UNK , UNK blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind UNK UNK STOP
START since none of these UNK of UNK without writing is intended to UNK a UNK into the epic matter , there is UNK evidence that beowulf and the homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition STOP
START that such a tradition lies behind the iliad and the UNK , at least , is hard to deny STOP
START UNK UNK UNK defended the observation that the UNK homeric poems are largely formulaic , and was led to UNK that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete UNK of greek epic UNK ; ; STOP
START he further UNK that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition , and assumed the slightly less likely UNK that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas STOP
START proceeding from UNK conclusions and UNK one of his UNK , UNK UNK , jr, UNK that beowulf likewise was created from a UNK of oral formulas UNK and extended by UNK of UNK UNK , and the UNK is striking and UNK STOP
START yet a fresh inspection will indicate one crucial UNK : beowulf and the homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent STOP
START the UNK UNK by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a very UNK oral poet , but it appears safe to assume that no sustained narrative in UNK could be composed without extreme difficulty , even in a language of many UNK UNK STOP
START UNK seems nearly as severe a UNK , although in a UNK passage william of UNK UNK that a song of UNK was UNK before the battle UNK at UNK STOP
START the anglo-saxon UNK line and the homeric UNK probably imposed less of a UNK ; ; STOP
START the verse of beowulf or of the iliad and the UNK was not easy to create but was not impossible for poets who had developed their talents UNK in UNK a UNK STOP
START yet certain aids were valuable and quite UNK necessary for UNK long UNK of verse without a UNK STOP
START the poet in a written tradition who generally never UNK a line may once in a while UNK and UNK without UNK UNK STOP
START but the oral poet cannot UNK ; ; STOP
START he must UNK continuously with no apparent effort STOP
START even though the UNK of his verse is not so great as the writing poet can manage , it is still great enough for him often to be seriously UNK unless he has aids to UNK rapid composition STOP
START the UNK poet had such aids in the UNK , which provided for the difficulties of UNK ; ; STOP
START the homeric poet had UNK , which provided for UNK needs in the UNK STOP
START either poet could quickly and easily select words or phrases to supply his immediate requirements as he UNK out his lines , because the UNK and the UNK made possible the construction of systems of numerous UNK for the chief common and proper UNK STOP
START other UNK could of course serve the same function , and for the sake of ease i shall speak of UNK and UNK in the UNK and UNK possible sense , and name , for example , UNK a UNK for the UNK STOP
START verbal and UNK elements too UNK in each epic UNK , but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large UNK and UNK supply of UNK UNK , and to UNK the members of any system of UNK as basic formulas of the poetic language STOP
START limited to a few thousand lines of heroic verse in anglo-saxon as in the other UNK UNK , we cannot say how frequently the UNK in beowulf UNK in contemporary epic on the same soil STOP
START but we can say that since a writing poet , with UNK before him , would seem UNK to UNK a technique based upon frequent and substantial UNK , the UNK like the UNK must reasonably be UNK to an oral tradition STOP
START one of the greatest UNK of our time , UNK UNK , UNK that when it is assumed the iliad and the UNK are oral poems , the UNK single UNK called UNK cannot be either UNK with or denied UNK in choice of UNK STOP
START any example of grand or UNK UNK may have been created by the poet who UNK numerous UNK into the two works we possess or may be due to one of his completely unknown UNK STOP
START the quest of the historical UNK is likely never to have further success ; ; STOP
START no individual word in the iliad or the UNK can be UNK to any one man ; ; STOP
START no UNK effective element of speech in the UNK poems can with assurance be said not to have been a commonplace in the UNK epic UNK that may have existed at the beginning of the first UNK before christ STOP
START this observation is of interest not only to students of homeric poetry but to students of anglo-saxon poetry as well STOP
START to the extent that a UNK is twice told , its final author must be suspect , although UNK in an oral tradition is less a UNK than the standard UNK UNK STOP
START UNK UNK further , and here he makes his main point , that once the iliad and the UNK are thought formulaic poems composed for an audience UNK to formulaic poetry , homeric critics are UNK of an entire UNK they previously found UNK STOP
START with a few important and a few more UNK exceptions , no expression can be deemed UNK UNK UNK for its context , because each was very probably the only expression that UNK practice and ease of rapid UNK would allow STOP
START words or phrases that UNK have UNK as UNK or UNK or humorous must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable UNK , sometimes accurate and sometimes not STOP
START this observation too may have reference to anglo-saxon poetry STOP
START to the extent that a language is formulaic , its individual components must be regarded as no more distinguished than other UNK STOP
START UNK suggests that certain UNK in beowulf were selected sometimes for UNK and sometimes for UNK UNK , but such a view would appear UNK unless it is denied that the language of beowulf is formulaic STOP
START if the master of UNK who was most responsible for the poem ever used UNK that were traditional , he was at least partly UNK of free will and not inclined towards UNK and sophisticated UNK of speech elements STOP
START once many significant phrases are found in theory or in UNK practice to provide for UNK necessity , they are not to be defended for their UNK properties in isolated UNK STOP
START it is false to be certain of having discovered in the language of beowulf such effects as UNK UNK STOP
START yet , if the argument is turned UNK , there may be found a great deal in UNK view , after all STOP
START a formulaic element need not be held UNK merely because it was selected with little conscious reflection STOP
START UNK , though the UNK expressions are , they may nevertheless be UNK or UNK or humorous STOP
START a long evolution in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of the heroic age to be based upon formulas that show the important qualities of things , and these formulas are therefore UNK rather than always actually accurate STOP
START true , we do not know how they were regarded in their day , but we need not believe the epic audience to have been more UNK to the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who have read UNK or homeric poetry all their lives and still found much to UNK in occasional UNK of the most familiar phrases STOP
START UNK and UNK in a written tradition are chosen for the UNK ; ; STOP
START in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic UNK , and tend towards UNK rather than distinctive UNK STOP
START UNK is therefore not to be placed upon the UNK UNK in an oral poem ; ; STOP
START UNK today would hope to discover the UNK UNK of UNK or the palace of UNK STOP
START a ship at UNK could be called a UNK UNK in anglo-saxon or a swift ship in greek STOP
START even when UNK of weapons the UNK would be UNK ( as their king is UNK ) and UNK would be UNK STOP
START UNK , like UNK in the UNK , is UNK the UNK of men and may accordingly be called UNK even when he stands UNK STOP
START in UNK the UNK of UNK is used deliberately and UNK , but the homeric UNK and the anglo-saxon UNK are used UNK and recall to the UNK `` a familiar story or situation or a useful or pleasant quality of the UNK '' STOP
START the epic language was not entirely the servant of the poet ; ; STOP
START it was partly his master STOP
START the UNK UNK are difficult to UNK and , except to UNK , UNK ; ; STOP
START the language , however , is a proper object of UNK , and the effects of the language are UNK even if sometimes inevitable STOP
START beowulf and the homeric poems appear oral UNK STOP
START yet they are written ; ; STOP
START at some stage in their evolution they were UNK STOP
START albert UNK suggests that the homeric poems were UNK to a UNK by a UNK who held in his mind the poems fully UNK but did not himself possess the knowledge of writing since it would be UNK to his UNK , and UNK UNK that the beowulf poet and UNK may have UNK their verse in the same fashion STOP
START this explanation is attractive , but is UNK at least in part by the observation that UNK , though he used UNK in the traditional manner , was a UNK man who four times UNK his name by UNK into his works STOP
START if UNK was UNK , the beowulf poet may have been also , and so may the final UNK of the iliad and the UNK STOP
START in UNK of the UNK to the blind or UNK UNK , one may conceive of a man who heard a vast store of oral poetry UNK , and became UNK familiar with the established aids to UNK , and himself wrote his own UNK or his edition of the UNK of the past STOP
START other theories of origin are compatible with the formulaic theory : beowulf may contain a design for UNK , and the iliad may have a vast UNK pattern UNK to a UNK pattern produced during the geometric period in pottery STOP
START the account of the growth and final UNK of these UNK rests partly , however , upon the degree to which they were formulaic STOP
START carl UNK UNK counted UNK different lines repeated exactly in the two homeric poems , and by increasing this figure so as to include lines repeated with very slight UNK he counted UNK different lines used a total of UNK times STOP
START thus one line in five from the iliad and the UNK is to be found UNK else in the two poems STOP
START the ratio is thoroughly remarkable , because the lines are so long -- half again as long as those of beowulf STOP
START anglo-saxon poetry appears to have no comparable amount of UNK ; ; STOP
START there is no reason to think that the UNK used and UNK whole lines and even UNK passages after the manner of his homeric UNK STOP
START in determining the extent to which any poem is formulaic it is UNK , however , to UNK nothing besides lines repeated in their UNK , for a stock of UNK would be sufficient to permit the poet to UNK with UNK if they provided for UNK needs STOP
START the UNK UNK is UNK to the anglo-saxon UNK and the homeric UNK ; ; STOP
START if any words or phrases are formulaic , they will be STOP
START the iliad has two words for the UNK , UNK and UNK STOP
START recent criticism of great expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and UNK content , to show , as UNK has said of dickens generally , that much of the UNK impact UNK in its `` UNK insight and moral UNK '' STOP
START UNK excellent chapter on great expectations has UNK illustrated how UNK that novel can be read from such a perspective STOP
START in his analysis , however , he UNK upon but UNK to UNK an idea , generally UNK in discussions of the book , which i believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a UNK feature of the narrative STOP
START this essay UNK to make that exploration STOP
START dickens was not for nothing the most UNK of the great UNK writers STOP
START he knew UNK that next to voice and face an UNK hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable UNK for UNK character and UNK action and response STOP
START it is hardly UNK , therefore , that many of his most vivid figures do UNK or UNK things with their hands STOP
START in great expectations the hands become almost an UNK STOP
START UNK UNK UNK his UNK , a gesture which UNK both UNK and the UNK UNK that half UNK , half UNK all who have UNK with him STOP
START miss UNK UNK hands , heavy as if her UNK were somehow concentrated in them , move in UNK UNK between her broken heart and her walking stick STOP
START UNK `` UNK '' is the UNK extended UNK hand STOP
START UNK reveals his UNK by regularly UNK his hands together STOP
START old UNK UNK response to life UNK with a UNK , UNK wife is to `` put his two hands into his disturbed hair '' and `` make an extraordinary effort to UNK himself up by it '' , whereas joe UNK UNK the UNK UNK of UNK by UNK drawing `` the back of his hand across and across his nose '' STOP
START such UNK would be less worthy of remark , were it not that in great expectations , as in no other of UNK novels , hands serve as a UNK of plot and theme -- a kind of UNK symbol or natural UNK for the UNK complex of human UNK and the values and attitudes that UNK them STOP
START dickens not only reveals character through gesture , he makes hands a crucial element of the plot , a means of UNK the structure of the novel by helping to define the UNK relations with all the major characters , and a device for ordering such diverse UNK as guilt , UNK , crime , UNK , education , UNK , UNK ( by both people and institutions ) , friendship , romantic love , UNK , and UNK STOP
START we have only to think of lady UNK or the UNK in thomas UNK famous story , `` the hands of UNK '' , to realize that hands often call up ideas of crime and punishment STOP
START so it is with great expectations , whether the hands be UNK as he strikes down UNK or pip's as he UNK a pie from her UNK STOP
START such associations suit well with the UNK or UNK aspects of UNK novel , but , on a deeper plane , they UNK to the UNK of sin , guilt , and UNK that have recently been analyzed by other critics STOP
START the novel UNK with a UNK UNK UNK trying to avoid the UNK of being `` laid hands on '' -- a mysterious figure who looks into pip's UNK eyes in the UNK `` as if he were UNK the hands of the dead people , UNK up UNK out of their UNK , to get a twist upon his UNK and pull him in '' STOP
START UNK UNK pip into UNK a UNK pie for him by creating the image in the UNK imagination of a UNK man who may `` UNK UNK his way to him and UNK him open '' , `` UNK his hands '' in him STOP
START as pip UNK over the UNK that his own hands have committed , his guilty conscience projects itself upon the wooden finger of a local UNK , UNK it into `` a UNK UNK me to the UNK '' STOP
START held UNK down in the UNK , pip UNK in UNK `` with both hands '' to his UNK ; ; STOP
START later he UNK in UNK from the family table just as his UNK is about to be discovered and is UNK at the front door by a soldier who UNK holds out a pair of UNK which he has brought to UNK UNK for UNK STOP
START through such details dickens indicates at the UNK that guilt is a part of the UNK bond between pip and UNK which is so UNK to UNK both their lives STOP
START since they commonly UNK thoughts and feelings into UNK , hands naturally represent action , and since nearly half the characters in great expectations are of the UNK or closely UNK to it , the UNK of hands with crime or violence is not to be UNK at STOP

START lacking guidance , industry UNK its own areas STOP
START the result , coupled with the UNK for which american industry is famous , is considerable UNK of funds and efforts in marginal areas STOP
START an over-all concept will guide industry where available talents and facilities will yield greatest UNK STOP
START therefore , a broad concept of over-all submarine defense is needed for UNK of the UNK efforts , for a logical presentation to the public , for industry's guidance , and as a basis for a program to the congress STOP
START principles involved in an over-all concept STOP
START that which follows will be a discussion of principles and possible content for an over-all concept of UNK warfare STOP
START russia UNK the UNK of submarines in the world , divided between her various UNK STOP
START some are also in UNK and others are on loan to egypt STOP
START other countries which may UNK or UNK become communist can furnish bases STOP
START communist target areas can be assumed , but there is no certainty that such assumptions UNK with soviet UNK STOP
START attack can come from almost any direction against many locations STOP
START UNK , then , the first principle of the plan must be that it is not UNK UNK toward any geographical area STOP
START it is often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while building , at bases , in transit , and on station STOP
START destruction of the UNK building and base complex , however , requires UNK on enemy territory , which is possible only in event of UNK UNK STOP
START in transit or on station , it may not be possible to attack the submarines until commission of an UNK act STOP
START the communists are UNK at UNK UNK short of general war and will do so whenever it is to their advantage STOP
START therefore the second principle of the plan must be that , while providing for UNK UNK , its effectiveness is not dependent on general war STOP
START UNK warfare does not involve UNK between large opposing forces , with the decision a result of a single battle STOP
START it is a war of UNK , of single actions , of an exchange of losses STOP
START this exchange must result in our ending up with some effective units STOP
START initially , having fewer units of some elements -- especially submarines -- than the UNK , our capabilities need to be sufficiently greater than theirs , so that the exchange will be in our favor STOP
START therefore , the third principle of the plan must be that it does not depend for effectiveness on UNK by the same types , unless at an assured favorable exchange rate STOP
START the submarine has increased its effectiveness by several orders of magnitude since world war 2 STOP
START its speed has increased , it UNK at increasingly greater depths , its UNK endurance is becoming unlimited , and it will become even more UNK STOP
START the next developments will probably be in UNK STOP
START the missile can gradually be expected to replace the UNK STOP
START as detection UNK increase , weapons will be developed to attack other submarines and surface UNK at these UNK STOP
START therefore , the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously increasing capabilities in the UNK STOP
START no element can accomplish the total objective of submarine defense STOP
START some elements support the others , but all have limitations STOP
START some limitations of one element can be UNK for by a capability of another STOP
START elements used in combination will increase the over-all capability more than the sum of the capabilities of the individual elements STOP
START therefore , the UNK fifth principle must be that it UNK on the capabilities of all elements in combination STOP
START UNK the submarine defense problem can be solved by sufficient forces STOP
START numbers would be UNK and current fiscal policies make this an UNK solution STOP
START UNK , aircraft procurement , and weapon programs indicate that there will not be enough of anything STOP
START therefore , any measures taken in UNK which will decrease force requirements in war will contribute greatly to success when UNK occur STOP
START therefore , the sixth principle of the plan must be that it UNK on current measures which will reduce future force requirements STOP
START the world is constantly changing ; ; STOP
START what was new UNK is UNK today STOP
START the seventh principle of the plan is UNK ; ; STOP
START it must be flexible enough to allow for technological UNK , scientific progress , and changes in world conditions STOP
START supporting elements in UNK operations STOP
START to this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense has been demonstrated , the mission has been stated , broad principles UNK its content laid down , and the supporting elements listed STOP
START before considering these elements in more detail , an additional requirement should be stated STOP
START large area coverage will accomplish all other tasks STOP
START therefore , because reduction in tasks results in reduction of forces required , the plan should provide for expanding area coverage STOP
START but it must be remembered that the plan should not be UNK UNK STOP
START consequently , the system giving area coverage ( if such coverage is less than world wide ) must be flexible and hence at least partially mobile STOP
START since effective area coverage appears fairly remote , the requirement can be UNK in mind while considering the elements : air , surface , UNK , fixed installations , mines , and intelligence STOP
START these are arranged approximately in the order of the UNK of their UNK but will be discussed in the reverse order in the hope that the true order of importance will result STOP
START intelligence , as used UNK , will include information on possible UNK and on the environment which can affect operations STOP
START these can be referred to as operational intelligence and UNK intelligence STOP
START in submarine defense these must have maximum stress STOP
START good operational intelligence can UNK sound planning , greatly reduce force requirements , and increase UNK effectiveness STOP
START UNK intelligence is just as important STOP
START the ocean presently UNK with the target STOP
START full knowledge of the science of UNK can bring the environment to our side , resulting in an increase in effectiveness of equipment and tactics , a decrease in enemy capabilities , and the development of methods of UNK on the environment STOP
START therefore , improved intelligence will result in reduced force requirements and , as it UNK all other elements , rates a top UNK STOP
START gathering intelligence is important , but of equal importance is its translation into UNK form STOP
START a program is needed to UNK the results of UNK research into UNK and operating instructions STOP
START approaching this problem on a statistical basis is UNK , because the UNK has the same sources available and will be encountered not under average conditions , but under the conditions most UNK to him STOP
START therefore , the UNK commander must have detailed operating instructions based on measurement of conditions , in the area , at the time of encounter STOP
START all capabilities must be used to maximum advantage then STOP
START temperature , wind , oxygen content , depth , bottom character , and animal life are the chief UNK variables STOP
START there may be others STOP
START variations in sound velocity should be measured rather than temperature , because more of the variables would be UNK STOP
START these variations must eventually be measured UNK as well as UNK STOP
START progress in UNK water conditions is encouraging , but little guidance is available to the man at sea on the use of such information STOP
START a UNK effort is needed to make UNK data useful on the spot STOP
START mine warfare has in the past been directed against surface targets STOP
START by its nature it has always been of great psychological advantage and small efforts have required considerably greater UNK STOP
START mines are being increasingly UNK against submarine targets STOP
START they are still considered to be for use in UNK waters , however , and targets must come within a few yards of them STOP
START mines need to be recognized as a major element in UNK warfare employment , extended to deep water , and have their effective area per unit increased STOP
START mines can be used to deny access to great areas ; ; STOP
START they are difficult to UNK , cost little to maintain until required , and can be put into place quickly STOP
START a most attractive feature is that detection and attack are combined in a single package STOP
START effective employment will reduce force requirements STOP
START for example , effective mine UNK from UNK to cuba and across the UNK channel from cuba to mexico would remove all requirements for harbor defense , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , shipping control , and mine defense for the entire UNK of mexico STOP
START more extended systems , covering all passage into the UNK , would free the UNK and the UNK of mexico from the previously listed requirements STOP
START systems covering the UNK of UNK and possibly the entire UNK of the united states are not impossible STOP
START such mine defense systems could permit concentration of mobile forces in the open UNK with UNK increase in the probability of success STOP
START the advantages inherent in mine warfare justify as great an importance for this element as is UNK any of the other elements STOP
START fixed installations are increasingly UNK as the problem of area defense UNK STOP
START the UNK are scientific and technical men who exercise considerable influence on their military counterparts STOP
START systems which UNK submarines over wide areas are attractive , although they can be only `` UNK UNK '' STOP
START mobile forces are required to UNK and attack detected targets , since the systems are not capable of UNK a target STOP
START such systems are expensive and are UNK UNK STOP
START in an over-all UNK concept , dependence on and effort UNK for such systems should be limited to those with UNK capabilities STOP
START no general installation should be made until a model installation has been proved and its maximum capability determined STOP
START in addition , proposals for fixed installations should be carefully weighed against a UNK mobile system STOP
START fixed installations will always lack the flexibility that should be inherent in naval systems STOP
START the submarine has become increasingly attractive as an UNK weapon system STOP
START it UNK in its UNK environment , and any advantage gained UNK by the target is shared by the UNK STOP
START but the submarine is a weapon of UNK and therefore always in danger of being UNK STOP
START two UNK ( 1 , and 2 ) ) of UNK UNK ( UNK ) which act as UNK for the UNK of UNK by UNK UNK are UNK from aj STOP
START the 7 UNK of UNK are incorporated directly into UNK 2 ( ( as shown with both UNK and UNK af ) STOP
START UNK of the UNK carbon atoms arise from aj STOP
START all UNK UNK of UNK 1 ( ( a product of UNK UNK UNK of 2 ) arise from aj STOP
START UNK 1 , isolated from the medium , however , showed a lower specific activity , which indicates UNK synthesis of this UNK STOP
START vigorous UNK UNK of UNK 1 , destroyed the biological activity of the UNK and UNK two UNK UNK STOP

START -- research on UNK in UNK sera was continued STOP
START one of the most interesting findings was the extreme sensitivity of plasma UNK to rare earth UNK STOP
START the UNK of the UNK by very low UNK of UNK UNK is probably the strongest known biological effect of rare earth UNK STOP
START various metal UNK have been found to protect plasma UNK against UNK by UNK and UNK STOP
START the effects can be related to the structure of this UNK STOP
START the UNK of serum and red blood cell UNK was also established STOP
START furthermore , the UNK of UNK was studied in UNK sera , and it was found that it is UNK by UNK ( or a factor attached to it ) in addition to UNK STOP
START selective UNK can distinguish the two activities STOP
START investigations on the acceleration of human plasma UNK were carried further STOP
START ( UNK , UNK , UNK ) UNK studies on modified UNK proteins STOP

START it was observed that UNK UNK are the same diameter ( 15 UNK but much longer ( up to several UNK ) than UNK UNK STOP
START this unusual UNK also was shown to UNK a UNK thermal phase transformation STOP

START -- in a UNK study of seed proteins , the UNK of the UNK UNK have been investigated STOP
START in addition to the known principal UNK , UNK , three other UNK distinct components have been observed STOP
START a UNK protein of quite low molecular weight ( UNK ) has also been found in this system and partly characterized STOP
START ( UNK , UNK ) STOP
START UNK mechanics and UNK STOP
START theory of UNK fluids STOP
START -- on the basis of a UNK assumption in function space , it is possible to prove that , for materials having the property that the stress is given by a functional of the history of the UNK UNK , the classical theory of UNK UNK is valid when the UNK has been UNK for all times in the past STOP
START by UNK the UNK assumption , it has been possible to derive second and higher order theories of UNK STOP
START in the UNK theory , one of the normal stress differences can be calculated from the UNK stress UNK function STOP
START ( UNK with walter UNK , department of mathematics , UNK institute of technology ) UNK measurements STOP
START -- an extensive series of measurements was made on a UNK UNK in a UNK UNK instrument using forced UNK UNK , free UNK , and UNK measurements over the temperature range of af to UNK STOP
START as many as seven decades of the time scale were thus covered UNK STOP
START the simple UNK UNK valid for many UNK systems did not hold here STOP
START it was possible , however , to UNK the UNK into a sum of a UNK component and two UNK mechanisms , each compatible with the UNK UNK principle and with a consistent set of UNK UNK factors STOP
START ( UNK UNK , UNK , UNK UNK ) STOP
START UNK STOP
START trace elements in UNK , UNK , and related materials STOP
START -- the results of UNK of UNK ( natural glasses of unknown origin ) for UNK and UNK have shown that these glasses are probably produced from UNK ( or less likely from UNK ) matter by impact of a UNK body STOP
START the UNK UNK ratio is higher than that for ordinary UNK , UNK , or UNK matter as a result of selective UNK of the components of the UNK STOP
START UNK UNK is less UNK than UNK ( the main UNK of UNK ) and UNK UNK is more UNK STOP
START UNK ( UNK from UNK ) give the appearance of a second melting STOP
START in conformity with this conclusion a higher trace UNK content was found in the portion ( UNK ) that has UNK a second melting STOP
START the UNK fractions of UNK UNK show UNK UNK ratios similar to those of UNK because they too have UNK melting at some point in their UNK STOP
START UNK desert UNK , another natural glass , is composed of nearly pure UNK and has the same trace UNK content as UNK in the area STOP
START the UNK content , however , has been UNK UNK STOP
START this glass is probably formed from UNK desert UNK by UNK or UNK impact STOP
START UNK UNK with sufficient UNK energy to produce large UNK UNK UNK may nevertheless UNK only small UNK of material STOP
START most of the impact energy is spent in UNK and UNK STOP
START when rapid UNK follows melting , impact glasses may result STOP
START these always contain UNK UNK STOP
START impact glasses not containing UNK UNK may have been produced by UNK UNK or UNK STOP
START no UNK have ever been UNK from UNK UNK , and recent UNK containing impact glass have all been produced by UNK UNK with the exception of UNK UNK , UNK , western UNK desert STOP

START inorganic chemistry STOP
START preparation of a coordination UNK is often accomplished by the simple method of UNK a metal salt with a UNK in a suitable UNK such as an UNK STOP
START by applying this general principle , a great number of complex compounds of UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK , with UNK , UNK , and UNK have been obtained in this laboratory during the past few years STOP
START ( UNK UNK , UNK , UNK ) in the absence of direct evidence to the contrary , decomposition of UNK UNK and coordination of its UNK to the metal were not considered , following the above UNK assumption in UNK coordination chemistry STOP
START recent work with UNK and UNK UNK as UNK , however , has given evidence that UNK and UNK UNK may be readily formed by reaction with UNK in some of these systems STOP
START some of the previously reported compounds have thus been UNK and a series of new UNK and UNK compounds discovered , the more representative examples being af , af , af , af and af ( af ) STOP
START the coordination UNK formed by transition UNK with primary and secondary UNK and UNK are being investigated ( UNK ) STOP
START particular interest is directed towards the UNK of these UNK with metal UNK to form substituted UNK or UNK UNK STOP

START structure and properties of UNK STOP
START UNK of UNK networks STOP
START -- the theory of UNK of UNK networks has been developed on a more general basis and the UNK of state relating variables of pressure , volume , temperature , stress and strain have been precisely formulated STOP
START simple UNK has been treated in detail STOP
START the various UNK UNK for UNK of volume and strain , UNK of pressure and strain , and UNK of pressure and length have been UNK STOP
START the UNK accompanying UNK and the simultaneously developed UNK of UNK have been related to the UNK STOP
START in continuation of these theoretical studies , a more precise UNK of the effects of UNK in network structure is sought STOP
START ( UNK , UNK ) chain UNK of UNK UNK STOP
START -- recent theoretical work to UNK the dimensions of UNK UNK by UNK and UNK has been extended to include more general types of UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK distance of the UNK chain has been calculated in reasonable agreement with values UNK from UNK data STOP
START these studies are being extended to different UNK to increase our knowledge about the UNK to UNK around chain bonds STOP
START ( UNK , UNK ) UNK in UNK and UNK STOP
START -- the UNK of UNK UNK af units UNK with a minor percentage of af is limited by the inability of the crystal UNK characteristic of the former to UNK the UNK side group of the latter STOP
START only UNK UNK of the former are UNK for formation of UNK STOP
START limitations on the lengths of these UNK UNK the stability of the comparatively short UNK which can be formed , and this is reflected in a UNK of the melting range STOP
START ( robert UNK , UNK , UNK ) carefully UNK melting studies on this system ( UNK ) permit UNK UNK of the UNK UNK by reduced UNK length STOP
START the complex UNK of UNK UNK is necessarily dependent on the same factor STOP
START hence , the present studies offer a possible basis for UNK in the latter field STOP
START contraction of muscle STOP
START -- UNK muscle , in the presence of the physiological agent ( UNK ) responsible for UNK energy to the UNK active proteins of muscle , has been shown to UNK a contraction which is highly sensitive both to temperature and to UNK composition in UNK of UNK and water STOP
START experiments carried out over long periods of time in order to allow establishment of a steady state have shown that the onset of contraction and its completion are confined to an interval of several degrees UNK and to a concentration range of only several per cent STOP
START the contraction therefore UNK of the character of a phase transition STOP
START while UNK appears to be necessary for the occurrence of contraction , its presence and UNK UNK of it by the muscle protein UNK are not the only UNK for contraction STOP
START ( UNK , UNK ) UNK UNK STOP
START -- one of the principal aims of UNK UNK techniques is the synthesis of UNK of extremely narrow molecular weight distribution STOP
START a simple process for the preparation of nearly UNK UNK of UNK molecular weight has been developed STOP
START the preparation of such products is not new , but the systems UNK employed in UNK have UNK considerable experimental skill and starting materials of a high UNK STOP
START in the new process UNK present in the UNK ( UNK ) , the UNK , and in the reaction system which would cause UNK of UNK centers , are rendered UNK prior to UNK by gradual addition of UNK , a mixture of UNK and UNK UNK , at a temperature low enough to UNK chain growth STOP
START upon completion of the UNK step , additional UNK appropriate for the molecular weight of the sample desired is added , and the system is then UNK to the UNK temperature , at which the reaction is allowed to go to completion STOP
START the UNK of the molecular weights was found to be within UNK for the UNK prepared , with af ratios less than UNK STOP
START contrary to observations with UNK , no apparent change of the reactivity of the chain ends takes place over considerable periods of time in UNK as UNK STOP

START because individual classes of foods differ in their requirements for preservation , a number of methods have been developed over the years involving one or a combination of procedures such as UNK , UNK , UNK , chemical treatment , UNK , refrigeration , and UNK STOP
START the basic objectives in each instance are to make available supplies of food during the intervals between UNK or UNK , to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and insects , and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of UNK or production to areas of consumption STOP
START in earlier years , the preservation of food was essentially related to survival STOP
START in the more sophisticated atmosphere of today's developed nations , UNK techniques have sought also to bring variety , peak UNK , and optimum taste and flavor in foods at reasonable cost to the consumer STOP
START with the development of nuclear technology , UNK materials , and machine radiation sources in recent years , the possibilities of applying UNK radiation to the preservation of foods attracted the attention of investigators in the united states and throughout the world STOP
START an early hope that UNK might be the ultimate answer to practically all food preservation problems was soon UNK STOP
START interest remained , however , in the possibility that it would serve as a useful UNK method for UNK UNK losses and for UNK some foods at lower over-all costs than UNK , or without UNK heat or UNK with their UNK taste UNK STOP
START factors responsible for the UNK of foods STOP
START the chief factors responsible for the UNK of fresh UNK are ( 1 ) microorganisms such as UNK , UNK , and UNK , ( 2 ) enzymes , ( 3 ) insects , ( 4 ) UNK , and ( 5 ) chemical reactions STOP
START microorganisms are often responsible for the rapid UNK of foods STOP
START of special concern is the growth of UNK such as UNK UNK which UNK UNK products STOP
START UNK action in stored food produces changes which can UNK affect the appearance of food or its UNK STOP
START UNK by chemical action results from the reaction of one group of components in the food with others or with its environment , as in UNK of the walls of metal UNK or the reaction of UNK with oxygen in the air to produce UNK STOP
START UNK is a naturally occurring phenomenon in stored UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , and similar root vegetables STOP
START insect UNK is a problem of importance chiefly in stored grain STOP
START the presence of UNK UNK such as UNK UNK in UNK UNK another factor which must be dealt with in food processing STOP
START to permit the storage of food for long periods of time , a method of preservation must accomplish the destruction of microorganisms and UNK of UNK action STOP
START the term `` UNK '' applies to methods involving essentially complete destruction of all microorganisms STOP
START food treated in this manner and protected from UNK by UNK methods of UNK and UNK presumably could be stored for long periods without refrigeration STOP
START the process of `` UNK '' involves UNK and less prolonged heat treatment which UNK the destruction of most , but not all , of the microorganisms STOP
START less severe thermal treatment as by UNK or UNK serves to UNK enzymes STOP
START general effects of UNK radiation STOP
START UNK radiation can cause the destruction of microorganisms and insects involved in food UNK or , at lower UNK , can UNK their action STOP
START it UNK a means of destroying insects in stored grain products as well as certain UNK UNK present in meats STOP
START UNK of enzymes is also possible , although some types require extremely heavy UNK of 10 UNK or more STOP
START because of UNK UNK , UNK , colors , and generally low UNK associated with radiation treatment of this magnitude , the UNK of enzymes is best accomplished prior to UNK by the conventional UNK methods of UNK STOP
START radiation does not UNK the chemical UNK of food STOP
START it will , however , UNK the UNK of UNK and other root vegetables STOP
START the radiation UNK required for the preservation of foods are in the following UNK : 1 STOP
START for UNK , to destroy all UNK for long-term preservation -- about UNK UNK for UNK foods of low salt content STOP
START 2 STOP
START for UNK , to partially destroy microorganisms ; ; STOP
START results vary with types of food , storage conditions , and objectives of treatment -- commonly of the order of UNK UNK but up to about UNK aj STOP
START 3 STOP
START for destruction of insects -- about UNK aj STOP
START 4 STOP
START for UNK the UNK of root vegetables -- UNK to 10,000 aj STOP
START UNK foods with UNK radiation leads to some UNK side effects , particularly at the higher radiation UNK STOP
START in this respect , the general UNK and individual acceptance of most UNK foods has , to date , been found to be low in comparison with fresh and UNK processed foods STOP
START a number of foods are quite acceptable as UNK taste and UNK , however , at UNK substantially less than UNK levels STOP
START moreover , the UNK value of UNK foods apparently UNK little , if any , change , although some of the UNK UNK are affected by UNK UNK STOP
START radiation sources STOP
START for UNK of food , the results obtained depend upon the UNK rather than the specific type of radiation , and x-ray , UNK , and UNK electron radiation are suitable STOP
START aside from availability and economic considerations , each has certain practical advantages ; ; STOP
START for example , UNK UNK give deeper penetration but cannot be UNK or UNK , whereas UNK electron beams may be split and directed to both the top and bottom of the food package to be UNK STOP
START selection of a source for commercial UNK would involve consideration of numerous factors including required UNK rate , load factor , UNK , UNK , safety , and most important , costs STOP
START of the UNK useful sources of UNK UNK , UNK sources , UNK , UNK , UNK products , or a UNK UNK loop system using a material such as an UNK salt have received most attention for UNK systems STOP
START of the various particle UNK , the van de UNK machines , UNK UNK , and linear UNK are the principal ones available for commercial use STOP
START costs of the effective energy produced by these sources is a major UNK in the development of UNK processes STOP
START estimated production costs of radiation energy from machine and UNK sources range from UNK to UNK per aj STOP
START conventional energy for processing foods is available in the range of at most a few cents per UNK for electric power and the equivalent of a few mills per UNK for process UNK STOP
START radiation , therefore , is at an initial cost UNK even though only 1 to 10 per cent as much radiation energy as heat energy is required for UNK or UNK STOP
START what are the possibilities of UNK radiation production costs for the future ? ? STOP
START it has been estimated that for applications on a UNK scale costs might reach values in the neighborhood of 10 cents per UNK for UNK UNK or for UNK radiation UNK in a UNK core STOP
START no comparable UNK in the cost of UNK radiation are UNK STOP
START such UNK , however , appear highly UNK and the UNK involved are far beyond those UNK for UNK facilities STOP
START because agricultural activities are UNK and the areas of production and UNK of many foods are widely scattered UNK , and because of the high cost of UNK UNK food items any substantial distance to a central processing location , the use of large central processing stations , where UNK radiation facilities approaching the UNK range might be UNK , is UNK UNK STOP
START present status of UNK preservation of foods STOP
START the objective of complete UNK of foods is to produce a UNK and UNK product capable of being stored without refrigeration for extended periods of time STOP
START chief interest in UNK UNK in the military services STOP
START for them , providing UNK food under battle or emergency conditions is a UNK consideration STOP
START they require completely UNK foods capable of being stored without refrigeration , preferably items already UNK and ready to eat STOP
START high UNK value , variety , UNK , and UNK appearance are important for reasons of UNK STOP
START foods for rear stations , which require cooking , but no refrigeration , are also of interest STOP
START of primary interest are meats STOP
START UNK , which produces fewer UNK UNK changes in food products , has potential UNK in UNK the keeping qualities of fresh and UNK food items STOP
START thus , food so processed might reach more remote markets and permit the consumer to enjoy more produce at peak UNK and UNK STOP
START commercial interest is chiefly in this type of treatment , as is military interest under UNK conditions STOP
START the present status of food preservation by UNK radiation is discussed by food classes in the following paragraphs STOP
START meats STOP
START the radiation processing of meat has received extensive investigation STOP
START to date , the one meat showing favorable results at UNK UNK is UNK STOP
START of particular interest to the military services is the demonstration that UNK UNK , after UNK , is superior in UNK to available UNK UNK products STOP
START tests with beef have been largely UNK because of the development of UNK STOP
START a prime objective of the army UNK corps program is to find the reasons for UNK low UNK and means of UNK it , since it is a major and desirable UNK item STOP
START partly because UNK heat treatment is needed to UNK enzymes before UNK , treated fresh meats have the appearance of UNK or UNK meat STOP
START UNK is a less severe problem with the UNK of meats , but problems of commercial UNK remain STOP
START moderate radiation UNK of from UNK to UNK UNK can extend the UNK life ( at UNK f ) of fresh beef from 5 days to 5 or 6 weeks STOP
START however , the problem of consumer UNK remains STOP
START the UNK UNK process UNK the treated beef and liquid UNK in UNK cuts STOP
START UNK beef UNK in the absence of oxygen UNK an UNK UNK color STOP
START when UNK and UNK are UNK at UNK UNK , the meat becomes UNK , the fat becomes UNK , and , again , UNK changes in color occur STOP
START ground meats such as fresh UNK UNK and UNK have a relatively short UNK life under refrigeration , and UNK might be thought to offer UNK improved keeping qualities STOP
START however , a major problem here is one of scale of processing ; ; STOP
START ground meats are usually prepared from UNK meats at the local level , whereas UNK at economic volumes of production would require central processing and distribution facilities STOP
START the problems of color change by UNK and liquid UNK within the package are the same as for solid cuts STOP
START UNK UNK items containing meat UNK , as in `` frozen UNK '' might offer a potential use for UNK STOP
START the principal potential advantage would be that the finished product could be UNK and stored at lower cost under refrigeration instead of being frozen STOP
START a UNK item could also be heated and served in less time than is required for frozen foods of the same type STOP
START competitive processes for UNK meats are by UNK and UNK STOP
START costs of UNK meat are in the range of UNK to 5 cents per pound ; ; STOP
START costs of UNK are in the area of 2 to UNK cents per pound STOP
START the table on page 10 shows costs of UNK and UNK meat , and estimated costs for UNK under certain assumed conditions STOP
START under the conditions of comparison , it will be noted that : ( 1 ) STOP
START UNK ( at 3 UNK ) is more expensive than UNK , particularly for the UNK source STOP
START ( 2 ) STOP
START UNK by either the electron UNK or UNK source is in the range of UNK costs STOP
START ( 3 ) STOP
START UNK using the UNK source is more expensive than use of an electron UNK STOP
START UNK STOP
START results of UNK tests with UNK have been quite successful STOP
START at UNK UNK , good UNK results , with a minimum of changes in appearance , taste , and UNK STOP
START UNK has also been successful , and the UNK life of chicken can be extended to a month or more under UNK storage as compared with about 10 days for the UNK product STOP
START acceptable taste and UNK are retained by the UNK and UNK chicken STOP
START acceptance of UNK is likely to be delayed , however , for two reasons : ( 1 ) the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration is becoming a minimal problem because of constantly improved UNK and UNK practices , and ( 2 ) treatment by UNK , a measure already approved by the federal food and drug administration , serves to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about UNK cents per pound STOP
START UNK STOP
START fresh UNK products are extremely UNK STOP
START although refrigeration has served to extend the storage life of these products , substantially increased consumption might be possible if areas remote from the UNK could be served adequately STOP
START furthermore , it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms possible STOP
START the instrument is shown in fig1 and consists essentially of a hard , sharp , UNK UNK knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating STOP
START the force required to accomplish removal is UNK , by means of an electronic UNK , against distance of removal STOP
START since the removal force is a function of coating thickness , a differential UNK UNK has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness STOP
START this , too , is recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut STOP
START a number of adjustment features are included in the UNK to UNK measurement and permit ready removal of coatings UNK on such UNK as iron and other UNK , glass , wood , and plastic surfaces STOP
START the measurement of UNK on UNK can also readily be carried out STOP
START UNK results have been found to compare UNK with UNK knife UNK tests STOP
START the UNK method , however , is about 100 times more sensitive and UNK numerical results which can be accurately repeated at will over a period of time STOP
START if a UNK coating of increasing thickness is removed from a substrate by an instrument like the UNK with a knife of constant UNK angle , a number of removal mechanisms are often observed which depend upon the thickness of the coating STOP
START at low UNK a cutting ( or UNK ) phenomenon is often encountered STOP
START as the coating becomes UNK , the cutting may UNK change to a cracking type of failure STOP
START if the coating becomes still UNK , a UNK type failure finally can occur STOP
START the typical appearance of these various mechanisms is illustrated in UNK , 3 , and 4 , which are single frame UNK of high speed movies taken during the course of the knife removal process STOP
START it can be seen from UNK that the cutting removal of a coating from its substrate involves pure cohesive failure of the coating STOP
START the molecular forces holding the coating to the substrate are obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and failure occurs by shear along a plane starting at the tip of the knife and extending to the coating surface STOP
START the pictures of UNK and 4 show the cracking and UNK types of removal where the coating is UNK by failure in a region at , or close to , the UNK between coating and substrate STOP
START if the force required to remove the coatings is UNK against film thickness , a graph as illustrated UNK in UNK may UNK result STOP
START here , h is the coatings removal force measured parallel to the surface of the substrate and t is the film thickness STOP
START it can be seen that the force is characteristic of the removal process and changes UNK from cutting to cracking to UNK removal STOP
START also , it can be readily seen that the cutting and UNK types of failure show a steady state response , while the cracking mechanism is of a dynamic nature STOP
START it should be UNK that these three mechanisms can occur on the same coating UNK upon the same substrate merely as a function of changes in coatings thickness STOP
START presumably the UNK bond strength and gross cohesive properties are identical in each case STOP
START what then , are the factors that contribute to these phenomena ? ? STOP
START why should the `` practical UNK '' of a coating as UNK by a knife method change , initially increasing rather rapidly and then UNK UNK to very low values as the knife is forced through a coating of increasing thickness ? ? STOP
START cutting mechanism of cohesive failure STOP
START the cutting ( or UNK ) removal process has been previously described STOP
START it was found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely by cohesive failure STOP
START the details of the removal process are shown UNK in UNK STOP
START the various forces result from the reaction of the removed paint UNK against the face of the knife and along the shear plane , which makes an angle UNK with the substrate STOP
START the action and reaction forces are r and af , respectively , and are equal and opposite in direction STOP
START all the other force UNK are derived from these STOP
START af is the force required to cut a coating of thickness t from the substrate STOP
START af is the shear force along the shear plane ; ; STOP
START af and af are the UNK forces acting against coating and knife , respectively ; ; STOP
START af is the normal UNK force acting on the shear plane ; ; STOP
START af is the friction force between UNK and knife surfaces , and p is the normal force acting on the face of the knife STOP
START UNK is the UNK angle of the knife ; ; STOP
START UNK is the angle the shear plane makes with the substrate ; ; STOP
START UNK is the friction angle ; ; STOP
START and UNK is the angle the UNK make with the plane of the substrate STOP
START an analysis of the vector relationships shows that the UNK angle UNK and the friction angle UNK determine the vector direction af of the force UNK r and af STOP
START consequently , both the UNK angle of the knife as well as the friction occurring between the back of the removed coating and the front of the knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting removal process STOP
START it is difficult to measure the direction and magnitude of r directly STOP
START in actual practice , the values most readily UNK to measurement are the cutting force af and the shear angle aj STOP
START these two values and the UNK angle UNK are sufficient to determine the other UNK of these relationships STOP
START UNK is defined by the UNK of the knife ; ; STOP
START UNK can readily be determined by measuring the thickness of the coating before and after cutting from the substrate ; ; STOP
START af is UNK determined STOP
START from UNK the relationship between these UNK can readily be derived and the cutting force is af where UNK is the shear strength of the coating and is a UNK of the coatings material , UNK is the width of the removed coating and t is its thickness STOP
START if the cutting force , af , is UNK against film thickness , a straight line should result passing through the origin and having slope af STOP
START however , in the actual assessment of the cutting force by UNK methods for any thickness of coating a number of UNK effects occur which must be taken into account and which make the measured value larger than the true cutting force indicated by UNK 1 ) STOP
START UNK knife STOP
START one of these is the fact that the knife employed , no matter how well UNK , will have a slightly UNK cutting edge STOP
START this UNK that UNK , the UNK angle , is no longer a constant to zero film thickness STOP
START the UNK of this UNK is , in the case of the UNK knife employed in the UNK , determined by the grain UNK of the UNK UNK and the UNK UNK UNK UNK together in the knife body and is in the order of UNK to UNK UNK STOP
START the force vector concept of UNK can readily be applied to this condition also STOP
START because the UNK angle af at the tip of the knife is very much smaller ( or even negative ) when compared to the value of UNK for the major portion of the knife , a very rapid increase in cutting force with thickness will result STOP
START this UNK to the relationship : af , where af is the UNK at zero thickness of the UNK of the slope indicated in UNK 1 ) , af is the thickness of the coating equivalent to the UNK off of the knife tip , af is a straight line first UNK of this UNK , and the other symbols are equivalent to those of UNK 1 ) STOP
START it can be seen that af is a constant , and is determined for the most part by the UNK of the knife STOP
START the UNK the knife , the higher is the value of af STOP
START the importance of a hard , UNK knife material like the UNK employed in the UNK immediately becomes apparent STOP
START UNK UNK would UNK very rapidly , making the value of af UNK STOP
START in extreme cases of very soft UNK this value may even change during the course of a measurement STOP
START knife friction STOP
START a second factor which enters into the practical measurement of the UNK determined cutting force is the UNK resistance caused by the bottom of the knife against the substrate STOP
START this is not a constant value like af , but UNK with the thickness of the coating and the direction and magnitude of the UNK r and af of UNK STOP
START under equilibrium conditions of cutting the UNK UNK a UNK af against the knife which tends to push it into the substrate or UNK it away from the substrate depending on the vector direction of af STOP
START the resultant friction force , af is thus directly proportional to af and consequently also to film thickness STOP
START the value of af can readily be UNK by determining the UNK force exerted on the knife while running over the previously UNK coating track under various external UNK STOP
START a straight line relationship is usually observed in a plot of af against load l , having slope UNK , and af STOP
START since the load l , under actual cutting conditions is caused by af , it can be seen that af STOP
START STOP
START the measured force , h , in cutting removal of coatings from their UNK consequently can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut the coating , af , that due to the UNK of the knife , af , and that due to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate , af , or af STOP
START the first two forces are directly UNK and depend upon film thickness , whereas af is independent of these two and is a constant for a given knife combination STOP
START these theoretical relationships are more clearly illustrated in fig7 and their sum can be seen to UNK in form with practical measurements made with the UNK as illustrated in the first portion of UNK for the cutting mechanism STOP
START UNK mechanism of cohesive failure STOP
START although a large number of coatings systems , particularly at low UNK fail UNK by the cutting mechanism , frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place STOP
START this is a UNK , dynamic type failure encountered with very UNK coatings UNK or very highly UNK films STOP
START this is shown in the UNK of UNK STOP
START the basic difference between the continuous cutting mechanism and that of the UNK mechanism is that instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously without UNK , UNK UNK occurs along the shear plane STOP
START the detailed mechanisms of this type of failure have been studied UNK by merchant for metal cutting , and the principles found can be directly applied to coatings STOP
START by studying high speed movies made of this type of failure , the sequence of relationships as UNK illustrated in UNK could be observed STOP
START in the first picture ( UNK ) the knife is just beginning to advance into the inclined surface which was left from the previous UNK formation STOP
START in the next , the shear plane angle is high , and UNK to the inclined work surface STOP
START with increasing advance of the knife into the coating the shear plane UNK to the coatings surface and the shear angle rapidly UNK STOP
START eventually , UNK occurs along the shear plane ( UNK ) , and the cycle UNK itself STOP
START merchant has found that the same basic relationships which describe the UNK and force systems in the case of the cutting mechanism can also be applied to the UNK UNK formation provided the proper values of UNK shear angle and UNK UNK thickness or UNK area are used STOP
START consequently , if the shear angle UNK is replaced by the UNK angle af , the relationships as described in UNK 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 6 ) will directly apply STOP
START the cracking mechanism STOP
START under equilibrium cutting conditions , the UNK UNK a force af against the coating and an equal opposite force af against the knife in the plane of the substrate as shown in UNK STOP
START if the UNK angle UNK of the knife is high enough and the friction angle UNK between the front of the knife and the back of the UNK is low enough to give a positive value for af , the resultant vector r will lie above the plane of the substrate STOP
START within only a few years , UNK plastics materials have managed to grow into an integral , and important , phase of the plastics industry -- and the end is still not yet in sight STOP
START urethane foam , as only one example , was only introduced UNK in this country in 1955 STOP
START yet last year's volume probably UNK 100 million UNK expectations are for a market of UNK million UNK UNK STOP
START many of the other UNK plastics , particularly the UNK , show similar growth potential STOP
START and there are even newer UNK plastics that are yet to be evaluated STOP
START as this issue goes to press , for example , one manufacturer has announced an UNK foam with outstanding UNK and impact strength ; ; STOP
START another reports that a UNK UNK , primarily for use in wire coating applications , is being investigated STOP
START on the following pages , each of the major commercial UNK plastics is described in detail , as to properties , applications , and methods of processing STOP
START it might be well to point out , however , some of the newer developments that have taken place within the past few months which might have a bearing on the future of the various UNK plastics involved STOP
START in urethane foams , for example , there has been a definite trend toward the UNK materials ( which are now available in UNK rigid foam systems ) and the emphasis is UNK on UNK molding STOP
START most manufacturers also seem to be UNK on UNK UNK or UNK grades of urethane foam that are aimed specifically at the UNK building markets STOP
START urethane foam as an UNK is also coming in for a good deal of attention STOP
START in one outstanding example , UNK UNK that by UNK to urethane foam UNK , they could increase the storage capacity of gas UNK to make them competitive with electric models STOP
START much interest has also been expressed in new techniques for processing the urethane foams , including UNK , UNK , and molding ( see article , UNK for details ) STOP
START and in meeting the demands for urethane foam as a UNK UNK , new UNK and new methods of UNK foam to a substrate have been developed STOP
START new techniques for automatic molding of UNK UNK UNK have helped UNK that particular material into a number of new consumer applications , including picnic UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , and UNK swimming UNK STOP
START two other UNK areas which contributed to UNK UNK growth during the year were UNK ( molded UNK UNK complicated UNK units ) and UNK building panels STOP
START UNK UNK UNK film or sheet -- claimed to be competitive UNK with paper -- also showed much potential , particularly for UNK STOP
START UNK panels for building utility shelters that consist of UNK paper UNK and rigid UNK foam UNK also aroused interest in the construction field STOP
START in UNK foam , the big news was the development of techniques for coating fabrics with the material ( for details , see UNK ) STOP
START better `` hand '' , a more UNK feel , and better UNK properties were claimed to be the result STOP
START several companies also saw possibilities in using the technique for UNK or molding UNK products with a slight UNK core that would reduce costs yet would not affect physical properties of the end product to any great extent STOP
START readers interested in additional information on foams are referred to the UNK plastics chart UNK in the technical data section and to the list of references which appears below STOP
START urethane foams STOP
START since the UNK UNK , when urethane foam first made its appearance in the american market , growth has been little short of fantastic STOP
START present estimates are that production UNK the UNK in 1960 ( UNK to UNK million UNK flexible , 10 or 11 million UNK rigid ) ; ; STOP
START by UNK , production may range from 200 to UNK million UNK flexible and from UNK to UNK million UNK rigid STOP
START the markets that have started to open up for the foam in the past year or so seem to justify the expectations STOP
START furniture UNK , as just one example , can easily take millions of pounds ; ; STOP
START UNK UNK UNK is under intensive evaluation by every major manufacturer ; ; STOP
START and use of the foam for UNK UNK is only now getting off the ground , with volume potential in the UNK STOP
START basic chemistry STOP
START urethane foams are , basically , reaction products of UNK materials and UNK ( usually UNK UNK ) STOP
START blowing can be either one of two types -- carbon UNK gas UNK by the reaction of water on the UNK or mechanical blowing through the use of a UNK liquid such as a UNK UNK STOP
START the most important factor in determining what properties the UNK will have is quite naturally the type of UNK UNK that is used in its production STOP
START originally , the main types used were various UNK of UNK STOP
START these are still in wide use today , particularly in UNK formulations , for such applications as UNK for UNK structural panels , UNK UNK , UNK safety UNK , arm rests , etc STOP
START more recently , UNK -- again in varied UNK , molecular weights , and UNK -- have come into use at first for the flexible foams , just UNK for the UNK STOP
START the UNK UNK are claimed to give flexible UNK a UNK action which is much desired in UNK STOP
START although the first UNK foams on the market had to be produced by the UNK UNK method , today , thanks to new UNK , they can be produced by a UNK technique STOP
START it is possible that the UNK foams may soon be molded on a production basis in UNK UNK with more UNK contours and with superior properties to UNK foam STOP
START the UNK urethane foam is generally produced with UNK UNK UNK ; ; STOP
START the UNK group generally consists of foams produced with UNK UNK or UNK UNK modified with a UNK STOP
START one shot UNK STOP
START in the UNK system , the UNK and UNK are mixed UNK and no UNK occurs STOP
START the UNK can be accomplished at some future time at a different location by the addition of the correct proportion of UNK in solution STOP
START in UNK , the UNK , UNK or UNK UNK , UNK , and other UNK are mixed directly and a foam is produced immediately STOP
START basically , this means that simpler processing equipment ( the mixture has good flowing characteristics ) and less external heat ( the UNK reaction is UNK and UNK internal heat ) are required in UNK UNK , although , at the same time , the problems of controlling the conditions of UNK UNK are critical ones STOP

START at the conclusion of the washing , 8 UNK of water at UNK ( UNK are automatically UNK from the UNK UNK to the washing UNK , 4 UNK to each UNK STOP
START this operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes STOP
START during the UNK operation the volume in the UNK gradually increases until UNK from the main drain begins STOP
START at this point the UNK are UNK so that the UNK box drain will discharge directly into the waste line and the main UNK drain is set at the UNK mark on the drain UNK STOP

START the run is complete when all the water has UNK off into the waste line STOP
START by this procedure UNK UNK in two stages , first by UNK until the time when the UNK are separated and thereafter by displacement of the UNK liquor by clean UNK water , since UNK liquor UNK from the specimens at the UNK passes directly to waste from the UNK box UNK STOP

START the UNK gain of a single stage with af ( flux gain ) is , to a first UNK , given by the product of the UNK sensitivity s ( UNK UNK ) , the anode potential v ( UNK ) , and the phosphor conversion efficiency p ( UNK ) STOP
START in general , p is a function of v and the current density , but it shall here be assumed as a constant STOP
START the UNK efficiency af of a UNK depends on the maximum UNK sensitivity af and on the UNK distribution of the incident light af by the relation : af where af is UNK UNK UNK sensitivity STOP
START af is standard UNK function STOP
START the UNK flux gain of a single stage is given by : af STOP
START if the input light distribution falls beyond the visible range , af as expected , since af STOP

START the numerical UNK of the fibers is given by : af where af STOP
START the angle af is measured in the medium of index af STOP
START settled UNK , as generally used in image UNK , have low optical contact with the substrate surface , hence af shall be assumed STOP
START the numerical UNK should be in general close to unity STOP
START this condition can be satisfied , e.g, with af and af or equivalent glass combinations STOP
START a sufficiently good UNK for determining the end reflection losses r can be obtained from the angle independent UNK formula : af STOP
START for phosphor to fiber and fiber to air surfaces , and assuming af , we obtain af percent STOP
START this value may be reduced to UNK percent by means of a ( very thin ) glass layer of index UNK STOP
START hence , the af factor for the output fiber UNK is af STOP
START as the index of UNK of UNK surfaces of the UNK lies around 2 , the UNK losses at the UNK UNK are about UNK percent and the af factor for the UNK UNK is UNK STOP
START it might be UNK that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further STOP
START the internal losses are due to UNK and the small but UNK losses suffered in the numerous internal UNK due to UNK from the prescribed , cylindrical fiber UNK and minute UNK of the UNK UNK STOP
START these losses depend on fiber diameter and length , UNK UNK , the mean value of the loss per internal reflection and last , but not least , on the angular distribution of the incident light STOP
START explicit expressions ( integral UNK ) are given in the literature STOP
START lacking reliable data for some of the variables , we are UNK on experimental data of about 20 percent internal losses for 1 long , small ( 5 - 10 m ) diameter fibers STOP
START this relatively high value is probably due to the small fiber UNK increasing the number of internal UNK STOP
START since we are considering here relatively small diameter ( 1 - UNK inches ) fiber plates , their average thickness can be kept below 1 inch and their internal losses may be assumed as 15 percent ( per UNK ) STOP
START the packing efficiency , UNK of fiber plates did not receive much attention in the literature , probably as it is high for the larger fibers generally used , until rather recently STOP
START for circular fibers in a closely UNK UNK UNK , the packing efficiency is given by : af where af , and UNK is the ratio of the area of a circle to that of the UNK UNK STOP
START for the small diameter fibers now UNK feasible and required for about 100 af resolution , af STOP
START the UNK thickness is about UNK m , hence , af and af STOP
START thus , the efficiency UNK UNK is given by -- af or approximately 50 percent each STOP
START it must be remembered that the fiber plates replace a glass window and a ( UNK ) UNK , in addition to an optical output lens system STOP
START the efficiency af of an af lens at the UNK af is : af STOP
START UNK UNK , the end losses of the UNK UNK and the output window af would be 6 percent and 8 percent STOP
START thus , the combined efficiency of the elements replaced by the two fiber plates ( with a combined efficiency of UNK ) is UNK or about six times less than that of the two fiber plates STOP

START including the brightness gain af due to the af area UNK , the UNK gain of a fiber coupled double stage image UNK is : af STOP
START it is obvious that the careful choice of UNK which UNK af for a given input e ( in the case of the second stage , for the first phosphor screen emission ) is very important STOP

START resolution limitations in a single stage STOP
START the resolution limitations for a single stage are given by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system as well as the resolution capabilities of the UNK UNK screen STOP
START the resolution capabilities of an UNK system depend on both the choice of UNK and UNK UNK STOP
START it has been stated previously that a UNK UNK system UNK a lower resolution than a UNK system or a system with unity UNK STOP
START furthermore , the UNK UNK depend on the chosen high voltage STOP

START it is obvious that such an influence can only be expected in the final stage of an image UNK at rather high output levels STOP
START space charge influences will also decrease at increased UNK STOP
START UNK systems of the UNK type have been tested for resolution capabilities by applying UNK STOP
START a resolution of 70 - UNK UNK per UNK appears to be feasible STOP
START the inherent resolution of a UNK phosphor screen UNK with increasingly UNK thickness ( with increasing anode voltage ) , UNK with UNK UNK ( thus the advantage of UNK phosphor UNK ) and might be UNK by the normally used aluminum mirror STOP
START thus , in general , UNK light optical effects , light UNK , and electron UNK determine the obtainable resolution limit STOP
START it should be noted that UNK , due to `` UNK '' UNK within the UNK screen by electron impact , appears to be important only if anode UNK in excess of 30 UNK are UNK STOP
START it has been stated that settled UNK phosphor UNK may have a UNK resolution of 60 af at high voltage values of approximately 20 aj STOP
START for the further discussion , we shall thus assume an electron optical resolution of UNK af and phosphor screen resolution of 60 af STOP
START the set of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy STOP

START it is the subject of chapter 4 STOP
START the essential characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages with no UNK was first isolated by UNK STOP
START he recognized that whatever transformation may be UNK in the first stage of an UNK process , the remaining stages must use an optimal UNK policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage , if there is to be any chance of UNK the complete process STOP
START moreover , by UNK varying the operating conditions in the first stage and always using the optimal UNK policy for the remaining stages , we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all r stages STOP
START proceeding in this way , from one to two and from two to three stages , we may gradually build up the policy for any number STOP
START at each step of the calculation the operating variables of only one stage need be varied STOP
START to see how important this economy is , let us suppose that there are m operating variables at each stage and that the state is specified by n variables ; ; STOP
START then the search for the maximum at any one stage will require a number of operations of order af ( where a is some number not UNK large ) STOP
START to proceed from one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed states must be investigated to allow for UNK ; ; STOP
START this number will be of the order of af STOP
START if , however , we are seeking the optimal UNK policy for a given feed state , only one search for a maximum is required at the final step STOP
START thus a number of operations of the order of af are required STOP
START if all the operating variables were varied simultaneously , af operations would be required to do the same job , and as r increases this increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations required by the dynamic program STOP
START but even more important than this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy , namely , that for the given feed state and r stages STOP
START in contrast , the dynamic program produces this policy and a whole family of policies for any smaller number of stages STOP
START if the problem is UNK to require a complete coverage of feed states , af operations are needed by the dynamic program and af by the direct search STOP
START but af is UNK larger than r STOP
START no UNK is more UNK than that which believes that the high speed of modern UNK UNK allows for use of the UNK of methods in UNK out a result STOP
START suppose that af , and that the average operation requires only af UNK STOP
START then the dynamic program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would take more than three UNK ! ! STOP
START the principle of UNK thus brings a vital organization into the search for the optimal policy of a UNK decision process STOP
START UNK ( 1957 ) has UNK in the following terms : STOP
START `` an optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are , the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with respect to the state resulting from the first decision '' STOP
START this is the principle which we will UNK in every case to set up a functional equation STOP
START it appears in a form that is UNK suited to the powers of the UNK UNK STOP
START at the same time , every device that can be employed to reduce the number of variables is of the greatest value , and it is one of the attractive features of dynamic UNK that room is left for UNK in using the special features of the problem to this end STOP
START UNK the UNK UNK process STOP
START consider the process illustrated in UNK , consisting of r distinct stages STOP
START these will be UNK in the direction opposite to the flow of the process stream , so that stage r is the t stage from the end STOP
START let the state of the stream leaving stage r be UNK by a vector af and the operating variables of stage r by af STOP
START thus af UNK the state of the feed to the UNK process , and af the state of the product from the last stage STOP
START each stage UNK the state af of its feed to the state af in a way that depends on the operating variables af STOP
START we write this af STOP
START this transformation is UNK determined by af and we therefore speak of the process as UNK STOP
START in practical situations there will be restrictions on the UNK operating conditions , and we regard the UNK as UNK to a fixed and UNK set s STOP
START the set of UNK af UNK the operating policy or , more briefly , the policy , and a policy is UNK if all the af belong to s STOP
START when the policy has been chosen , the state of the product can be obtained from the state of the feed by repeated application of the transformation ( 1 ) ; ; STOP
START thus af STOP
START the objective function , which is to be UNK , is some function , usually UNK continuous , of the product state STOP
START let this be UNK by af STOP
START an optimal policy is an UNK policy af which UNK the objective function p STOP
START the policy may not be unique but the maximum value of p certainly is , and once the policy is specified this maximum can be calculated by ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) as a function of the feed state af STOP
START let af where the UNK is over all UNK policies af STOP
START when it is necessary to be specific we say that the optimal policy is an optimal UNK policy with respect to the feed state af STOP
START for any choice of UNK policy af in the first stage , the state of the stream leaving this stage is given by af STOP
START this is the feed state of the subsequent af stages which , according to the principle of UNK , must use an optimal UNK policy with respect to this state STOP
START this will result in a value af of the objective function , and when af is chosen correctly this will give af , the maximum of the objective function STOP
START thus af where the UNK is over all UNK policies af , and af is related to af by ( 5 ) STOP
START the sequence of UNK ( 6 ) can be solved for af when af is known , and clearly af , the UNK being over all UNK af STOP
START the set of UNK ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , and the starting equation ( 7 ) is of a UNK type well suited to UNK on the UNK UNK STOP
START in finding the optimal UNK policy from that of af stages , only the function af is needed STOP
START when af has been found it may be transferred into the storage location of af and the whole calculation repeated STOP
START we also see how the results may be presented , although if n , the number of state variables , is large any UNK will become UNK STOP
START a table or set of tables may be set out as in table UNK STOP
START to UNK the optimal UNK policy with respect to the feed state af , we enter section r of this table at the state af and find immediately from the last column the maximum value of the objective function STOP
START in the third column is given the optimal policy for stage r , and in the fourth , the resulting state of the stream when this policy is used STOP
START since by the principle of UNK the remaining stages use an optimal UNK policy with respect to af , we may enter section af of the table at this state af and read off the optimal policy for stage af and the resulting state af STOP
START proceeding in this way up the table we UNK the complete optimal policy and , if it is desired , we can check on af by UNK af at the last stage STOP
START it may be that the objective function depends not only on af but also on af , as when the cost of the operating policy is considered STOP
START a UNK reflection shows that the above UNK and presentation work equally well in this case STOP
START a form of objective function that we shall often have occasion to consider is af STOP
START here p represents the value of the stream in state p and q the cost of operating the stage with conditions q STOP
START hence p is the increase in value of the stream UNK the cost of operation , that is , the net profit STOP
START if af UNK the net profit from stage r and af , then the principle of UNK gives af STOP
START this sequence of UNK may be started with the remark that with no process af there is no profit , i.e, af STOP
START UNK the UNK UNK process STOP
START the process in which the outcome of any one stage is known only UNK is also of interest , although for chemical UNK design it is not as important as the UNK process STOP
START in this case the stage r operating with conditions af UNK the state of the stream from af to af , but only the probability distribution of af is known STOP
START this is specified by a distribution function af such that the probability that af lies in some region d of the stage space is af STOP
START we cannot now speak of UNK the value of the objective function , since this function is now known only in a UNK sense STOP
START we can , however , UNK its expected value STOP
START for a single stage we may define af where the UNK is by choice of af STOP
START we thus have an optimal policy which UNK the expected value of the objective function for a given af STOP
START if we consider a process in which the outcome of one stage is known before passage to the next , then the principle of UNK shows that the policy in subsequent stages should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first STOP
START then af , the UNK being over all UNK af and the integration over the whole of stage space STOP
START the type of presentation of results used in the UNK process may be used here , except that now the fourth column is UNK STOP
START the third column gives the optimal policy , but we must wait to see the outcome of stage r and enter the preceding section of the table at this state STOP
START the discussion of the optimal policy when the outcome of one stage is not known before passing to the next is a very much more difficult matter STOP
START UNK the continuous UNK process STOP
START in many cases it is not possible to divide the process into a UNK number of UNK stages , since the state of the stream is transformed in a continuous manner through the process STOP
START we replace r , the number of the stage from the end of the process , by t , a continuous variable which measures the `` distance '' of the point considered from the end of the process STOP
START the word distance is used here in a rather general sense ; ; STOP
START it may in fact be the time that will UNK before the end of the process STOP
START if t is the total `` length '' of the process , its feed state may be UNK by a vector UNK and the product state by UNK STOP
START p UNK the state at any point t and q the vector of operating variables there STOP
START a UNK platform system , using UNK UNK , is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the UNK combination STOP
START the UNK UNK platform with reasonable response characteristics UNK with an approximate equation of motion , UNK UNK effects , as follows : af where UNK is a UNK applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro STOP
START the platform angle UNK is the angle about which the gyro is controlling STOP
START this is normally UNK the gyro input axis , UNK away from the gyro output or UNK axis STOP
START the gyro angular momentum is defined by h STOP
START thus if the gyro and UNK combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the UNK axis , the system can be UNK with an angular velocity af if a UNK is supplied to the gyro output axis aj STOP
START it is assumed that the UNK are designed with electrical UNK so that a UNK can be applied about their output UNK STOP
START in the system shown in UNK , the accelerometer output is UNK and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro UNK UNK STOP
START this UNK causes the entire system to UNK about the UNK axis , since the response to af STOP
START if the UNK are correct , the platform UNK in such a direction as to reduce the accelerometer output to zero STOP
START as the accelerometer output is UNK , the UNK applied to the gyro output axis UNK and , therefore , the rate UNK STOP
START finally , when the accelerometer output is zero , the entire system remains UNK , and the platform is , by definition , UNK STOP
START a mathematical block UNK for the leveling system is shown in UNK STOP
START the platform is initially off level by the angle aj STOP
START the angle UNK by the platform UNK UNK UNK by g is the effective acceleration acting on the accelerometer STOP
START af is the scale factor of the accelerometer ( af ) STOP
START the voltage af is UNK by af and applied to the gyro UNK with scale factor af STOP
START finally , the UNK platform characteristic is represented by af STOP
START the system as indicated in UNK is fundamental and simple because the UNK effects of both the platform UNK and the accelerometer have been UNK STOP
START with these factors included , an upper limit is placed on the UNK loop gain by stability considerations STOP
START in this type of system , a high loop gain is desirable because it provides a fast response time STOP
START when the frequency response characteristics of practical components are considered , their effect on stability does not present the most serious limit on the system loop gain STOP
START the time required for the system to reach a level position is approximately UNK proportional to the UNK loop gain STOP
START in addition , the UNK frequency for input UNK is approximately proportional to the UNK loop gain ; ; STOP
START i.e, high loop gain causes the system to respond to UNK components of UNK STOP
START this problem usually determines the lower limit of loop gain rather than response time STOP
START it must be noticed in UNK that the accelerometer UNK to any input acceleration STOP
START the equation relating input acceleration to output platform angle is af STOP
START in practice , the UNK leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the UNK STOP
START when the system is arranged for automatic leveling , the platform UNK respond to any UNK components of acceleration acting on the UNK STOP
START there are many such components of acceleration present due to the effect of wind UNK , engine noise , UNK around the vehicle , etc STOP
START one of the greatest problems associated with automatic leveling is establishing a true level in the presence of UNK acceleration noise STOP
START one solution to the problem is to operate with a low loop gain and to include UNK UNK STOP
START this technique causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components such as the platform UNK STOP
START since a lower loop gain and UNK UNK increases the response time , a practical UNK must be reached STOP
START one of the most desirable solutions is achieved by the use of a UNK UNK for af STOP
START the UNK is designed so that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain UNK level STOP
START below this level , the UNK gain af is proportional and is of small value , in order to provide adequate noise UNK STOP
START the effect is that the platform returns from an UNK position at a rapid rate until it is nearly level , at which point the platform is controlled by a proportional UNK with low enough frequency response so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process STOP
START when the system is on automatic leveling , the gyro drift is UNK by the output of the leveling system ( UNK af ) STOP
START the platform actually UNK off level so that the accelerometer output , when UNK by af , will supply the correct current to the gyro UNK to UNK the gyro drift STOP
START the amount of platform UNK required depends upon the scale factors of the system STOP
START UNK STOP
START practical leveling considerations STOP
START the automatic leveling system described in this section is readily UNK to a UNK platform consisting of three UNK UNK STOP
START the system requires some UNK of flight equipment UNK STOP
START however , the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled UNK with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform STOP
START this leveling system will hold the platform UNK , automatically , as long as the system is UNK STOP
START a useful UNK of this system is that the information necessary to set the gyro drift UNK is available from the UNK necessary to hold the system in level STOP
START the leveling process can be accomplished UNK , and the results are as satisfactory as those obtained with automatic equipment STOP
START the process consists in turning the platform UNK until the UNK of both UNK are zero STOP
START the turning is accomplished by applying voltage to the gyro UNK described above STOP
START in brief , the human UNK UNK af in UNK and UNK STOP
START UNK leveling requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer UNK STOP
START if high accuracy is required in UNK leveling , it is usually necessary to UNK or UNK UNK the accelerometer UNK ( this also UNK the noise problem ) STOP
START with integration , the effect of a small acceleration ( or small platform UNK angle ) can be seen after a time STOP
START however , skill is required on the part of an operator to level a platform to any degree of accuracy STOP
START also , it requires more time as compared to the automatic approach STOP
START UNK leveling is UNK if the platform must be maintained accurately level for any prolonged period of time STOP
START the operator must continually supply the correct amount of turning current to the gyro UNK so that the effect of gyro drift is UNK STOP
START this process is especially difficult since gyro UNK is typically random STOP
START UNK STOP
START platform heading STOP
START platform heading consists of UNK the sensitive axis of the UNK parallel to the desired UNK system of the UNK STOP
START in simpler terms , it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction STOP
START for purely UNK UNK , two techniques are available to accomplish the platform heading : use of external or UNK equipment to establish proper heading ; ; STOP
START use of the characteristics of the platform components for an indication of true heading STOP
START the choice of the heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy requirements , field conditions , and the time available to accomplish the heading STOP
START UNK STOP
START external determination of heading -- UNK technique STOP
START with the UNK platform UNK , it can be headed in the proper direction by using UNK techniques STOP
START the platform UNK must be slightly modified for this procedure STOP
START before the UNK are mounted on the platform , the direction of their sensitive axis must be accurately determined STOP
START a mirror is mounted on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror is UNK to the sensitive axis of the unit STOP
START transit STOP
START a precision transit is set up so that it is UNK with respect to true north STOP
START this can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing UNK techniques STOP
START with the transit set up , a mirror on one of the UNK is UNK and the platform is turned until it is UNK STOP
START the UNK procedure includes the use of a UNK for the transit to project a beam of light , which is UNK by crossed UNK , on the accelerometer mirror STOP
START when the platform is UNK , the reflected image of the crossed UNK can be seen exactly UNK upon the original crossed UNK STOP
START the images can easily be UNK with a high degree of accuracy STOP
START the platform is turned as required by supplying UNK to the appropriate gyro UNK STOP
START although this technique is simple and satisfactory , one practical difficulty does exist : the direction of true north must be known for each UNK point STOP
START however , this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a UNK team can establish a true north base line with a few UNK work STOP
START in many installations , the UNK platform is raised off the ground a considerable height when it is mounted in the vehicle before flight STOP
START with this situation , it is difficult to sight in on the platform with UNK equipment STOP
START if the platform is not too high off the ground , a transit can be mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform STOP
START obviously , the heading accuracy is UNK by such techniques since errors are introduced because of motion of the stand STOP
START UNK STOP
START the transit can be replaced by an UNK STOP
START this instrument provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular UNK of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform on true heading STOP
START the electrical signal from the UNK is UNK and supplied to the UNK UNK STOP
START if the UNK is correct , the platform will turn until the heading error angle is zero STOP
START information is also available from this UNK system to set the drift UNK for the UNK gyro STOP
START if the UNK gyro is UNK , a current UNK by the UNK is delivered to the gyro UNK to UNK the drift STOP
START if the drift error is systematic , it can be UNK with a UNK circuit which can be arranged and adjusted to supply the required UNK current STOP
START electrical UNK STOP
START it is possible to locate an angular electrical UNK , which will indicate the angular deviation between the true heading direction and the platform STOP
START essentially , the UNK or reference portion of the UNK is established with respect to the true heading direction , and the platform is turned either UNK or automatically until the angular electrical UNK signal is reduced to zero STOP
START UNK STOP
START UNK heading STOP
START UNK UNK is an automatic heading system which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true heading STOP
START for the case of a purely UNK UNK consisting of three UNK UNK , a UNK system is used where the sensitive axis of the x accelerometer is parallel to the UNK direction at the base point , and the UNK accelerometer sensitive axis is parallel to the UNK direction at the base point STOP
START the UNK are mounted UNK on the platform STOP
START thus , if one accelerometer is properly UNK , the other is also STOP
START the input axis of the appropriate UNK are parallel to the sensitive direction of the UNK STOP
START figure UNK shows a platform system with the gyro UNK arranged as described above STOP
START the platform is UNK and properly headed , so that the UNK input axis is parallel to the UNK direction and the UNK input axis is parallel to the UNK direction STOP
START the input axis of the x gyro , when pointing in the UNK direction , is always UNK to the UNK axis of earth STOP
START if the platform is not properly headed , the UNK input axis will see a component of the earth's UNK STOP
START the UNK of this UNK by the x gyro can be UNK to direct the platform into proper heading STOP
START in UNK , the input axis of the UNK platform is shown at some point on the earth STOP
START the point is at a UNK UNK , and the platform is at an error in heading east STOP
START the earth is UNK at an angular velocity UNK equal to one revolution per 24 UNK STOP
START when the platform is level , UNK is a UNK about the UNK axis of the platform af STOP
START since the earth is rotating and the UNK UNK platform is fixed with respect to a reference in space , an observer on the earth will see the platform rotating ( with respect to the earth ) STOP
