Dependency Parsing Errors:
1. The accuracy of Dependency Parsing decreases with increase in sentence length.
2. Dependency parsers often does not capture the fact that words have arities. Due to this, there is a chance of erroneous parsing results.

One of the improvements for Dependency Parsing to omit these errors is to add probabilistic dependencies. 


Context free Parsing Errors:
1. The accuracy of the Context Free parsing decreases with the increase in sentence length.
2. Attaching a different label for a word when the sentence contains a indirect question.

For example: Do you know that I know?

(ROOT
  (S
    (VP
      (VB do)
      (SBAR
        (S
          (NP (PRP you))
          (VP
            (VBP know)
            (SBAR (IN that) (S (NP (PRP I)) (VP (VBP know))) (. ?))))))
    (. .)))

Here the label attached for the node is S, but it should be SQ.

One of the improvements for Context free Parsing can be to improve how well it builds the sentence structure rather than concentrating on improving the pos Tagging.

Context Free Parsers are generally faster and more accurate than Dependency Parsers.
